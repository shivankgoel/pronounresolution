bnn946	In one sense , this limits him ; unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez , who has a distinctive Latin voice , Mr. E1 's style offers little that can be labeled `` Egyptian .

bnn824	If Mr. E1 wanted to be accepted by the people of E2 , he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences .

bnn1072	But , as E1 noted , the context shows that Mr. E2 's `` me alone '' remark referred not to her alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else .	her	91	E1	9	FALSE	E2	47	TRUE	unk
bnn478	Mr. E1 has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods .

bnn2438	Mr. E1 's relationship to E2 intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials say .

bnn1972	Mr. E1 , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended E2 before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago .

bnn2476	Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. E1 was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively .

bnn1222	A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. E1 has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue .

bnn2424	Mr. E1 might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of E2 's dire economic situation , says Mr. Moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for her own mismanagement .	her	218	E1	4	TRUE	E2	62	FALSE	unk

bnn1320	Mr. E1 of E2 said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter .

bnn1088	But unlike Mr. Ruder , who during the 1987 crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed , Mr. E1 is turning the market drop to his own advantage , using it to further his agenda for the E2 . In an interview and in congressional testimony , she repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market .	she	279	E1	133	TRUE	E2	225	FALSE	unk

bnn1791	E1 continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , Mr. E2 said .

bnn871	Mr. E1 lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985 .

bnn483	Mr. E1 would appear to see his central task , however , as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo .

bnn779	Administration officials traveling with E1 in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. E2 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as she is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections .	she	159	E1	40	FALSE	E2	73	TRUE	unk
bnn2922	But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help E1 regain power , Mr. E2 should never be underestimated .

She	143	E1	46	FALSE	E2	68	TRUE	unk
bnn2645	E1 says Mr. E2 was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment . `` On occasion , she paid a high price , '' Mr. Wachter concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors .	she	126	E1	0	FALSE	E2	12	TRUE	unk
bnn1834	Already last week , Mr. E1 started overhauling E2 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .

bnn1220	A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. E1 has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue . In 1974 , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations , he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of her leadership during his term in E2 in expanding family-planning services for the poor .	her	267	E1	68	TRUE	E2	301	FALSE	unk

bnn1522	Mr. E1 is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open .

bnn863	A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron E1 was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. E2 faced the media . Her campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations it paid almost $ 10,000 for what it said was a `` get-out-the-vote '' effort by black activist Sonny Carson , a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is `` anti-white .

bnn2309	Mr. E1 , age 52 , is known as an old-guard ironfist , one likely to continue the method of running a country that the Berlin Wall made famous .

bnn940	Mr. E1 's E2 also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God , not crime , for their salvation .

bnn564	While admitting such a move would be `` devastating '' to most creditors , Judge E1 told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that she was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on E2 's shrinking estate and about the fact that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form .	she	145	E1	81	TRUE	E2	212	FALSE	unk

bnn2049	E1 might have been predicting the course of his own career . His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe , the inferior `` E2 '' -LRB- 1958 -RRB- , at times read almost like a parody of her previous work .	her	210	E1	0	TRUE	E2	147	FALSE	unk
bnn2682	Moreover , Mr. E1 sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term .

bnn617	In 1976 , as an upstart in the eyes of Switzerland 's establishment , Mr. E1 laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on E2 , the country 's traditional shoemaker .

bnn327	Special E1 noted that E2 managed horse-breeding in a businesslike way : He kept detailed accounts , practiced soil conservation , enhanced his experience by consulting experts , spent several hours a day doing chores , and dropped the sideline when his best brood mare died . Yet she took little businesslike care with his cattle : He had no prior experience and did n't seek business counsel about them .	she	280	E1	8	FALSE	E2	22	TRUE	unk
bnn1215	And E1 is n't likely to have any new products ready for market until at least 1992 , Ms. E2 added . `` The company 's stock is trading at 40 times next year 's numbers , and that 's too much , '' he said .	he	196	E1	4	FALSE	E2	89	TRUE	unk

bnn131	Associates say Mr. E1 picked up that careful approach to management as president of E2 .

bnn242	When the hacker moved , Mr. E1 moved too , calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion .

bnn738	Mr. E1 has also encouraged her staff to work more closely with E2 's technical staffs to help prevent future litigation .	her	27	E1	4	TRUE	E2	63	FALSE	unk

bnn872	Mr. E1 lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985 .

bnn889	But Mr. E1 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple cart . Despite many doubts about her candidacy , white E2 Yorkers -- who gave Mr. Dinkins 30 % of their votes in the primary -- are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani .	her	155	E1	8	TRUE	E2	177	FALSE	unk

bnn1969	Mr. E1 , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at E2 hearings two years ago .

bnn2519	Mr. E1 , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , inherited the problems of E2 , based in Irvine , Calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law .

bnn610	After the transaction , Mr. E1 estimates the value of his 20 % stake in the new company , to be held by his E2 , will be about 1 billion Swiss francs .

bnn1038	Further , I think Mr. E1 made a poor choice in picking `` A Fish Called Wanda '' as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies .

bnn2343	Sen. E1 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run .

bnn1790	Mr. E1 said tighter operating controls have enabled E2 to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit .

bnn2694	Mr. E1 never said how much E2 stock he had bought , only that his holdings were `` substantial . '' However , she only received federal clearance to buy more than $ 15 million of the stock on Sept. 20 , when the price rose $ 2 a share to $ 78.50 .	she	110	E1	4	TRUE	E2	27	FALSE	unk

bnn2656	Mr. E1 's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic , cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel , `` An Artist of the Floating World , '' set in Japan after the war .
