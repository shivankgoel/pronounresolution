     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coast Savings Financial Inc.</ENAMEX> reported a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> loss , citing a previously announced capital restructuring program .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> thrift holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 92.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.98</NUMEX> a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coast</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">67 cents</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago quarter</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> results have been restated to comply with government regulations .
     The restructuring program is designed to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's tangible capital ratio .
     It includes removing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 242 million</NUMEX> in good will from the books , issuing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52 million</NUMEX> in convertible bonds .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> charged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 46 million</NUMEX> against earnings in reducing goodwill , added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> to its general loan loss reserves and established a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said its junk-bond portfolio after these moves had been reduced to less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> of assets .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> is launching a massive corporate advertising campaign that will put the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> 's name in TV commercials for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX> , when it stopped advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television .
     The campaign , a patriotic celebration of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">200th</NUMEX> anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> , does n't mention cigarettes or smoking ; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> .
     But even before it begins , the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> , who criticize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> 's attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> democracy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> , which became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's largest food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> with its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.9 billion</NUMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kraft Inc.</ENAMEX> , seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> country .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's research suggests that its name recognition among most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> remains unusually low , although its array of brands -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jell-O</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cheez Whiz</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> -- blanket supermarket shelves .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is expected to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 30 million</NUMEX> a year on its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> corporate campaign , created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     The initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> hopes that by taking its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> theme to the airwaves , in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publications</ENAMEX> , it will reach the broadest possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     Until now , its corporate ads , mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts , have appeared almost exclusively in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> -- whether in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toledo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tucson</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Topeka</ENAMEX> -- have n't got a clue who we are , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy L. Smith</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of corporate affairs .
     `` If they think well of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> through our support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> , it follows they 'll think well of our products . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> commercial , which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression , is n't designed to have any special appeal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> typically tries to defend the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> with free-choice arguments , `` this has nothing to do with cigarettes , nor will it ever , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     But some anti-smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> disagree , expressing anger at what they see as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's attempt to purchase innocence by association .
     `` I 'm outraged because this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is portraying itself at the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture and political freedom and in fact it 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">killer</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Pertschuk</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> and a tobacco-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> .
     `` It should be treated like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Medellin</ENAMEX> -LCB- drug -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">mafia</ENAMEX> , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Founding Fathers</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pertschuk</ENAMEX> adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> 's political strategy .
     These include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> , and wooing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> by portraying itself as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of civil rights .
     -LRB- The commercial features , among others , the voice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX> , the slain civil rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> 's approach will be effective , but they agree that the ads ' implied smoking message is unmistakable .
     `` This is clever , subliminal advertising that really says , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Smokers</ENAMEX> have rights , too , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Ries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trout & Ries Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , marketing strategy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Winger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Consulting Group</ENAMEX> , adds : `` It 's very popular to drape yourself in the flag <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     If you can do that and at the same time send a message that supports your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , that 's brilliant . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands Inc.</ENAMEX> say they have no plans to follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> 's lead .
     -LRB- Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> is currently under fire for having sent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80-second</TIMEX> videotapes touting its Now brand to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> who smoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Carltons</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     Despite the criticism , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> 's corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube .
     `` They are n't showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Madison</ENAMEX> taking a puff or lighting up , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tribe</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of constitutional law at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard University</ENAMEX> .
     `` All they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> itself .

     Technology stocks woke up , helping the over-the-counter market rise from its recent doldrums .
     The Nasdaq Composite Index surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.26</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.94 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">455.63</NUMEX> .
     It was the market 's biggest gain since rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 7</NUMEX> points on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> .
     Advancing OTC stocks outpaced decliners by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,120</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">806</NUMEX> .
     But the move lagged a stronger rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> issues .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's composite index was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 1.4 %</NUMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's gain was led by its biggest industrial stocks .
     The Nasdaq 100 rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.08</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">445.23</NUMEX> .
     The Financial Index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and insurance issues added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.19</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">447.76</NUMEX> .
     Other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the Transportation Index , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.55</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475.35</NUMEX> , and the Utility Index , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.68</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">730.37</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Market System</ENAMEX> volume improved to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94,425,000</NUMEX> shares from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's biggest technology stocks were in the forefront of the rally .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81 3\/4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oracle Systems</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 1\/4</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 3\/4</NUMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who watch the stocks warned the rise may be yet another `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one-day</TIMEX> phenomenon . ''
     Technology stocks bore the brunt of the OTC market 's recent sell-off , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say it 's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around .
     But , they caution , conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> would do well to sell into the strength .
     `` They are always the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be sold when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are taking profits , because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are most scared of the high-technology stocks , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin West</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ladenburg Thalmann</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lanyi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , which specializes in emerging growth stocks .
     The technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> includes many of the OTC market 's biggest stocks , which dominate the market-weighted Nasdaq Composite Index .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say rallies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> historically have lifted the market , while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted share prices broadly .
     But increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who try to follow its dips and swings .
     The stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows .
     Some even claim the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> has become a lagging , not leading , indicator .
     The technology sector of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Equity Market Index has risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 6.24 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , while the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.35 %</NUMEX> .
     While the composite index lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a third</NUMEX> of its year-to-date gains in the market 's recent decline , the technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's gains were more than halved .
     The OTC technology sector is far from a cohesive unit .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is divided primarily between software , semiconductors and computers .
     While computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry , many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> is up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</NUMEX> .
     The technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is also split between large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and small , with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip issues in the institutional marketplace , while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     The volatility of smaller technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> has served the group well overall in recent stock trading , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> 's technology stock indexes .
     The brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> tracks technology stocks with its Technology Index , which appreciated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10.59 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of this year</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> also tracks smaller technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> as a subset of the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     That index , which contains technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> or less , gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.97 %</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30 this year</TIMEX> -- still lagging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500 , but leading larger technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , bank stocks lagged behind the overall OTC market .
     The Nasdaq Bank Index rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">432.78</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Jennison</ENAMEX> , who trades bank stocks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , said the stocks tend to fall behind because they are n't traded as much as many other issues .
     But , he added , interest-rate-sensitive stocks in general are stalled .
     `` The interest-rate sensitives are n't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what the -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> -RRB- will do , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennison</ENAMEX> said .
     He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will scour the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> employment report , due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates .
     On the other hand , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennison</ENAMEX> noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> gave small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle index-arbitrage-related program trades for its accounts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> , with its in-house order execution system , has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over-the-counter market .
     The trading has been blamed for much of the market 's recent volatility .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> topped the most-active list , as its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> depository receipts climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 5\/8</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6.6 million</NUMEX> ADRs traded .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> said it would waive its `` golden share '' in the luxury auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> vote to allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> to acquire more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The announcement effectively removes the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> as an impediment to a takeover of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , which is being stalked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> was another active takeover stock .
     It surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.7 million</NUMEX> shares after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> agreed to be acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai Pharmaceutical</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 110 million</NUMEX> -- almost double the market price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Priam Corp.</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/32</NUMEX> after filing for protection from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 3\/8</NUMEX> .

     Assuming final enactment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , the prohibition will take effect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">96 days later</TIMEX> , or in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early February</TIMEX> .
     On a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">394</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> roll call , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> adopted the underlying transportation measure .
     But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 3.1 billion</NUMEX> in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs .
     The additional spending pushes the measure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 billion</NUMEX> above its prescribed budget ceiling , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The separate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 67 billion</NUMEX> bill sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> had budget difficulties , too , but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> itself .
     No single bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and , apart from the space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">station</ENAMEX> , the measure incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
     The current ceiling on home loans insured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> is increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 124,875</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     And in anticipation of increased lending , the cap on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> loan guarantees would rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $ 73.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     Separately , the bill gives authority to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> under the so-called Section 235 home-ownership program for lower-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     This provision met early and strong resistance from investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> worried about disruptions in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ' portfolios .
     But the promise of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 15 million</NUMEX> in new savings helped to forge a partnership between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> wanting to protect their projects elsewhere .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">The estimated $ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> for the space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">station</ENAMEX> would be double <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's level , and total appropriations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> would grow <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 12.4 billion</NUMEX> .
     A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits .
     And while imposing a statutory cap of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> on future spending , the bill would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe .
     Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Science Foundation</ENAMEX> is promised a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 %</NUMEX> increase to bring its appropriations to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.07 billion</NUMEX> .
     And while pursuing these initiatives , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> are squeezed too by steady increases -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 551 million</NUMEX> -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> 's medical care .
     The result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs , and the commitments now will drive excess spending into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> .
     Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills , yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated with their own summit agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past spring</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's hard to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's attention on anything , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Frenzel</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minn.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , `` because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry . ''
     Among the subsidies continued in the transportation bill is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30.7 million</NUMEX> to maintain commercial air service for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> , often in rural areas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">W.Va .</ENAMEX> -RRB- strongly resisted deeper cuts sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     But at a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> wants to kill the entire program , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> have been among its leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> , used his influence to preserve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 132,000</NUMEX> in subsidies for air service to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sante Fe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2.1 million</NUMEX> would go for service to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virginia Smith</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GP Express</ENAMEX> , an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> serving much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> , estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40 %</NUMEX> of its revenues come from the subsidies that , in some cases , exceed the cost of a ticket .
     For example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> can fly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chardon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 89 to $ 109</NUMEX> , according to prices quoted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But given the few number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> , the cost to the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> is estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 193</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> action <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> came as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> remained mired in difficulties over a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.25 billion</NUMEX> measure covering the budgets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> departments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     The compromise bill passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> but has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> , which jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> .
     The same jealousy can breed confusion , however , in the absence of any authorization bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appropriators</ENAMEX> sought to establish a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 30</TIMEX> deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed .
     But on a 53-45 roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Relations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claiborne Pell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">R.I .</ENAMEX> -RRB- complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than three decades</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> was the kind of story Wall Street loved .
     Since the value of its assets was n't known , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were free to pick a number .
     In one of many rosy scenarios , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Schneider</ENAMEX> wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> that its real estate alone had a value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> .
     Throw in its railroad , minerals , pipeline and oil assets , he and others argued , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> should be worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> a share .
     And why should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> expect to realize that presumed `` worth ? ''
     That was another reason the Street loved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> .
     With real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">experts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Zell</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Itel</ENAMEX> owning close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> 's stock , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly `` maximize values . ''
     But value , it turns out , is only what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> will pay .
     And with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate , the values suddenly look poorer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> interest in its real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Public Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 400 million</NUMEX> .
     Since the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> also includes debt , the imputed value of the real estate itself is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     `` The implied current net asset value of 22.70 -LCB- per share -RCB- is well below the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> level that the Street believed , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> says .
     `` The upside was in the intangible real estate ... which is no longer an intangible . ''
     So what is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> worth ?
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">railroad</ENAMEX> is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNW</ENAMEX> -- it would have a value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.65 billion</NUMEX> .
     A compromise between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bulls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> puts remaining assets and cash -- including its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> stake in its publicly traded pipeline -- at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> also has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.7 billion</NUMEX> in debt .
     In addition , its railroad lost a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> antitrust suit , which is on appeal , and which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say could be settled for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> that amount .
     That nets out to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 17</NUMEX> a share for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> on a private market basis .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> , currently trading at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 7\/8</NUMEX> , is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets , because the tax against it would be onerous .
     Its plan , instead , is to spin off the remainder of its real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Krebs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , argues that since its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are valued in different ways , `` the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole . ''
     But it is n't clear why that should be so .
     The spinoff argument , after all , reverses the current notion that assets are worth more to private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> than to public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     And real estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> says , `` We believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount ... after the realty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> is spun off ... .
     And what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ? ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> remain bullish .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schneider</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> says he is recalculating the worth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief that he will find `` values '' of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> a share .
     He adds : `` If for any reason I do n't have the values , then I wo n't recommend it . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graeme Anne Lidgerwood</ENAMEX> values <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> , down from her earlier estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> .
     Her recent report classifies the stock as a `` hold . ''
     But it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door .
     Quoting from the report : `` The stock 's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively unappealing investment at current prices , especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have been offered to others .
     In other words : The real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests .
     Since most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's real estate is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> where development is often held hostage to zoning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> .
     And , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zell</ENAMEX> says , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Itel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> '' to say the least .
     It is possible then that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> 's real estate -- even in a state imperiled by earthquakes -- could , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">one day</TIMEX> , fetch a king 's ransom .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Dunn</ENAMEX> notes , its properties will be developed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 to 20 years</TIMEX> .
     So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> could be in for a long wait .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Steel Co.</ENAMEX> is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products .
     The big questions are whether the increase , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1 , 1990</TIMEX> , will stick , and whether other major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> will follow suit .
     It is widely expected that they will .
     The increase is on the base price , which is already being discounted by virtually all steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> 's move marks the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> effort by a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> to counter the free fall in spot prices .
     Major steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> are selling cold rolled sheet steel at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 370</NUMEX> a ton , compared with a peak price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 520</NUMEX> a ton in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>-tier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are receiving even less per ton .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> 's planned increase , which was announced in an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 26</TIMEX> memo to district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> confirmed the price-increase plan , saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Steel</ENAMEX> , which is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Corp.</ENAMEX> , noted that steel prices , adjusted for inflation , increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.7 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988</TIMEX> , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly five</NUMEX> times as much .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is also trying to prevent further price drops .
     Moreover , they note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> may be trying to send a signal to major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whirlpool Corp.</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> need more money .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are in the process of negotiating contracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> and others .
     `` They -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> -RCB- may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Marcus</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX> believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1990</TIMEX> and then reverse themselves .
     He is n't convinced , though , that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong .
     And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> such as steel service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers</ENAMEX> are continuing to reduce inventories through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> , they eventually will begin stocking up again , he notes .
     It wo n't be clear for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> whether the price increase will stick .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Steelmakers</ENAMEX> announced a round of base-price increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , but began offering sizable discounts over the summer .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> to publicly boost discounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel .
     In composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> common shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bioengineers</ENAMEX> set out to duplicate that feat -- scientifically and commercially -- with new life forms .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1953</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watson</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> unlocked the double helix of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">deoxyribonucleic acid</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the genetic key to heredity .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Twenty years later</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Cohen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Boyer</ENAMEX> , made `` recombinant '' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> , transplanting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad</ENAMEX> 's gene into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> , which then reproduced toad genes .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Swanson</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">M.I.T.</ENAMEX>-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist-turned-entrepreneur</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , they saw dollar signs .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> apiece and an injection of outside capital , they formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Genentech Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Commercial gene-splicing was born .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Genentech</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> product , a brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">somatostatin</ENAMEX> , proved its technology .
     The next to be cloned , human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">insulin</ENAMEX> , had market potential and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Genentech</ENAMEX> licensed it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly</ENAMEX> , which produced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">insulin</ENAMEX> used by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> .

     At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Genentech</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only one profitable year</TIMEX> behind it -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a modest $ 116,000</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> -RRB- and no product of its own on the market .
     Nonetheless , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million</NUMEX> issue they floated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> opened at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35</NUMEX> and leaped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 89</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> .
     The trip from the test tube was not without snags .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> , for instance , both still university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Patent Office</ENAMEX> refused to grant it .
     That judgment , in turn , was reversed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> holding the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> patents for making recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> -LRB- now assigned to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Gene-splicing now is an integral part of the drug business .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> want the tax provision to be a separate bill , subject to the usual procedural obstacles .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , want to try to protect the measure by combining it with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> politically popular issues that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> could find hard to block .
     The talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , are expected to resume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Last night , after meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> proposed streamlining the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> deficit-reduction bill , now stalled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> , and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments .
     Under this plan , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> provisions currently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version of the deficit-cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic-illness insurance program and a controversial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans -- would be made into a separate bill .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> would try to attach a capital-gains provision to that legislation , hoping the political popularity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">its other two</NUMEX> parts would dissuade <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> from blocking it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> is confident he has sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions .
     Both plans would drop child-care provisions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill .
     While that could make it vulnerable to a veto by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> argue that a presidential rejection would give their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> a valuable issue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> 's congressional elections .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are to meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> proposal .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> seemed weary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> procedural hurdles .
     Pushing the issue on legislation needed to avoid default by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> , `` does n't seem to be very good strategy to me . ''

     With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> alike said the market 's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage .
     Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading , designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index futures .

     Under attack by its own listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and powerful floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is considering reinstituting a `` collar '' on program trading that it abandoned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> also may step up its disclosure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> engaged in program trading , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would n't comment publicly .
     But in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a `` national problem , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> said , `` We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term '' to help the situation .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> has been viewed by many exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades .
     He said he is `` very surprised '' by the furor over program trading and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's role in it that has raged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has been trying to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely , as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> want , would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have been under seige from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's own floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point tumble on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> has n't been making public remarks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue .
     What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is considering is re-establishing a `` collar '' on program trading when the market moves significantly .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Early last year</TIMEX> , after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>-point , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> instituted the collar , which banned program trading through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's computers whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> moved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> points up or down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> .
     It did n't work .
     `` The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions , '' meaning securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's electronic trading system , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said .
     That was when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> took a new tack by publishing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> statistics listing the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> emphasized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> reports on program trading to cover specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days</TIMEX> or even <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of heavy program trading and who was doing it .
     Meanwhile , another big Wall Street brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> joined others that have been pulling back from program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> unit said it ceased all index-arbitrage program trading for client accounts .
     In stock-index arbitrage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> , which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">11th</NUMEX>-biggest program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trader</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , had already suspended stock-index arbitrage for its own account .
     Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> unit , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>-biggest program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trader</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , is `` preparing a response '' to the program-trading outcry , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> is one of the few major Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that have n't pulled back from program trading in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> is an adroit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> who normally appears to be solidly in control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's factions .
     But he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's recent remarks that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , who make markets in individual stocks , and from many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have shares listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said that his predicting continued volatility is just `` how the world is .
     If bringing the message is a crime , I 'm guilty of it . ''
     But he said this does n't mean he is satisfied with the market 's big swings .
     `` We 're trying to take care of a heck of a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said .
     `` Each one has a different agenda . ''
     For example , in a special meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">some of</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> stock specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> complained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is no longer representing their interests .
     `` We are looking for representation we have n't had , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialist</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We 've had dictation . ''
     After another session Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> with major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of a top brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> said , `` Clearly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> want the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> to take leadership . ''
     Many specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> resent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's new `` basket '' product that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> to buy or sell all stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX> 's 500-stock index in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shot .
     Ultimately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> .
     `` His -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's -RCB- own interests are in building an electronic marketplace , '' said a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> .
     The basket product , while it has got off to a slow start , is being supported by some big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -- another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">member</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's splintered constituency .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> has had difficulty convincing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is serious about curbing volatility , especially as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> clearly relishes its role as the home for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> in stock-index funds , which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & Poor 's 500 , and which sometimes employ program trading .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets , but only as long as it `` handles it intelligently , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said .
     Despite what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are suggesting , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures , exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     Most revisions it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during stressful periods , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Computers have made trading more rapid , but that can be fixed with some fine-tuning .
     `` I think if you -LCB- can -RCB- speed things up , you can slow them down , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said .
     `` That 's different than wrecking them . ''
     While volatility wo n't go away , he said , `` Volatility is greater than program trading .
     What I 'm trying to say to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is , it 's proper to worry about program trading , but it 's only a piece of the business . ''
     For example , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said that big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market , regardless of index arbitrage .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would like to go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> , '' before program trading , he said .
     `` I would like to go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     But we 're not going back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> . ''
     Indeed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said that if stock-market volatility persists , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's markets are more stable , '' he said .
     `` If that continues , a significant number of -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> . -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will go over there to raise money . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming days</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> formulates its responses to the program-trading problem , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> may take a more public role in the issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis L. Glucksman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co.</ENAMEX> , said : `` This is a problem that 's taking on a life of its own .
     The program trading situation seems to have driven individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> as well as others out of the market , and even Europeans are suspicious .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> should take a pro-active position . ''
     For now , however , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said : `` I refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is hunky-dory .
     We have a major problem , and that problem is volatility . ''
