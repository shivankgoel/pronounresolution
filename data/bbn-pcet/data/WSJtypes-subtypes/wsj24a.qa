     The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
     The most troublesome report may be the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> merchandise trade deficit due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     The trade gap is expected to widen to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 9 billion</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.6 billion</NUMEX> , according to a survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS International</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's report on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> gain reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in the producer price index .
     That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's session , before it got started on its reckless <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> housing starts , due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , are thought to have inched upward .
     `` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Englund</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS</ENAMEX> .
     A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as stocks plummeted .
     In any event , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englund</ENAMEX> and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
     `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next six or seven months</TIMEX> as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
     Exports are thought to have risen strongly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> said .
     Views on manufacturing strength are split between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> who read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
     The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> to an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS</ENAMEX> .
     A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report .
     The consensus view expects a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> increase in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> CPI after a flat reading in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert H. Chandross</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level .
     `` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said .
     Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 4 %</NUMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Ciminero</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group</ENAMEX> .
     He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     He expects a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 0.5 %</NUMEX> in core inflation after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> of far smaller increases .
     Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> pace of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,350,000</NUMEX> units .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> say an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> rebound in permits for multifamily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">units</ENAMEX> signaled an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .

     Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> and trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months</TIMEX> may be seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's concept of both .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City</ENAMEX> '' is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> series that premiered here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three weeks ago</TIMEX> amid unprecedented hype by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thames Television</ENAMEX> .
     The early episodes make you long for a rerun of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">the crash of 1987</ENAMEX> .
     Let 's make that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> , just to be sure .
     According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City</ENAMEX> , '' set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman</ENAMEX> , a fictional mid-sized securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 500 million</NUMEX> capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close-knit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of young , high-flying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .
     But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another million</NUMEX> before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a fraction of a second</TIMEX> ... ''
     You need n't be a high-powered securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
     The slickly produced series has been criticized by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognoscenti</ENAMEX> as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> ' professional and private lives .
     Turned loose in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman</ENAMEX> 's trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room</ENAMEX> , the yuppie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> do little right .
     Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman</ENAMEX> 's capital should be just about exhausted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the final 13th week</TIMEX> .
     In the opening episode we learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> , a junior bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , has indeed pulled off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another million</NUMEX> before lunch .
     Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
     Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> blabs about it to a sandwich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> while ordering lunch over the phone .
     Little chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman</ENAMEX> is going to recoup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> spend the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> trade figures will look lousy .
     Ah , perfidious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia</ENAMEX> !
     The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price .
     So much for anticipating the market by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a fraction of a second</TIMEX> .
     And a large slice of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> bonds -LRB- since when is anything <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> nearly worthless nowadays ? -RRB- .
     Surprisingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman</ENAMEX> survives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , only to have a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> innocently bumble his way into becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of a criminal insider trading investigation .
     Instead of closing ranks to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's reputation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> 's internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> , led by a loutish <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> , demand his resignation .
     The plot is thwarted when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholder</ENAMEX> , kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     But the investigation continues .
     If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> consume very conspicuously .
     In fact , few consume much of anything .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> share a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> almost devoid of furniture .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> lives in a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , and although she drives a canary-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Porsche</ENAMEX> , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock .
     And it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Declan</ENAMEX> , the obligatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> , until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> episode to get past <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> base with any of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prey</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free-enterprise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> .
     After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money</ENAMEX> .
     This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> , the trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room</ENAMEX> 's most flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> .
     Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> , wears designer clothes and drives an antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     But apparently to make him palatable , even lovable , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> , the script inflates pony-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> into an eccentric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> dialects .
     He takes his wash to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">laundromat</ENAMEX> , where he meets a punky <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who dupes him into providing a home for her pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">piranha</ENAMEX> and then promptly steals his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and dumps it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dieppe</ENAMEX> .
     In producing and promoting `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thames</ENAMEX> has spent about as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shane Longman</ENAMEX> loses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good day</TIMEX> .
     The production costs are a not inconsiderable <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 8 million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.4 million</NUMEX> -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">set</ENAMEX> been absorbed in the budget of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dealers</ENAMEX> , '' an earlier made-for-TV movie .
     Another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half million quid</NUMEX> went for a volley of full-page advertisements in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> and for huge posters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">subway</ENAMEX> .
     These expenses create a special incentive for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City 's</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to flog it , or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Yank</ENAMEX>-oriented version of it , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thames</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Taffner</ENAMEX> , is preparing to do just that .
     He is discreetly hopeful , citing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> comedy series -- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Three 's Company</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Too Close for Comfort</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Check It Out</ENAMEX> '' -- that had <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> antecedents .
     Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taffner</ENAMEX> simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Capital City</ENAMEX> '' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Carry On</ENAMEX> '' movies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds</ENAMEX> already are in the script .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading-room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> minded a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casualty</ENAMEX> of a broken marriage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     And many in the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> bear striking resemblances to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> TV and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> known for light roles .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanna Kanska</ENAMEX> looks like a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Zsa Gabor</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Armstrong </ENAMEX>, who plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max </ENAMEX>, could pass for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Conreid</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Hodge</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Declan</ENAMEX> -RRB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Farentino</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolf Saxon</ENAMEX> is a passable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Noonan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian Healy</ENAMEX> could easily double for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huntz Hall</ENAMEX> , the blank-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bowery Boys</ENAMEX> comedies .
     So , OK <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> , everybody on stage for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Carry On Trading</ENAMEX> '' : The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> is frantically searching the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">office</ENAMEX> for misplaced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> bonds that suddenly have soared in value because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank</ENAMEX> has just bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> .
     The pressure is too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Zsa</ENAMEX> , who slaps a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> .
     He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which explodes , covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huntz Hall</ENAMEX> 's face with microchips .
     And all the while , the bonds are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> 's diaper .
     It should run forever .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa-Midi Assurances</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> gave details of its financing plans for its proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , in amended filings with insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> operates .
     The proposed acquisition is part of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> 's unfriendly takeover attempt for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> .
     In an attempt to appease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> ' concern over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> if he is successful in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T .</ENAMEX>
     As part of the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> agreed to invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> 's acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vehicle</ENAMEX> .
     Of the total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 billion</NUMEX> to be paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</NUMEX> will come from available resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa-Midi Group</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.25 billion</NUMEX> will be in the form of notes issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> , and the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.25 billion</NUMEX> will be in long-term bank loans .
     In an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bebear</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> , said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> has already obtained assurances from a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere de Paribas</ENAMEX> that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
     The other banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in the group are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Lyonnais</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Societe Generale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> , he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa-Midi Group</ENAMEX> has `` <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
     He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and a real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , and would n't include any pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> .
     `` We wo n't put any burden on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has an absolute obligation to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> upon an acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T .</ENAMEX>
     `` We hope that with what we did , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> will not need to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> wo n't be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> at anytime , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said .
     Any change of control in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> needs approval of the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Farmers</ENAMEX> and its related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are incorporated .
     The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> , and to reflect the extension that Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .

     Dismal sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> dragged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> car and truck market down below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sales period of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> model year .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> major domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160,510</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first 10 days of October</TIMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.6 %</NUMEX> drop from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Domestically built truck sales were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86,555</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">pickups</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> and sport utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .
     The heavy use of incentives to clear out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> model sales , which began officially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> .
     This appears particularly true at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , which had strong sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> but saw its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> car and truck results fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.3 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's unusually high level .
     Overall , sales of all domestic-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.9 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , overall sales for the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">automakers</ENAMEX> were roughly flat with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> results .
     Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> have already adopted incentives on many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .
     `` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kelly </ENAMEX>, sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bill Wink Chevrolet</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dearborn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich .</ENAMEX>
     Car sales fell to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonally</TIMEX> adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> selling rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> , the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> .
     The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost eight million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     Furthermore , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> contacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's steep market decline .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's domestic car sales dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.3 %</NUMEX> and its domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> were down an even steeper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.7 %</NUMEX> from the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> showed big declines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2 %</NUMEX> increase despite new competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> , the fledging luxury-car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> sales were n't available ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> are imported and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> reports their sales only at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month-end</TIMEX> .
     The sales drop for the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> may have been caused in part by the end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> of dealer incentives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing , a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> had a different program in place that continued rewarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> until all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> had been sold .
     Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> posted generally mixed results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> drop in domestic car sales but a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> increase in domestic truck sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 %</NUMEX> drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all year</TIMEX> .
     However , sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minivans</ENAMEX> , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's sales of domestically built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.7 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Marysville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , was gearing up to build <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Accords</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said firm prices on its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX>-model domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minivans</ENAMEX> will rise an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> over comparably equipped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> .
     Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this fall</TIMEX> .
     At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 4 % and 9 %</NUMEX> on most vehicle .
     a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
     c - Domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX>

     It was n't so long ago that a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> -- and originally by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency </ENAMEX>-- was accused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> here of employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">propagandists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imperialists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> .
     Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> has opened a news bureau in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Szabad Europa Radio</ENAMEX> '' -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnabas de Bueky</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55-year-old</TIMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> who works in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Munich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">headquarters</ENAMEX> as deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> .

     But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> 's life in more ways than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> is in danger of suffering from its success .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> currently can operate freely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest</ENAMEX> , so can others .
     In addition , competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .
     Instead of being denounced as an evil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent</ENAMEX> of imperialism , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring .
     `` They have a lot to do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days</TIMEX> to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> radio , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Deak</ENAMEX> , a computer-science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Technical University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest</ENAMEX> .

     The establishment of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureau</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> territory shows the depth of some of the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .

     It proved a perfect time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> to ask for permission to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     Not only did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> 's new location , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Telecommunications</ENAMEX> did something even more amazing : `` They found us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phone lines in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geza Szocs</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> who helped organize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest</ENAMEX> location .

     Proposals for government-operated `` national service , '' like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .
     The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of national service .

     It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> .
     Why does the national-service <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> keep coming back ?
     Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .
     If only we could get <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's wastrel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A quarter of a century ago</TIMEX> national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft .
     Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> that an obligation of government service for all young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is still the true long-term aim of many national-service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .
     Choice of the volunteer military in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> was kept alive in sociology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">departments</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> , when it again was let loose .
     This time it attempted to invade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> of educational grants and loans .
     Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> reasoned , but require some form of service from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> ?
     Military service , moreover , could be a national-service option .
     Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> , pay-as-you-go <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> , and idealistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Democratic Leadership Council</ENAMEX> , a centrist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> to attract support , especially among college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> .
     A provision allowing grants to be applied to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">DLC</ENAMEX> plan envisaged `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> '' planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> , emptying bedpans , tutoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , and assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> a week , tax free , plus medical care .
     With a tax-free <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> voucher payment at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of each year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> would be making a wage comparable to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17,500</NUMEX> a year .
     Mind you , most of `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> '' would be unskilled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">17 - to 18-year-olds</TIMEX> , some not even high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> , and many saving money by living at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> .
     They would be doing better financially under national service than many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees</ENAMEX> decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . ''
     Opposition to national service from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped .
     Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up .
     What better place to turn than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Committee</ENAMEX> , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">porridge</ENAMEX> is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cuisine</ENAMEX> ?
     In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">DLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a competitive grants program to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> specialty -RRB- , a community service work-study program for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> -LRB- pleasing to the palate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">VISTA</ENAMEX> volunteer program and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Retired Senior Volunteer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Foster Grandparent</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Senior Companion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">programs</ENAMEX> .
     Before the menu is printed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 330 million</NUMEX> .
     It is widely known that `` too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> spoil the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">broth</ENAMEX> , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> , especially if they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> .
     The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs</ENAMEX> are happy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">restaurant</ENAMEX> is pushing the dish very hard .
     The aroma of patronage is in the air .
     Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?
     On the contrary , it is as robust as ever .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Gallup Poll</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> contribute an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- .
     Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> does see various `` unmet needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them .
     If we want to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , we might adopt the idea used in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's idea of `` service . ''
     Or we might provide a tax credit for working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI Bill</ENAMEX> .
     To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> as short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and cause resentment among permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .
     Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?
     Not necessarily .
     Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .
     Nonetheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are organizing a roll of supporting `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">associations</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">societies</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">councils</ENAMEX> , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> . ''
     So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Points of Light</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundation</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism .
     However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> gives in to congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> pressure to add to the scope of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's initiative or to involve the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundation</ENAMEX> in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
     There 's no need for such concessions .
     The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .
     National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</NUMEX> of knee-socked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> performing works of `` civic content '' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> .

     At least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this spring</TIMEX> .

     An omnibus bill assembled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and including some diluted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurdy</ENAMEX> provisions along with proposals by fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claiborne Pell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Mikulski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Dodd </ENAMEX>, has been reported out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Labor Committee</ENAMEX> .
     It might well win <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> passage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has outlined his own Youth Entering Service -LRB- YES -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified .
     What is one to think of all this ?
     Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> eager to have youth `` pay their dues to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones .
     So do those who seek a `` re-energized concept of citizenship , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights .
     Then there are instinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> .
     To <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Devotees</ENAMEX> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform :
     If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX> of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations .
     But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ?
     How should we think about national service ?
     Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning .
     Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?
     Short or long ?
     Part-time or full-time ?
     Paid or unpaid ?
     Would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> live at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> and work nearby or live in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">barracks</ENAMEX> and work on public lands ?
     What kinds of work would they do ?
     What does `` national '' mean ?
     Would the program be run by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> , or by private voluntary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> ?
     And who would serve ?
     Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> , as with the draft , or both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX> ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Youth</ENAMEX> only or all ages ?
     Middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , or poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , or a genuine cross-section ?
     Many or few ?
     Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them .
     Then how should we think about national service ?
     As a starting point , here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> propositions : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Consider the ingredients , not the name .
     Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .
     They will differ in crucial ways .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . `` Service '' should be service .
     As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice .
     It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career .
     It follows that proposals like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurdy</ENAMEX> , whose benefits to enrollees are worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 17,500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> , do not qualify .
     There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> amount to `` a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI Bill</ENAMEX> without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .
     But the earnings exceed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> the average income of young high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> with full-time jobs .
     Why call that service ?
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .
     Compelled service is unconstitutional .
     It is also unwise and unenforceable .
     -LRB- Who will throw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> each year ? -RRB-
     But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
     It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .
     Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . Good programs are not cheap .
     Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> tutored , day-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">centers</ENAMEX> staffed .
     There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> have shown that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply .
     Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality .
     They involve stipends to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> .
     Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> .
     Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 10,000</NUMEX> a year .
     Are they worth that ?
     Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> are counted .
     But the calculations are challengeable .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> . Underclass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> are a special concern .
     Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ?
     Yes , if targeted .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> , and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> , to serve at little public cost .
     They can volunteer at any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> , or participate in service programs required by high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> or encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> .
     Underclass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> do n't have those opportunities .
     They are not enrolled in high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> .
     They are unlikely to be employed .
     And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .
     But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .
     Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .
     But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .
     Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them .
     Even if it is cheaper to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">playgrounds</ENAMEX> or paint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments</ENAMEX> or plant dune-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> with paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> , the effects on the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> providing those services alter the calculation .
     Strictly speaking , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> are not performing service .
     They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .
     But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .
     That is a service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .

     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> here and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> laid plans through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> to head off a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> was on the telephones , making it clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .
     And at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> talked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> on Wall Street while Assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mullins</ENAMEX> carefully analyzed data on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> market plunge .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> would give them more strength and flexibility should <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market drop turn into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> 's rout .
     `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , insisting on anonymity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> , when both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> carried stories quoting a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> saying the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> was prepared to pour cash into the banking system <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment .
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> 's game plan .
     It is prepared to assume the same role it played in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     The reticence of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> was evident in the appearance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> of Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">This Week</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> and others have been in close contact .
     I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said .
     When it was suggested his comment was a `` non-answer , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> replied : `` It is a non-answer .
     But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . ''
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said .
     `` The economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''
     But administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> conceded that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's drop carried the chance of further declines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , who also asked that he not be named .
     `` The other is that we see another major disaster , like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     I think that 's less likely . ''
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Johnson</ENAMEX> were in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world .
     The action was expected to begin with the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> foreign exchange markets at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 p.m. EST</TIMEX> -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the trading day</TIMEX> began later in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and through early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> planned to keep market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms</ENAMEX> operating throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> to monitor the developments .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , share prices dropped sharply by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> trading .
     After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early afternoon</TIMEX> was headed lower .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , the lead is being taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Undersecretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Glauber</ENAMEX> and Assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> worked together on the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Commission</ENAMEX> , headed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> , which was established after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash to examine the market 's collapse .
     As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when the stock market 's decline began .
     He was quickly on the phone with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins</ENAMEX> , who in turn was talking with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairmen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Later , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> phoned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and overseas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Aides</ENAMEX> say he continued to work the phones through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> .
     Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was briefed throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> , even after leaving for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Camp David </ENAMEX>.
     He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boskin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">counsel</ENAMEX> of economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> .
     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> tried throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> to render a business-as-usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Undersecretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mulford</ENAMEX> , for instance , was at a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hot Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , when the stock market fell , and remained there through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the following day</TIMEX> .
     And as of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> had n't canceled his plans to address the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bankers Association</ENAMEX> convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m. this morning</TIMEX> .
     Ironically , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> was scheduled to address the same convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 20 , 1987</TIMEX> .
     He flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> , when the market plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX> points , but then turned around the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">next morning</TIMEX> and returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> without delivering his speech .

     Put down that phone .
     Walk around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> ; take two deep breaths .
     Resist the urge to call your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> and sell all your stocks .
     That 's the advice of most investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     No one can say for sure what will happen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next six months</TIMEX> .
     But they 're nearly unanimous on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point : Do n't sell into a panic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> who sold everything after the crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> lived to regret it .
     Even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</NUMEX> above where it landed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">crash of 1929</ENAMEX> was followed by a substantial recovery before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">great Depression</ENAMEX> and awful bear market of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> began .
     The `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> massacres '' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns .
     Indeed , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this week</TIMEX> , as a chance for bargain hunting .
     `` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B. Timbers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services Inc .</ENAMEX>
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> think the immediate course for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should be to stand pat .
     `` When you see a runaway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Janachowski</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> investment advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brouwer &amp; Janachowski</ENAMEX> , `` you wait for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train</ENAMEX> to stop . ''
     Even for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who expect a bear market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months</TIMEX> -- and a sizable number of money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> do -- the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies .
     The best thing individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> can do is `` just sit tight , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall B. Front</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of investment counseling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stein Roe &amp; Farnham Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based investment counseling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 18 billion</NUMEX> .
     On the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Front</ENAMEX> says , it would be misguided to sell into `` a classic panic . ''
     On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy .
     `` This is all emotion right now , and when emotion starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said .
     `` So it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ibbotson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the market information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ibbotson Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> , says , `` My real advice would be to just ride through it .
     Generally , it is n't wise to be in and out '' of the stock market .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibbotson</ENAMEX> thinks that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> is `` going to be a roller-coaster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week</TIMEX> . ''
     But he also thinks it is `` a good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week</TIMEX> to consider buying . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Snyder</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">chapter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Investors Corp.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clubs</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , says his fellow club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> did n't sell in the crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , and see no reason to sell <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     `` We 're dedicated long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     `` We understand panics and euphoria .
     And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge . ''
     One camp of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> sees what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as an opportunity .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> , they say , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should look for stocks to buy .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's action `` was an old-fashioned panic , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Goldman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of technical market analysis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> .
     `` Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . ''
     His advice : `` You ought to be there with a basket catching them . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Craig</ENAMEX> , portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Janus Fund</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge .
     Stocks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hershey Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American International Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says .
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> expects to pick up more shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     `` It will be chaotic at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , '' he says .
     He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall of 1987</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Front</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stein Roe</ENAMEX> suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction . ''
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> favors selected computer , drug and pollution-control stocks .
     Other investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> are more pessimistic .
     They say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away .
     Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rallying .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Fleckenstein</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline .
     He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 6 %</NUMEX> , far higher than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suppose .
     In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleckenstein</ENAMEX> has raised cash positions and invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge .
     He thinks government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are terrified to let a recession start when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , corporate and personal debt levels are so high .
     So he thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will err on the side of rekindled inflation .
     As a result , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleckenstein</ENAMEX> says , `` I think the ball game 's over , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are about to face a bear market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David M. Jones</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , recommends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities -LRB- of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">up to five years</TIMEX> ' maturity -RRB- .
     He says the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 6</TIMEX> employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index .
     A put option gives its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires .
     Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option .
     The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis .
     Thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk .
     The prices of puts generally did n't soar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> moved up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.3 %</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's close , even though the shares dropped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5.50</NUMEX> .
     But put-option prices may zoom when trading resumes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     It 's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> return for stock holdings , long-term , is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % to 10 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> ; a return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> is considered praiseworthy .
     Paying , say , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coldwell Banker Commercial Group</ENAMEX> said it sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 million</NUMEX> of common stock to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> a share , giving them a total stake of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</NUMEX> in the commercial real estate brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .

     He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> usually borrows money from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> to buy stock that it sets aside to award <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> over time , here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had to fork out their own cash for the stock .
     `` They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Didion</ENAMEX> said .
     `` It 's totally different . ''

     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major event <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock and futures trading may be a pause at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Under a reform arising from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , trading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> 's stock-index futures will break for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> if the contract opens and stays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> points from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's close , a move equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> .
     That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early-morning</TIMEX> breather is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a number of safeguards adopted after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .
     Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge .
     But the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be evaluated .
     A deeper market plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> could give them their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> test .
     A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash .
     Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Task Force</ENAMEX> , which analyzed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , would be revived -- especially because that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> .
     The most controversial of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> recommendations involved establishing a single overarching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .
     But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> said the circuit breakers worked as intended .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> expressed satisfaction with the results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> limits imposed on of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Those pauses -- <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later</TIMEX> -- forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
     During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> halt , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> index had fallen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sidecar</ENAMEX> '' computer program automatically was triggered .
     That system is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> compared the action in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> pit during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> freezes to a fire at a well-drilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     `` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Dubnow</ENAMEX> , an independent floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> .
     `` There was no panic .
     The system worked the way we devised it to work . ''
     After reopening for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 minutes</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> index tumbled to its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-point limit and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> freeze went into effect .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> then spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half-hour</TIMEX> `` watching to see if the Dow would drop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> points , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubnow</ENAMEX> added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 % to 90 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> `` were just standing around watching . ''
     But the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>-point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major indexes used by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to run their computerized trading strategies .
     The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year later</TIMEX> with a series of rather technical adjustments .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> , just after the market drop , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> time to pause and reconsider positions .
     In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets .
     Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .
     At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> .
     There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Sporkin</ENAMEX> , for example , likened to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barnacles</ENAMEX> attached to the basic market . ''
     And there was much criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 's system of having stock trades flow through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , or market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Task Force</ENAMEX> 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1988</TIMEX> , it immediately reshaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> ' agenda .
     Arguing that the separate financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketplaces</ENAMEX> acted as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">task force</ENAMEX> called for establishing a super-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulator</ENAMEX> to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .
     Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> held the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> recommendations at arm 's length and named a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Working Group on the Financial Markets</ENAMEX> -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Working Group</ENAMEX> , made up of representatives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several more months</TIMEX> of arguments among various stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     Privately , some free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketeers</ENAMEX> dismissed such mechanisms as sops to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> .
     After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</NUMEX> points once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">this century</TIMEX> .
     `` Circuit breakers '' set to soften big drops :
     -- If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> points at opening , contract trading pauses for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> .
     -- If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Industrials</ENAMEX> fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> points at opening , contract trading pauses for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> .
     -- If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points -LRB- equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</TIMEX> to that price or higher .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NYSE</ENAMEX> program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .
     -- If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> points , trading is restricted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> to that price or higher .
     -- If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Industrials</ENAMEX> fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> points , trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> halts for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI</ENAMEX> contracts also halt .
     -- If DJIA drops <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> points , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> halts trading for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> .
     Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures also halted .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Brady Task Force</ENAMEX> recommendations -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1988</TIMEX> -RRB- :

     Congressional proposal :

     Breaking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's television monopoly , an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has gained rights to show world programming , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> films .
     `` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai I.

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is already working on its own programming in several provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> and hopes to be on the air regularly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> said .

     Even though it will be independent of official television , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nika</ENAMEX> will have an oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> that will include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">league</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Union of Mineworkers</ENAMEX> said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamond</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> struck for higher wages at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</ENAMEX>

     The deadlock in negotiations occurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> offering a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> increase in the minimum-wage category while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> demanded a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.6 %</NUMEX> increase in the minimum wage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> denied that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> had been bribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">pinball-parlor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> .
     The allegation had been raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> by the governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Liberal Democratic Party</ENAMEX> following magazine reports suggesting that money from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pinball</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pachinko</ENAMEX> , had infiltrated politics .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsuruo Yamaguchi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> , acknowledged that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> had received donations from the pachinko <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8 million yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 55,000</NUMEX> -RRB- but said the donations were legal and none of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">members</ENAMEX> acted to favor the industry .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Wide Fund for Nature</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia</ENAMEX> were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders .
     A report by the conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> presented at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX>-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lausanne</ENAMEX> accused the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of trading protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> .
     Fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Lyster</ENAMEX> said world trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX> was estimated to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> of business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NATO</ENAMEX> project to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">frigate</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s</TIMEX> was torpedoed by the pull-out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> participating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> pointed to growing reluctance among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success .
     Small wonder that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor Party</ENAMEX> wants credit controls .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few hours</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> launched its own affinity credit card <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Tories</ENAMEX> raised the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's base interest rate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card is believed to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> linked to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor</ENAMEX> gets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 cents</NUMEX> -RRB- for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 155</NUMEX> -RRB- that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> charges to the card .
     As with other plastic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's high-interest-rate environment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor</ENAMEX> card , administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Co-operative Bank </ENAMEX>, carries a stiff -LRB- in this case , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.8 %</NUMEX> -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate on the unpaid balance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year-long</TIMEX> austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .
     The official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">China Daily</ENAMEX> said retail prices of non-staple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">foods</ENAMEX> have n't risen since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December</TIMEX> but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Statistical Bureau</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 1 billion yuan</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 270 million</NUMEX> -RRB- was spent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the year</TIMEX> for pork subsidies .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">newspaper</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . ''
     The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.7 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> now predict the growth rate will be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 11.5 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Russian Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> were allowed to celebrate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">400th</NUMEX> anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> patriarchate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Kremlin</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Uspensky Cathedral</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czars</ENAMEX> were crowned ... .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">34-foot</NUMEX>-tall , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.7 million</NUMEX> statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> was completed on a hill outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , facing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     The statue is the brainchild of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sik Chi Wan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Po Lin Monastery</ENAMEX> , who said : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is such a prosperous place , we also need some kind of religious symbol .

     It all seemed innocent enough : <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last April</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven B. Iken</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin Products Inc.</ENAMEX> here , identified himself as a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and got the word on the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's new cassette players for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     `` It is almost identical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> product , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iken</ENAMEX> remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures .
     Replied a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> : `` Exactly . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> merchandise carried wholesale prices some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> below those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My First Sony</ENAMEX> '' line .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> waxed enthusiastic and promised to return .
     But instead of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> -- part of a hoped-for bonanza from underselling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> got a costly legal morass .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iken </ENAMEX>, it turned out , was a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> .
     His recording later turned up as a court exhibit .
     Seeking to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My Own</ENAMEX> '' product line off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May</TIMEX> filed a suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> accusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">upstart</ENAMEX> of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law .
     Since then , life has changed a lot for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">61-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Kaye</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> .
     `` I have n't been able to get a decent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says .
     `` It 's the most distracting thing in my life -- I ca n't even attend to my business . ''
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million</NUMEX> -RRB- may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of total sales -- if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 16 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- prevails .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">multinational</ENAMEX> .
     With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has turned the tables on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look-alike products from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> , whose innovative , premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> with a cheap look-alike produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     `` The gist of this is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> knocked off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> line and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> wants to stop it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis H. Eslinger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , who previously guarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Rubik 's Cube</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> itself declines to comment . -RRB-
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> wins , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eslinger</ENAMEX> says , its little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival</ENAMEX> will have to try to sell the products overseas .
     At worst , he adds , `` They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> in the marketplace .
     `` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John E.

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> turned down an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> returned with additional evidence and arguments .
     Though hoping to settle the case , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> vows to fight on , if necessary .
     But the battle is more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> bargained for .
     `` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye </ENAMEX>, who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> had sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capetronic Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , and retired , only to find he was bored .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mickey Mouse</ENAMEX> radios .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has grown -- to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> initially , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> has been profitable since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , adds the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , who shares his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys .
     Like many others , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> took notice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Walkman</ENAMEX> line of portable audio equipment and created the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My First Sony</ENAMEX> line for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .
     -LRB- In court papers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> says it has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 million</NUMEX> to promote the line , with resulting sales of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a million</NUMEX> units . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> found a new market niche , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor .
     His products are n't exact copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> , on the theory that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> prefer these colors .
     -LRB- `` To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire-engine red , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles E. Baxley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last winter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> was showing prototypes at toy fairs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> noticed .
     Indeed , concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> products -- against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baxley</ENAMEX> fired off a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     He himself threatened to take the matter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Justice Department</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which were without merit , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eslinger</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baxley</ENAMEX> : `` Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone .
     We never intended taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> -- we do n't have the resources . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> answered the empty threat with its real suit .
     Off and on since then , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have skirmished in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> , in a news release , says , `` Once competitive , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> now resorts to strong-arm tactics in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtrooms</ENAMEX> to carve out and protect niche markets . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> insists that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's tactics -- including the use of a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> posing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> -- are routine in such matters .
     He also insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">My First Sony</ENAMEX> products distinctive .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> long before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's market . -RRB-
     Whatever its merits , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's aggressive defense is debilitating for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Justin</ENAMEX> .
     It 's also costly .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> says he has paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 70,000</NUMEX> in legal fees so far .
     Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> says : `` They know there 's no way for them to lose .
     They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . ''
     For now , though , he vows to hang in .
