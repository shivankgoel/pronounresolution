     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> may want to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set .
     Couch-potato <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jocks</ENAMEX> watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> '' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> from among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> filmed replays .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two weeks ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> consumer segments started calling a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> number for advice on various life-style issues .
     And the new syndicated `` reality '' show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Hard Copy</ENAMEX> '' records <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> ' opinions for possible airing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next day</TIMEX> 's show .
     Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities .
     Eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost .
     But right now programmers are figuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned .
     `` We 've been spending a lot of time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> talking to TV production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Parks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Call Interactive</ENAMEX> , which supplied technology for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">consumer minutes</TIMEX> .
     `` With the competitiveness of the television market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days</TIMEX> , everyone is looking for a way to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> more excited . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leaders</ENAMEX> behind the expanded use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> numbers is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Call Interactive</ENAMEX> , a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> of giants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co .</ENAMEX>
     Formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> weds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> 's newly expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> service with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> voice-activated computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Omaha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center</ENAMEX> .
     Other long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> have also begun marketing enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> service , and special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> are springing up to exploit the new tool .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blair Entertainment</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that advises TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> and sells ads for them , has just formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">900 Blair</ENAMEX> -- to apply the technology to television .
     The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years</TIMEX> .
     For a while , high-cost pornography lines and services that tempt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to dial -LRB- and redial -RRB- movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses .
     The cost of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> call is set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">originator</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> , for example -- with the cheapest starting at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> .
     Billing is included in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> 's regular phone bill .
     From the fee , the local phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and the long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> extract their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">originator</ENAMEX> , which must cover advertising and other costs .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> , the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume .
     Before , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> numbers .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in the phone business call this technology `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> click . '' -RRB-
     Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want , and the hardware can process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> calls in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 seconds</TIMEX> .
     Up to now , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> numbers have mainly been used on local TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> and cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MTV</ENAMEX> used one to give away the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">house</ENAMEX> that rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Bon Jovi</ENAMEX> grew up in .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> has invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> to respond nightly to topical issues -LRB- `` Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> intervene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> ? '' -RRB- , but even the hottest controversies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> log <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 10,000</NUMEX> calls .
     The newest uses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX>-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger .
     The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> will be given a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> number to call .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Callers</ENAMEX> will be sent educational booklets , and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money .
     Other network applications have very different goals .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Sanger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> 's marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , says that now `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> call its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each week</TIMEX> to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc .
     Profit from the calls goes to charity , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC Sports</ENAMEX> also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> for voting , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gifford</ENAMEX> offers a football videotape for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.95</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> stay on the line to order it .
     Jackets may be sold next .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC Sports</ENAMEX> recently began `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scores Plus</ENAMEX> , '' a year-round , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said its purpose is `` to bolster the impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC Sports</ENAMEX> is always there for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> 's `` On-Line '' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">consumer minutes</TIMEX> have increased advertiser spending during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> 's weakest period .
     Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekday</TIMEX> matches a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor</ENAMEX> and a topic : On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Mondays</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever N.V.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Bros.</ENAMEX> sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Bros.</ENAMEX> commercial .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viewers</ENAMEX> can call a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch -LRB- `` Press <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> if you 're pregnant , '' etc . -RRB- .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor</ENAMEX> , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor</ENAMEX> will be able to gather a list of desirable potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Seaman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC-TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time .
     She would n't say what the premium is , but it 's believed to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</NUMEX> above regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daytime</TIMEX> rates .
     `` We were able to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a chance to do couponing , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seaman</ENAMEX> .
     `` And we were able to attract some new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> because this is something new . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Call Interactive</ENAMEX> says TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are considering the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> numbers for `` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> are predicting a big influx of new shows in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , when a service called `` automatic number information '' will become widely available .
     This service identifies each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> 's phone number , and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Hard Copy</ENAMEX> , '' the new syndicated tabloid show from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Pictures</ENAMEX> , will use its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> number for additional purposes that include research , says executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark B. von S. Monsky</ENAMEX> .
     `` For a piece on local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> , we can ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal , '' he says .
     `` That 'll save us time and get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsky</ENAMEX> sees much bigger changes ahead .
     `` These are just baby steps toward real interactive video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television , '' he says .
     Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions , TV programmers could let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> vote on different endings for a movie .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fox Broadcasting</ENAMEX> experimented with this concept <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Married ... With Children</ENAMEX> '' voted on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> should say `` I love you '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peg</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Valentine 's Day</TIMEX> .
     Someday , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> may also choose different depths of news coverage .
     `` A menu by phone could let you decide , ` I 'm interested in just the beginning of story No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , and I want story No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in depth , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsky</ENAMEX> says .
     `` You 'll start to see shows where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> program the program .

     A price was n't disclosed .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> did n't disclose the new estimate but said the change was related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> 's failure to sell its core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , as well as `` other events , '' which it did n't detail , that occurred after its announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> .

     The sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is viewed as a critical asset in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> 's attempt to sell its core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> cited concerns about how long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> would be able to hold together the sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason its talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> failed .

     The violent temblor , which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 seconds</TIMEX> and registered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> on the Richter scale , also caused the collapse of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">30-foot</NUMEX> section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> and shook <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> called for parliamentary elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> .
     The balloting , considered a test for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> and the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party</ENAMEX> , comes amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption .

     The report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> also rejected allegations that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> covered up evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waldheim</ENAMEX> 's activities as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> .

     The stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> continued to be pounded amid signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock plummeted a further <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 24.875</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 198</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.8 million</NUMEX> shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     The plunge followed a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56.875</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , amid indications the takeover may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> to be revived .
     The stock has fallen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87.25</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the three trading days</TIMEX> since announcement of the collapse of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-worst plunge ever .
     `` This is a total bloodbath '' for takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> , who put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> in play with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.4 billion</NUMEX> bid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     But he dropped his earlier <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share back-up bid , saying he must first explore bank financing .
     Even as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> in the buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , indicated it wants to start from scratch .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , who were to own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     Adding insult to injury , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , which helped scuttle financing for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bid , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> to resign .
     A similar demand was made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that represents some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</NUMEX> noncontract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Peterpaul</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> union general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , attacked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> as `` greedy and irresponsible '' for pursuing the buy-out .
     Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Pope</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , stood to pocket <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 114.3 million</NUMEX> for stock and options in the buy-out , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> planned to reinvest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 15 million</NUMEX> in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The blue-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> , longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> of the white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , say the buyout would load the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with debt and weaken its finances .
     Confusion about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> has n't even seen yet helped send <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock spiraling downward .
     And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> triggered a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 11:15 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's selling began after a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , which balked at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.65 billion</NUMEX> .
     Several reports as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> would sign up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> , for example , said only that it had `` expressions of interest of a transaction from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , '' but did n't have an agreement .
     Late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> issued a onepage statement calling Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterpaul</ENAMEX> 's blast `` divisive and uncalled for . ''
     But he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid , saying only , `` We are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership . ''
     Meanwhile , in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent , it was learned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> held a telephone meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to hear an update on the situation , but that a formal board meeting is n't likely to be convened until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next week</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> Lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> was quoted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times</ENAMEX> as declaring he is `` not prepared to take my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> into a hasty deal . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> said it appeared that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion , as well as by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' effort to round up financing for what one called `` a deal that is n't a deal . ''
     The effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-party buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were meeting outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> , which was to have supplied <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 965 million</NUMEX> in equity financing , apparently was n't involved in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> proposal and could well reject it even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> obtain financing .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's noncontract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said in a statement , `` The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were going to line their pockets with literally <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> is not only deplorable but inexcusable . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> also asked for an investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> , as well as in the response by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , just before the bank commitments were due , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Labor Department</ENAMEX> to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds .
     In his statement , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> said , `` We continue to believe our approach is sound , and that it is far better for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> than the alternative of having an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outsider</ENAMEX> own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> paying for it just the same . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , relying instead only on a takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Atkins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom</ENAMEX> .
     The huge drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock prompted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Kellner</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellner , DiLeo &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , to deny publicly rumors that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> was going out of business .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kellner</ENAMEX> said that despite losses on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock , his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's health is `` excellent . ''
     The stock 's decline also has left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> in a quandary .
     Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> if the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> ca n't revive its bid , it may have to explore alternatives if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> come back with a bid much lower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share proposal .
     At a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 1</TIMEX> to consider the labor-management bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> also was informed by its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">adviser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , of interest expressed by buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">funds</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Forstmann Little &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , as well as by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> 's buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were hoping that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the other interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> might re-emerge with the situation in disarray , or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> might consider a recapitalization .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> said they were still hesitant about accepting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's latest proposal .

     Right away you notice the following things about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Glass</ENAMEX> concert .
     It attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with funny hair -LRB- or with no hair -- in front of me a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> with spiked locks sat beside a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who had shaved his -RRB- .
     Whoever constitute the local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Left Bank</ENAMEX> come out in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> , dressed in black , along with a smattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> who want to be on the cutting edge .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> tend to look stoned .
     And , if still conscious at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> 's end , you notice something else : The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> , at first entranced and hypnotized by the music , releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude .
     Currently in the middle of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-week</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-city tour as a solo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> has left behind his synthesizers , equipment and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> in favor of going it alone .
     He sits down at the piano and plays .
     And plays .
     Either one likes it or one does n't .
     The typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> , which is more likely to be composed of music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> , certainly does .
     The work , though , sounds like Muzak for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">spaceships</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Glass</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> , and his music the new clothes , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> .
     His success is easy to understand .
     Softly introducing and explaining his pieces , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> looks and sounds more like a shaggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> describing his work than a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX> playing a recital .
     The piano compositions , which have been labeled variously as minimalist , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> , repetitive , cyclical , monophonic and hypnotic , are relentlessly tonal -LRB- therefore unthreatening -RRB- , unvaryingly rhythmic -LRB- therefore soporific -RRB- , and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic -LRB- therefore both pretty and unconventional -RRB- .
     It is music for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task .
     It is E-Z listening for the now generation .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> has inverted the famous modernist dictum `` less is more . ''
     His more is always less .
     Far from being minimalist , the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4\/4</NUMEX> time , octave intervals , and ragtime or gospel chord progressions .
     But the music has its charm , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Opening</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> -RRB- , from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Glassworks</ENAMEX> , introduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> technique : Never straying too far from the piano 's center , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> works in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> octaves on either side of middle C , and his fingers seldom leave the keys .
     There is a recognizable musical style here , but not a particular performance style .
     The music is not especially pianistic ; indeed , it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it .
     Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> .
     We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing .
     With `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Planet News</ENAMEX> , '' music meant to accompany readings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Ginsberg</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wichita Vortex Sutra</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> gets going .
     His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Seventh</NUMEX> chords make you feel as though he may break into a -LRB- very slow -RRB- improvisatory riff .
     The chords modulate , but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys .
     Contrasts predictably accumulate : <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> the music is loud , then it becomes soft , then -LRB- you realize -RRB- it becomes louder again .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">The Fourth Knee Play</ENAMEX> , '' an interlude from `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Einstein on the Beach</ENAMEX> , '' is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Three Blind Mice</ENAMEX> . ''
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand .
     He does this in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> of his solo pieces .
     You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment .
     In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Mad Rush</ENAMEX> , '' which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> charmingly , and tellingly , confessed that `` this was no problem for me '' -RRB- , an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved .
     Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended , it is also often multiple in its context -LRB- s -RRB- .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Mad Rush</ENAMEX> '' began its life as the accompaniment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama</ENAMEX> 's first public address in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> played it on the organ at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Cathedral of St. John the Divine</ENAMEX> .
     Later it was performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Bremen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> , and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucinda Childs</ENAMEX> took it for one of her dance pieces .
     The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The evening</TIMEX> ended with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Metamorphosis</ENAMEX> , '' another multiple work .
     Parts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> come from the soundtrack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Morris</ENAMEX> 's acclaimed film , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Thin Blue Line</ENAMEX> , '' and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other parts from incidental music to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate dramatizations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kafka</ENAMEX> story of the same name .
     When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-note phrase , a descending minor <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> film .
     Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Admirers</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> may agree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kostelanetz</ENAMEX> 's sense that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Music in Twelve Parts</ENAMEX> '' is as encyclopedic and weighty as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Well-Tempered Clavier</ENAMEX> . ''
     But while making the obvious point that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> develop variations from themes , this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> 's music .
     Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> yearn for the astringency of neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stravinsky</ENAMEX> , the genuinely radical minimalism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webern</ENAMEX> , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahler</ENAMEX> .

     A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell</ENAMEX> to include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamatake</ENAMEX> earnings in its results .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Defense and Marine Systems</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , resulting in lower operating profit for that business .

     Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions .
     In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S. Greve</ENAMEX> informs your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> , `` ... the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Water Act</ENAMEX> is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> discharge '' -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Congress's Environmental Buccaneers</ENAMEX> , '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 18</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Water Act</ENAMEX> contains no `` legal standard '' of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> discharge .
     It requires that `` discharges of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollutants</ENAMEX> '' into the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 301</ENAMEX> .
     Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> risk '' or `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> discharge . ''
     Perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greve</ENAMEX> was confused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 101</ENAMEX> , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , no less .
     This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute .
     Thus , you do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> a great disservice when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greve</ENAMEX> suggests , even facetiously , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Water Act</ENAMEX> prohibits the preparation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">scotch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> ; your tippling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> with their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">scotch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waters</ENAMEX> , from the hairyknuckled knock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> at their doors .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , is attracting more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> than ever and offers the glossy , high-toned pages that upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> love .
     So why did advertising pages plunge by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 10 %</NUMEX> and ad revenue by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> ?
     To hear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> tell it , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> just has n't kept up with the times .
     Despite renewed interest by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> like to flip through in search of topless tribe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     Worse , it lagged behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> in offering now-standard gimmicks , from regional editions to discounts for frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     But now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers</ENAMEX> do n't think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> first , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan McCraw</ENAMEX> , who joined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> as national advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     `` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . ''
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">101-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> has never had to woo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> with quite so much fervor before .
     It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.8 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> ; an average age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">42</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> -- at the height of their consuming years ; loyalty to the tune of an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> average subscription renewal rate .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> had its best year yet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , when it celebrated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial</TIMEX> and racked up a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> gain in ad pages , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">283</NUMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , when the hullabaloo surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial</TIMEX> died , so too did some advertiser interest .
     The reason , ad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market .
     Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130,000</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-color page , vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47,000</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> , a comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publication</ENAMEX> with a far smaller circulation .
     When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all .
     Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> offers far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> than does a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Glass</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bozell Inc .</ENAMEX>
     To combat that problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , like other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> , began offering regional editions allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> to appear in only a portion of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> -- for example , ads can run only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> in the largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> markets .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> was slower than its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> to come up with its regional editions , and until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> offered fewer of them than did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , for example , has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> separate editions going to different regions , top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> , and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> .
     Another sticking point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> do .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> 's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     But Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCraw</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> is fighting back .
     It now offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , and media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> just that .
     The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> will pour <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500,000</NUMEX> , mostly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few weeks</TIMEX> .
     The campaign , created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omnicom Group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> is known for .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ad , a photo of the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Sainte-Chapelle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . ''
     Another ad pictures a tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> , magnified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> times , with the headline , `` For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions . ''
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCraw</ENAMEX> says she wants the campaign to help attract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food .
     Her goal : to top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> ad pages in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 274</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain .
     `` The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> , '' she says .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> plans to restrict dual trading on commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> , a move almost certain to infuriate exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites `` problems '' associated with the practice .
     Dual trading gives an exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> the right to trade both for his own account and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     The issue exploded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     While not specifically mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' customer orders .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy Gramm</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Agriculture Committee</ENAMEX> that she expects the study to be released within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> and the rule changes to be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> .
     The study , by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> said .
     Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> said , `` does n't seem to have much economic impact . ''
     Currently , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> on commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , or for their own accounts as socalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> .
     `` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> operations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> average volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,000</NUMEX> contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill would force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> to suspend dual trading if an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .
     So far , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test of restricting dual trading has worked well .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Merc</ENAMEX> banned dual trading in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index futures <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pit</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Under the rules , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> who stand on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pit</ENAMEX> 's top step , where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pit</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's too soon to tell ... but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't seem to be unhappy with it , '' he said .
     He said he would n't comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> plan until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has seen the full proposal .
     But at a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Donovan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , told commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> : `` Dual trading is definitely worth saving .
     It adds something to the market .

     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> are negotiating looser terms , while others decline to deal at all .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> likes to insist that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> construct and furnish a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> style .
     Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">showroom</ENAMEX> and a tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> spanning a stream that flows into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> from outside .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> has it down to the ashtrays , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Ferron</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.D. Power &amp; Associates</ENAMEX> , an auto research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> also provides specifications .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two-thirds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> are constructing new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> specs .
     Some are even coming up with their own novel designs .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky.</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Peterson</ENAMEX> has built a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">showroom</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor .
     Yet some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> have turned down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchises</ENAMEX> because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Seidman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> -- without the stream .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> says he turned down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> in part because `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> was gorgeous but very expensive . ''
     To head off arguments , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> cash bonuses and low-interest construction loans .
     Dictation Device 's Saga Plays Back a Lesson
     PRODUCTS DON'T have to be <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be winners .
     That 's the lesson offered through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case study featured in a design exhibit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone Corp.</ENAMEX> was caught off guard in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> when its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lanier Office Products of Japan</ENAMEX> , introduced a microcassette dictation recorder <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the size of standard cassette devices .
     Blocked by patent protection from following suit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> again -- down to the length of a paperclip .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pitney Bowes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , had produced a working model of a `` picocassette '' recorder .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , however , the patent status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lanier</ENAMEX> microcassette had changed , permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> to develop its own competitive micro system , which it did .
     Marketing and sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">departments</ENAMEX> then urged abandonment of the pico project .
     But others said pico should proceed .
     Both were right .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> went ahead and introduced the pico in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , but it has n't sold well .
     To date , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emil Jachmann</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . ''
     Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways .
     It helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> attract better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> , and it provided new technology for other company products .
     The picocassette recorder also helped transform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's reputation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">follower</ENAMEX> to leading-edge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">innovator</ENAMEX> .
     `` It gave me great pride to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of the microcassette in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> look at the pico and shake his head and say ` unbelievable , ' '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jachmann</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> 's picocassette recorder is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> case studies in the TRIAD Design Project , sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Design Management Institute of Boston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Business School</ENAMEX> .

     A Rake 's Progress Means Branching Out
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ONE</NUMEX> DAY <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Barrett</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mobile</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ala.</ENAMEX> , was raking some sycamore <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> , but the rake kept riding up over the piles .
     The harder he tried to push them into large piles , the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back .
     So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alabama Steamship Association</ENAMEX> , took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about nine inches</NUMEX> up .
     His crude device worked : The lower teeth gathered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> into a pile , while the higher , harder teeth moved the top of the pile .
     Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake , the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">four-inch</NUMEX> prongs , or `` wonderbars , '' also are supposed to aid in picking up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Blaggs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mobile</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Barrett Rake</ENAMEX> allowed him to do his lawn in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2 hours</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> less than usual .
     But other rake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> have their doubts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mason</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ames Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Parkersburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">W.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stoner</ENAMEX> , marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">True Temper Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Black &amp; Decker</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't want to move a leaf pile .

     The ghosts of the past are everywhere : They are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget .

     During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Korean War</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas MacArthur</ENAMEX> demanded and got , in addition to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX> command in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> , his own naval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">command</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NavforJapan</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Command</ENAMEX> 's huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> is needed to analyze whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of coups against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War Powers Act</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> points , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Weinberger</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> points , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> points and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodrow Wilson</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> points necessary to justify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> support .
     So far no one has .
     The ghost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigade</ENAMEX> discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> back in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'70s</TIMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few hundred million</NUMEX> : the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caribbean Command</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Key West</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigade</ENAMEX> has n't been heard from since , but we keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> around just in case .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Marshall</ENAMEX> 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy .
     We keep a lot of shrines to him around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> : statues , busts , relics and such .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">deck</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">deck</ENAMEX> made them stop it .
     You see , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> had this thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marines</ENAMEX> -- he wanted to make them part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Forrestal</ENAMEX> blocked him .
     Now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done .
     To keep him quiet we invent a new unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">command</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every year</TIMEX> or so run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> and put more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marines</ENAMEX> under it .
     But we still hear him moaning at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> has a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> left , and to satisfy him the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> 's sea lift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were given to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , its space operations to another command in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frogmen</ENAMEX> to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Bragg</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
     Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> died , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> was so scared that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ayatollah</ENAMEX> that he declared the Carter Doctrine .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> .
     But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> -- lots .
     So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions</ENAMEX> and gave them to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Rapid Deployment Force</ENAMEX> .
     But that ghost was n't fooled ; he knew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RDF</ENAMEX> was neither rapid nor deployable nor a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> -- even though it cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 billion</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> a year .
     After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> was defeated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Weinberger</ENAMEX> .
     I saw what he did to them firsthand .
     It made my shoelaces dance with terror .
     Why , he used to lay in wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> ; suddenly he 'd leap from behind some statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> 's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 2 billion</NUMEX> or so .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> active and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reserve ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> ; a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> -- equivalent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marines</ENAMEX> ; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">C-5B</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">KC-10</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">C-17</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> tactical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> .
     He bought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> in prepositioning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ammo</ENAMEX> and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">base</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Diego Garcia</ENAMEX> in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> .
     He dedicated all these new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One night</TIMEX> both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> 's ghost and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> 's ghost together caught <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> and threw him to the ground .
     Before they let him go he added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RDF</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> and renamed it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Command</ENAMEX> .
     He gave those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> charge of all naval operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> figured it would be good training for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> -- someday maybe they would get the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> .
     They had fun moving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers</ENAMEX> around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> still kept leaping out at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> , so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> more and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion</NUMEX> of loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">barges</ENAMEX> , ramps , etc. , in order that those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigades</ENAMEX> could unload from all those new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> and go to war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Zagros mountains</ENAMEX> .
     Then suddenly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ike</ENAMEX> 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">12,000 miles</NUMEX> away ?
     We 'd get our asses kicked . ''
     Lucky for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ike</ENAMEX> was easygoing and soon went away , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> -- he kept coming back .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> found itself paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion</NUMEX> in baksheesh to various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">potentates</ENAMEX> for basing rights around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> .
     We had great success in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> .
     But then it turned out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siad Barrah</ENAMEX> was not at all a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">base</ENAMEX> he promised us in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera</ENAMEX> had silted up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about a hundred years ago</TIMEX> and anyway was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">1,244 miles</NUMEX> from the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- But who 's counting . -RRB-
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera</ENAMEX> was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrah</ENAMEX> .
     All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway .
     But would n't you know , now that we are spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">jillions of dollars</NUMEX> , and have built those new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions</ENAMEX> and new air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">wings</ENAMEX> , and have positioned all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> and supplies to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> seem to have lost interest in the whole subject .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget .
     Predictably , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> said : `` Do we still need to keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions</ENAMEX> on active duty and all those extra land-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">bases</ENAMEX> and all those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> playing admiral in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> ?
     Could n't we save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</NUMEX> a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ?
     And why not save the costs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> by abolishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Command</ENAMEX> and putting responsibility for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf</ENAMEX> naval operations back where it belongs , afloat with the task force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf</ENAMEX> ?
     And where were all our handsomely paid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">allies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> when our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">convoys</ENAMEX> were being attacked ? ''
     Questions like that really stir up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> 's ghost .
     He appeared <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late one night</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bedroom</ENAMEX> of the new defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> came clanking in like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marley</ENAMEX> 's ghost dragging those chains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">brigades</ENAMEX> and air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">wings</ENAMEX> and links with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">despots</ENAMEX> .
     He would n't leave until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> promised to do whatever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> systems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> told him .
     So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next day</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> went out and did just that : He canceled the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>-ship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> and cut back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carrier</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">frigates</ENAMEX> .
     Then he canceled production of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> 's most important carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-14</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">A-6</ENAMEX> .
     On the other hand , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> retained all those new land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> 's ghost is satisfied for now , but he 'll be back .
     What with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> are crawling under their desks .
     They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> .
     Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's hair white .
     Gives me the willies just thinking about it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , is a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> .

     The metal and marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobby</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust Bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> is grander than your average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loan</ENAMEX> .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , there is an old master on the wall -- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Samuel Anointing David</ENAMEX> , '' a big baroque canvas painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattia Preti</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Neapolitan</ENAMEX> .
     At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> and its flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David L. Paul</ENAMEX> .
     In an international buying spree that began barely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> amassed a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre-18th-century</TIMEX> works , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preti</ENAMEX> , at a total cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million</NUMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 6</TIMEX> , all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off , under orders from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;Ls</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> did n't meet the deadline .
     The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> and as decoration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> 's new office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> , designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX> .
     The rub is that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million</NUMEX> was plucked from the funds of this federally insured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> even as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> was losing money hand over fist .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> had no right to buy art for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place -- it is n't on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's `` permissible '' list -- without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do .
     Besides that , some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> actually ended up hanging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">estate</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">La Gorce Isle</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami Beach</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last spring</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> called a halt to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> 's fling , giving him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> to sell the paintings .
     The acquisitions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said in a letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> , were `` unsafe , unsound and unauthorized . ''
     So far , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> has unloaded but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of his masterpieces , he wo n't say to whom .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> says it is `` monitoring the situation . ''
     Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> could remove Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> , it has no current intention to do that .
     `` It 's not like selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevrolets</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> says , as he takes a drag on a goldbanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St. Moritz</ENAMEX> cigarette .
     `` The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">last six months</TIMEX> has established the quality of the collection .
     There 's no fire sale here . ''
     Despite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> 's characteristic hauteur , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">50-year-old</TIMEX> , chain-smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynamo</ENAMEX> is finding that getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's largest thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> -- out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been .
     Paintings are just part of the picture .
     Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> has pared a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.35 billion</NUMEX> junk-bond portfolio to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 900 million</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> , the high-yield debt market has plummeted .
     Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1994</TIMEX> under the new federal S&amp;L bailout law , may well prove difficult .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> has other problems .
     Late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> ordered the thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock -- a move that suggests deep concern about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> has a plan to bring in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> by selling off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> , but it has yet to be approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> .
     It is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> 's art venture , however , that has drawn the most attention from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> , not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">galleries</ENAMEX> throughout the world .
     Embittered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> -LRB- some of whom are suing -RRB- say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&amp;L crisis .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.125</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> to close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.875</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Gallery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors</ENAMEX> do n't say `` It 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> '' anymore , laments <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Brooks</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wildenstein &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery</ENAMEX> .
     `` They say , ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Payson</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53 million</NUMEX> for his , so certainly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> is n't too much for mine . '
     The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> we depended on , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Mellon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton Simon</ENAMEX> , have stopped buying , and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> are brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting ... . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payson</ENAMEX> , an art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> , sold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Irises</ENAMEX> '' at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> auction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1987</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Trouble is , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> has yet to pay up , and until he does , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has the painting under lock and key . -RRB-
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> moved in on the art market , he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> .
     He established his reputation as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freespender</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January last year</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> auction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Guterman</ENAMEX> collection in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     There , on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his first shopping trips , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> picked up several paintings at stunning prices .
     He paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.2 million</NUMEX> , for instance , for a still life by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Jansz. den Uyl</ENAMEX> that was expected to fetch perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 700,000</NUMEX> .
     The price paid was a record for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> . -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 64 %</NUMEX> of items offered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> auction were sold , at an average price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 343,333</NUMEX> .
     The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids . -RRB-
     Afterward , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> is said by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> to have phoned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> selling the collection , and gloated .
     `` He says he ` stole them , ' '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> .
     `` And he tells me , ` If you want to see your paintings , you 'll have to come to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> . ' ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> denies phoning and gloating .
     `` It 's just not true , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> quickly became more aggressive in his collecting , with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wachter</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> items .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter</ENAMEX> , who became his principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , searched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">galleries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Monaco</ENAMEX> .
     And , according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter</ENAMEX> had a penchant for introducing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Hall</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , sold Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness</ENAMEX> '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> `` was known to spend a lot of money .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> and particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wachter</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> thus developed a close , symbiotic relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> was eager to assemble a collection for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> has been moving into for the greater part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> , the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> founded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1744</TIMEX> and now under the umbrella of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> , was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> continued to dominate the action in old masters , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's North America</ENAMEX> had lately been touting in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months</TIMEX> , there was optimism all around .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last October</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> paid out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> 's cash -- plus a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 million</NUMEX> commission -- for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Portrait of a Man as Mars</ENAMEX> . ''
     The painting , attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Paul Rubens</ENAMEX> , was purchased privately through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> , not at auction .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1989</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just 15 months</TIMEX> into his campaign , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> was named by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Art &amp; Antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> as one of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> collectors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     `` An unknown quantity to most of the art world , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> is no stranger to lavish spending , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> said , noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat .
     `` He recently bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30,000</NUMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> charity auction for a dinner cooked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the world 's great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs</ENAMEX> , but the final party cost closer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> . ''
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> says it was n't that high . -RRB-
     The art collection might have come to rival the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medicis</ENAMEX> ' had the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> not got wind of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> 's aesthetic adventure .
     In its letter to him , dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 2</TIMEX> and shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Hager</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the thrift-institution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> , expressed puzzlement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> could be so profligate when it had reported losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 13 million</NUMEX> in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two preceding quarters</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 days</TIMEX> to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> eventually extended the deadline to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book value of the collection -LCB- be -RCB- reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> . ''
     In other words : Get rid of all the pictures .
     The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and closed with the admonition to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> : `` Govern yourself accordingly . ''
     The state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> was particularly vexed to learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half-dozen</NUMEX> other paintings listed among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's `` furniture and fixtures , '' were actually hanging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> says that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point he did indeed have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of the paintings at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> and that the rest were in storage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> .
     He explains that he was `` merely storing the paintings at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment '' required for their safekeeping , until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> was ready for them .
     Still , the incident was embarrassing .
     It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> has benefited handsomely from his association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> .
     For instance , he got a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million</NUMEX> loan from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> , negotiated at a below-market rate .
     He owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> 's shares .
     Adding to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> 's problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> -LRB- some with vested interests -RRB- insist that he , relying rather too heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> collection .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">The $ 12 million</NUMEX> lavished on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> , for example , was a record price for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> about its provenance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tunick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">David Tunick Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> question the authenticity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> .
     It may have been painted instead by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> .
     `` The feeling among many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tunick</ENAMEX> says .
     `` It sounds like with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> he got absolutely taken to the cleaners . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Wiener</ENAMEX> , the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Appraisers Association of America</ENAMEX> , agrees that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> paid very dearly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat .
     `` It 's not beyond credibility the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> will someday be worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million</NUMEX> , but whether it could be sold for that amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> remains to be seen . ''
     Still , predicting is tricky .
     `` I 'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan H. Kress</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of the painting 's former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rush Kress</ENAMEX> , dismisses the price talk as `` sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grapes</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> contemptuous of the purchase price , he says , were themselves interested in buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> but lost out .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> , for his part , defends the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> price , saying a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> have never seen the thing itself .
     `` Most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly , '' he says .
     Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> , the investment-banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> tally of investment returns , reported that old masters appreciated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended June 1</TIMEX> , the greatest return of any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> assets it tracked .
     -LRB- Impressionist and modern paintings , not tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> , are ranked even higher at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74 %</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> , moreover , gets its data on art appreciation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> , whose prices go up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> in its thrall .
     The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction .
     Art indexes track winners , not losers .
     But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale .
     Also , at any of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> auctions of old masters , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly one-third to one-fifth</NUMEX> of what is offered does n't sell at any price .
     It 's not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum `` reserve '' prices set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sellers</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preti</ENAMEX> painting that now hangs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> was expected to bring <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">no more than $ 700,000</NUMEX> at auction until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> came along with his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.15 million</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colnaghi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gallery</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.15 million</NUMEX> `` would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preti</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four years ago</TIMEX> . ''
     But from his vantage point , it is n't that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> of his too , overpaid for the work , `` a gargantuan painting by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> who is not a household word . ''
     -LRB- The painting is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 feet</NUMEX> wide , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">seven feet</NUMEX> high . -RRB-
     Rather , `` It just shows things have changed . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn .
     `` They went up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , and they 'll do it again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , '' he declares .
     `` They were a sleeper .
     Everybody was out buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monets</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana Levitt</ENAMEX> says the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> has been `` assisting '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> in selling the paintings .
     And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> in the art world , private art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , `` wo n't be happy to hear it , '' she adds , `` a number of -LCB- the artworks -RCB- have already been sold , and at a substantial profit .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> claims to have sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> paintings , at more than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> profit .
     That is n't <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> , and the claim is n't documented .
     He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> says he had not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> and that he never bid impulsively .
     After all , he had the counsel of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> from the most reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museums</ENAMEX> in the world . ''
     He says he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> -- `` carefully and prudently , just as it was put together . ''
     But in art-world parlance , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> 's holdings are `` burnt . ''
     That is , he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works .
     `` After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> , you can argue there has been natural appreciation , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Theran</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leonard 's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions .</ENAMEX>
     But quick turnover in artwork is `` like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> hold out and try to get a bargain . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> defends itself and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> in the matter .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment .
     `` On occasion , he paid a high price , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachter</ENAMEX> concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Bernhard Levinson</ENAMEX> , a fine-arts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appraiser</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bernhard Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , considers it `` definite conflict of interest for an auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> to both advise a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased .

     CREATIVE ACCOUNTING , mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerates</ENAMEX> , forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs</ENAMEX> to change their way of setting standards to be followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> reporting financial results , standards that had become all too flexible .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Financial Accounting Standards Board</ENAMEX> -LRB- FASB -RRB- was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Accounting Principles Board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</ENAMEX> .
     All of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs</ENAMEX> , provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ' books at the same time .

     The climate was right for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">FASB</ENAMEX> .
     In the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960s</TIMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs</ENAMEX> failed to correct such abuses as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices .
     And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1970</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> had passed a special act to overrule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> board rule .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Keepers</ENAMEX> of the books , dubbed `` figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filberts</ENAMEX> , '' loathed the threat .

     No strikeout , but certainly no home run .

     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Institutional Brokers Estimate System</ENAMEX> , Wall Street market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> see only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> jump in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> profits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> -- unlike in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , when profits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> out looked good -LRB- they did soar <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bulls</ENAMEX> say the market is an incredible bargain , priced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 12</NUMEX> times estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> earnings for stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> index .
     Before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , the P\/E was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> .
     The common view , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Cohen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , is that there will be `` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky-dory .
     Our view is that we may see a profit decline . ''
     Some think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should sell into rallies .
     The market `` is going to wind down , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald W. Perritt</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     `` Things are a little less overpriced '' after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's jolt in the market .
     He expects stocks to decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 5 % to 30 %</NUMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> perhaps bottoming out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2000 and 2100</NUMEX> `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between now and June</TIMEX> . ''
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's decline , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perritt</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> ran statistical tests on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Graham</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1940s</TIMEX> who is widely considered to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of modern securities analysis .
     He found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> still overvalued and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> fairly valued .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Parks</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , expects the market to decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> .
     `` I 've been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> in cash since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> `` will continue to surface as business problems . ''
     `` Generalizations about value are n't useful , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John LeFrere</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Capital Management</ENAMEX> .
     For instance , he says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> might look cheap , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> might continue to do better with stocks like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> , strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     Money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Ross</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duncan Ross Associates Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vancouver</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> , says stocks would have to fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fredric Russell</ENAMEX> , a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tulsa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Okla.</ENAMEX> , says <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's cave-in `` is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> than Wall Street would want to admit . ''
     There are still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX> out there .
     `` I still think we will have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3000</NUMEX> Dow , whether it 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 months</TIMEX> from now I do n't know , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dreman</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreman Value Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're doing a little buying '' in some stocks `` that have really been smashed down . ''
     Many brokerage house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also are optimistic .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> all increased the proportion of assets they recommend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> commit to stocks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> now recommends <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's sell-off was a good thing , because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation .
     `` It was a healthy cleansing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Holland</ENAMEX> , who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Asset Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     From here out , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> see a return to old-fashioned investing , based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's ability to show profit growth .
     `` The fundamentals are pretty strong , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreman</ENAMEX> says .
     `` I do n't see this as a bear market at all .
     It 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's big fall was `` just a blunder by the stock market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Connolly</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> .
     `` It was an overreaction to an event -LCB- the failure of a management and union <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> to get bank financing for a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> -RCB- that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have nagging worries , however .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Newspapers</ENAMEX> are full of headlines about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> defaulting on their debts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> writing off real estate loans .
     That hurts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' confidence in the economy and stocks .
     Not even all the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> see clear sailing ahead .
     `` Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two quarters</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Farrell</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> .
     She thinks the market could drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months</TIMEX> , then recover and go higher .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> with steady earnings growth could do well , she says , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">far more than 10 %</NUMEX> .
