     As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> has shown , uninvited takeovers are still alive despite premature reports of their demise .
     Therefore , the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">boardrooms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">halls</ENAMEX> of academia .
     Although poison pills come in different colors and shapes , they usually give current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> the right to buy more stock of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically , if a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder</ENAMEX> acquires more than a specified percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     However , these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> if they approve of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of poison pills argue that their adoption forces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> to negotiate with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> .
     Recent studies by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgeson &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> with poison pills have experienced greater stock-price appreciation than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> without poison pills during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> of poison pills argue that they harm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> by letting corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run , but also over longer periods .
     Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> issuing the pill .
     Does this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> have a high-quality management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> with a good track record ?
     Does this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period ?
     Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to carry out this strategy ?
     If the answers to these questions are affirmative , then institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill .
     However , the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted , they survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">forever</TIMEX> .
     Although the current management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> may be outstanding , who will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> ?
     Although the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> strategy may be excellent , what will be the strategy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">25 years</TIMEX> ?
     The solution to this problem is a time-limited poison pill .
     The limit could range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years to seven years</TIMEX> , depending on the composition of the management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and the nature of its strategic plan .
     At the end of this period , the poison pill would be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , who would have an opportunity to evaluate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> 's strategy and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> at that time .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> after it received a huge litigation settlement from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> 's poison pill covers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> in order to give current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner .
     Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Intergroup Inc.</ENAMEX> , a diversified holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State of Wisconsin Investment Board</ENAMEX> , which owned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's voting stock , worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to devise a time-limited poison pill .
     This pill automatically expires after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> unless continued by a vote of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     The attitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Wisconsin Investment Board</ENAMEX> reflects a growing receptivity to time-limited poison pills on the part of institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Council of Institutional Investors</ENAMEX> and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions .
     More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> 's strategy .
     Such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> than the abstract debate about poison pills .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ontario Supreme Court</ENAMEX> for unjust dismissal against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> and for libel against its largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Express Ltd.</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hees International Bancorp Inc.</ENAMEX> , which controls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Holders</ENAMEX> at the meeting elected a full slate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hees</ENAMEX> have been feuding for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's election was a sequel to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> disallowed proxies in favor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hees</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ontario Supreme Court</ENAMEX> overturned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> 's decision .
     He later resigned from his executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> , saying that actions by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> `` amounted to -LCB- my -RCB- dismissal . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> said his libel suit seeks <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 million Canadian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 8.5 million</NUMEX> -RRB- from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hees</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manfred Walt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willard L'Heureux</ENAMEX> .

     Buying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller Group Inc.</ENAMEX> is right up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ENAMEX> 's alley in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense : The huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> of tony urban property .
     But in another sense , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 846 million</NUMEX> purchase is uncharacteristically nervy , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     The usually cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> will become the majority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> at a time when tensions over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> property are at an all-time high .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> prefer to focus on the affinities , nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> . `` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Pettit</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> .
     `` On balance , we think it will be positive . ''
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being .
     In particular , they criticize the timing , coming as it does on the heels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> 's controversial purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .</ENAMEX> `` Officially , yes , we encourage the free flow of direct investment , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     `` But they did n't have to choose this particular moment . ''
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> , government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and leading business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> have repeatedly urged <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to refrain from flashy real estate purchases in the
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's other major real estate purchases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 670 million</NUMEX> purchase of an office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:ADDRESS">153 East 53rd St.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui Fudosan Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 610 million</NUMEX> purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Exxon Building</ENAMEX> , part of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Arco Plaza</ENAMEX> was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shuwa Corp.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 620 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">IBM Tower</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Altogether , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S</ENAMEX>. commercial real estate grew from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 7.1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have taken the warnings by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> 's decision to buy into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> reflects the degree to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     `` Those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to refrain , but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S .</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Council</ENAMEX> .
     But to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> , the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> sought out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> and asked it to buy a majority share .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications .
     Finally , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> has no plans to interfere with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> 's management beyond taking a place on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jotaro Takagi</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> may well have found its match in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
     In asset terms , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> is the largest real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The core of its holdings is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">190,000 square meters</NUMEX> of incredibly expensive property in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marunouchi district</ENAMEX> , the business and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , often jokingly called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Mitsubishi Village</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> acquired that property from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some 100 years ago</TIMEX> when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">moat</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> east toward the hodgepodge of tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> and twisted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">alleys</ENAMEX> that made up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> ' district .
     At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> had just opened its doors to the world after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about 250 years</TIMEX> of isolation and needed a Western-style business <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's dream <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">development</ENAMEX> , the story goes , in exchange for the official decision to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's central railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">station</ENAMEX> there .
     That was just an early step in a relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> that has earned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     It 's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures : In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended March 31</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.4 %</NUMEX> of its total revenue came from office building management . Its earnings can rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 12 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> simply from the natural turnover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tenants</ENAMEX> and automatic rent increases , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graeme McDonald</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel Pacific Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest fiscal year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's net income jumped a robust <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35.5 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250.2 million</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area where it has lagged notably behind <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> , which had purchased the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Exxon Building</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshio Shima</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs -LRB- Japan -RRB- Corp</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> is n't the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> overseas purchase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> -- it has already played a leading role in designing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Citicorp Plaza</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> investment is its largest .
     Nonetheless , it will barely make a dent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> 's finances , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase , which are due in cash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next April</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Marunouchi</ENAMEX> holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 10 trillion yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 trillion yen</NUMEX> .
     Moreover , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , which is headed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , it is sure to win a favorable loan .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> signaled they are close to a settlement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , asking a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Superior Court</ENAMEX> to postpone a hearing scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from taking the top posts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .</ENAMEX>
     In separate statements , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> said they want to have `` further discussions . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate transactions valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> , which is being acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> , has filed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> breach-of-contract suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> exclusive contract with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> that requires them to make movies exclusively at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> , and both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business .
     But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last few weeks</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the talks said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is likely to agree to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> participate in certain of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , such as the record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> unit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has surpassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> as the largest record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">club</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's movies .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is expected to agree to swap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> stake in the sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Burbank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> share , in exchange for the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> studio <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lot</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> acquired with the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lorimar Telepictures Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Still , it may be tough for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to have a smooth partnership in anything , in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last week</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> , for example , came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> , who will head a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> that will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , including both records and movies .
     In his affidavit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven J. Ross</ENAMEX> of having an `` antiSony , anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> bias '' and said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> had tried to talk him out of letting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> for that reason .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , who will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> after the merger is complete , denied that in his own affidavit , and called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> 's remarks `` vicious '' and his claims `` reckless , irresponsible and baseless , '' saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> under his leadership has started a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> also said he enjoys `` warm professional and personal relationships '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akio Morita</ENAMEX> , `` who has visited my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> here . ''
     But despite the acrimony between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N.J . Nicholas</ENAMEX> , who will eventually be co-chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> alongside Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> , and were never directly drawn into the fray .
     Talks between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> could unravel , of course , as they have more than once since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> announced its plans to hire Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> .
     But both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> appear to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue .
     And although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has said it wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to fulfill the terms of their contract , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> said in sworn court declarations that they did n't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle .
     Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from any of the projects they were working on at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> projects in various stages of development and production at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , including `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bonfire of the Vanities</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">A Bright Shining Lie</ENAMEX> . ''
     But that does n't mean Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios</ENAMEX> develop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of movies but produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10 to 20</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> .
     Once a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> are typically free to take it elsewhere .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future sequels to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batman</ENAMEX> , '' the blockbuster hit they produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     But in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> will actually get a piece of the profits from `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batman</ENAMEX> , '' since the publicly held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> produce .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> own a combined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and its utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's plea by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Power</ENAMEX> , which came after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> of negotiations , was based on evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Power</ENAMEX> had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vendors</ENAMEX> -- primarily <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Appleyard Agency</ENAMEX> , for example , allegedly made contributions from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1982 to 1984</TIMEX> to various funds for political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> , then submitted bills to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Power</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> also indicated that former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Power</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob F. `` Jake '' Horton</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mastermind</ENAMEX> behind the use of the ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Appleyard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dick Leonard Group II Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hemmer &amp; Yates Corp.</ENAMEX> -- to make payments to various political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1981 to 1988</TIMEX> .

     ` Frequent Drinker ' Offer Stirs Up Spirited Debate
     TO GRAB a bigger piece of the declining scotch market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX> has launched a controversial `` frequent drinker '' promotion for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Chivas Regal</ENAMEX> brand .
     Under the program , dubbed Chivas Class , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who send in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> labels from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Chivas</ENAMEX> bottles will receive an upgrade in seating class on some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> flights .
     Repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices .
     But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse , some liquor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> 's frequent buyer promotion risky .
     `` I 'm surprised they 're doing this , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn Kavanagh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Co.</ENAMEX> , which markets <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Johnnie Walker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">scotches</ENAMEX> .
     `` I would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more , you get more . ''
     Others question the impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Chivas</ENAMEX> 's upscale image of a promotion that has <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> soaking off labels .
     `` It 's really bizarre , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Lerman</ENAMEX> , creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Rich Greene</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Chivas</ENAMEX> has an image of something you would savor , rather than guzzle . ''
     Chivas Class is n't the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such promotion .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J&amp;B Scotch</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TWA</ENAMEX> frequent flier miles in exchange for a label .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dewar</ENAMEX> 's gave discounts on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> merchandise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who sent in bottle labels .
     But the scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Chivas</ENAMEX> promotion sets it apart .
     The current campaign is just the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> leg of an aggressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-to-five-year</TIMEX> direct marketing plan .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two or three</NUMEX> bottles over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-month</TIMEX> period , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Shaw</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> direct marketing .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Borden</ENAMEX> sells considerably more whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> than reduced-fat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milks</ENAMEX> in southern and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> markets , he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Borden</ENAMEX> even tested a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">butterfat</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> , but decided the market was too small .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goya</ENAMEX> is selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Leche Fresca</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 500</NUMEX> grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bodegas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> .

     Because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Leche Fresca</ENAMEX> 's success , he says , the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> is developing other dairy products tailored to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Hispanic</ENAMEX> tastes .
     Jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Makers</ENAMEX> Copy Cosmetics Sales Ploys
     FOR <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">YEARS</TIMEX> , costume jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> fought a losing battle .
     Jewelry displays in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> were often cluttered and uninspired .
     And the merchandise was , well , fake .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> of faux gems steadily lost space in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> to more fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> -- cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     But lately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> say , fake has become more fashionable .
     And jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> 's fashion jewelry business topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.9 billion</NUMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Alberg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Accessories</ENAMEX> magazine .
     And it 's growing fast , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales gains of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> .
     To increase their share of that business , jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Crystal Brands Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trifari</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Swank Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anne Klein</ENAMEX> jewelry , are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     They 're hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels , and they 're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> make a purchase . `` We 've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Renk</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Swank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     But there are limits .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renk</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs .
     Her idea : bring in live zoo <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trifari</ENAMEX> , whose national ads <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> included paper cutouts of its costume finery , takes a tamer approach . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> focuses on the how-to aspects , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew E. Philip</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trifari</ENAMEX> now trains sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">help</ENAMEX> to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> on the best earring styles .
     But cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> still have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big marketing edge : They motivate sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with commissions .
     Jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> rarely pay commissions and are n't expected to anytime soon .

     DESPITE GROWING interest in the environment , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> have n't shown much interest in refillable packages for household products .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Myung Moon</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelist-industrialist</ENAMEX> who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1954</TIMEX> founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unification Church</ENAMEX> , remains the mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> behind a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> political and publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> based in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and catering to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right</ENAMEX> .
     But there may be less there than meets the eye .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> planned to convert <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Old Testament</ENAMEX>-style temporal , political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messiah</ENAMEX> -- and then to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> part of a unified international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">theocracy</ENAMEX> .
     His original strategy -LRB- in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion -RRB- was to create new economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions .
     Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds .
     More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> movement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> , as they had in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> .
     Then he would move his movement to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     But that was not to be .
     Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesmen</ENAMEX> for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unification Church</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> in the anticult movement gave wildly exaggerated membership figures .
     Their legacy lives on .
     It is still common to read in the press that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000 or more</NUMEX> full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> . ''
     Some estimates have gone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 80,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity-seeking heights , as when it organized a spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Yankee Stadium</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">bicentennial</TIMEX> rally in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , there actually were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 2,000</NUMEX> full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unification Church</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's support for a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Watergate</ENAMEX>-beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Koreagate</ENAMEX> scandal , and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> 's recruitment efforts .
     Defections , burnouts , and abduction `` deprogrammings '' kept member turnover high .
     That the membership number has even kept close to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> size is the result of the `` graying '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> .
     Many of the enthusiastic young `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Moonies</ENAMEX> '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> era who remained faithful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> are now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> , producing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> by procreation rather than conversion .
     The reputed wealth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unification Church</ENAMEX> is another matter of contention .
     For a while in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> it seemed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> was on a spending spree , with such purchases as the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">New Yorker Hotel</ENAMEX> and its adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Manhattan Center</ENAMEX> ; a fishing\/processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> ; a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Christian Brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">monastery</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mansion</ENAMEX> -LRB- both picturesquely situated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Hudson River</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Uruguay</ENAMEX> ; a motion picture production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York City Tribune</ENAMEX> -LRB- originally the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News World</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and the successful <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noticias del Mundo</ENAMEX> .
     Yet these purchases can be misleading .
     Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fund-raisers</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">peanuts</ENAMEX> or begging outright at traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">intersections</ENAMEX> brought in somewhere near <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> a year during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-to-late 1970s</TIMEX> , but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's lavish international conferences , speaking tours , and assorted land buys .
     Only his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> , employing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> at subsistence wages and producing everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">rifles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">ginseng</ENAMEX> to expensive marble vases , kept the money flowing westward .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Virginia Commonwealth University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bromley</ENAMEX> , who more than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> has delved into the complex world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unificationist</ENAMEX> finances , has concluded that profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> have been the exceptions rather than the rule .
     Likewise , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burgess</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Isikoff</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> have estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 800 million</NUMEX> was transferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> operating losses in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-language <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> illustrate the scope of this financial drain .
     Start-up costs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX> alone were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 50 million</NUMEX> , and the total amount lost in this journalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">black hole</ENAMEX> was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> has inaugurated a pair of high-quality glossy opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The World and I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Insight</ENAMEX> , which are a further drain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Insiders</ENAMEX> say that not even their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> know for sure how much these show-piece <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publications</ENAMEX> , along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> , have cost Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> church-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , such as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> to build fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessels</ENAMEX> , are defunct .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">components</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> had their budgets cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> -- and press scrutiny -- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX>-person get-togethers in fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">digs</ENAMEX> and exotic locales of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past</TIMEX> .
     I attended several of these in the dual role as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> of research findings as well as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paragon House</ENAMEX> eventually even published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of my co-edited books on religion and politics . -RRB-
     According to veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unificationist</ENAMEX> affairs , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Gordon Melton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute for the Study of American Religion</ENAMEX> , almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> are being drastically reduced as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> now concentrates more on developing his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> .
     `` Everything , '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> non-`` Moonie '' senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Unification Church</ENAMEX> recently told me in an interview , `` is going back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> . ''
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> had proved even less hospitable than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> were less reluctant to have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> investigate and harass new religions . -RRB-
     So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> is in retreat , refocusing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> continue to be profitable .

     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F.

     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> had claimed that she did n't have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year and a half</TIMEX> after Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> and her late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX> , the ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> , fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> , they were charged with racketeering , conspiracy , obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 million</NUMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">homeland</ENAMEX> .

     The law is meant to overcome delays caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> ' use of foreign procedures to block <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> requests for records , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said in his opinion .
     For instance , the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has charged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcoses</ENAMEX> ' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     On the allegation of kidnapping , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> wrote , `` The suggestion that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> was brought to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> also said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marital testimonial privileges cited by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> do n't apply .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one permits a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> to refuse to testify against her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said that privilege 's purpose is `` fostering harmony in marriage . ''
     Because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 28</TIMEX> , the privilege can no longer apply , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> said .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marital privilege cited by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> protects confidential communications between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said that privilege is meant to protect private utterances -- not litigation papers filed with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> , as Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> maintained .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> threw out most of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's objections , he agreed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of her concerns : that turning over the foreign documents could violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's constitutional right against self-incrimination .
     As a result , he said he will examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> documents sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> to determine whether turning over the filings is self-incrimination .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> also directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> to show that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> right against self-incrimination wo n't be violated .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , a strict regimen governed the staff meetings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's technical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's western suburbs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire .
     No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , so younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> -- often the most enthusiastic and innovative -- seldom spoke up at all .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , the badges and the `` do n't speak out of turn '' rule were abolished -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> has instituted flex-time work schedules and allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to dress casually , even in blue jeans .
     A rule forbidding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> to own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> has been lifted , and now many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> drive foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> to get useful ideas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX>-old corporate song filled with references to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Mount Fuji</ENAMEX> has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vocalist</ENAMEX> .
     And in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> corporate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> recently opened the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coed company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">dormitory</ENAMEX> for single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at the suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> technical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> . `` We had lots of internal debate about this one , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tadahiko Fukuyama</ENAMEX> , a senior public-relations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     `` But in the end , top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> decided to follow the voice of the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> . ''
     This corporate glasnost is a big reason <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of making lackluster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and lousy profits , has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits , ranging from the sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Maxima</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Porsche</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">300ZX</ENAMEX> to the whimsically nostalgic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Pao</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minicar</ENAMEX> sold only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's turnaround is far from complete ; many crucial tests are just beginning .
     But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in trouble .
     The big one : A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's culture ca n't be radically changed unless top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atsushi Muramatsu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for finance , helped set the tone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1986</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was heading toward the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> operating loss by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's postwar recovery .
     `` This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yutaka Kume</ENAMEX> , who took the helm as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1985</TIMEX> , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed . ''
     No wonder .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> and the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-largest , was getting beat up not only by its bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> , but also by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> , the most successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> but a relative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pipsqueak</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's market share in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> had been dropping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the decade</TIMEX> .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales sagged , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen .
     Worst of all , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> was preoccupied with management infighting , cronyism and corporate rigidity .
     Consider the experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satoko Kitada</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">30-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of vehicle interiors who joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     At that time , tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority .
     `` The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> got to work on the dashboard , '' she recalls .
     `` The next level down did doors .
     If a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> got to work on part of the speedometer , that was a big deal . ''
     This system produced boring , boxy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> just were n't buying .
     Desperately hoping to spark sales , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealerships</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> ordered everyone from top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to rookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> to go `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> watching , '' to visit chic parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to try to gain insights into developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trend-setters</ENAMEX> .
     Some town-watching excursions were downright comic .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> group of middle-aged manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> was supposed to check out a trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     But when they arrived at the door , all were afraid to go in , fearing that they would be out of place .
     Other trips were more productive .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> himself visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aoyama district</ENAMEX> .
     He liked the well-lighted lobby display of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> so much that he had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished .
     Later , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> borrowed other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> practices , including an engineering `` idea contest '' to promote inventiveness .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> developed a `` crab <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> '' that moves sideways .
     Such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced , but they seem to be genuine -- so much so , in fact , that some older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have resisted .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> handled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">die-hards</ENAMEX> in a typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> fashion : They were n't fired but instead `` were neglected , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kouji Hori</ENAMEX> , the personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Nissan Technical Center</ENAMEX> .
     Despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> completely revamped its near-luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17,699</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Maxima</ENAMEX> , which competes against a broad range of upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedans</ENAMEX> ; it replaced its boxy , pug-nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines .
     Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> also has launched new versions of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13,249</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">240SX</ENAMEX> sporty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">coupe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">300ZX</ENAMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     The restyled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">300ZX</ENAMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 33,000</NUMEX> and is squared off against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Porche</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">944</ENAMEX> , which begins at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 41,900</NUMEX> .
     Besides new styling , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissans</ENAMEX> have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> are outselling their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">predecessors</ENAMEX> by wide margins .
     In its home market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> has grabbed attention with limited-production <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minicars</ENAMEX> featuring styling odd enough to be cute .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Pao</ENAMEX> , a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">coupe</ENAMEX> with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy-eyed look .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> initially planned to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Paos</ENAMEX> , but sales have passed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> , and there 's a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> waiting list for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     Then , there 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">S-Cargo</ENAMEX> , an offbeat delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">van</ENAMEX> with a snail-like body that inspired its name .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> helped develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> as its design theme .
     The chairs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">S-Cargo</ENAMEX> seats , and a gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Pao</ENAMEX> 's oversized speedometer .
     All these vehicles have sharply improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's morale and image -- but have n't done much for its market share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> car market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> before beginning a depressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight-year</TIMEX> slide that continued through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Strong sales so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> are certain to turn the tide , but even the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> market share that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> expects in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> will leave it far below its position at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the decade</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market-share losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> until at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> , and even that timetable might prove optimistic .
     `` Everyone else is going to catch up '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's innovative designs , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Rama Krishna</ENAMEX> , auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's pace of new-model hits will slow , he adds , just as arch-rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> unleashes its own batch of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     Likewise , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> has grabbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</NUMEX> of the car market so far this year , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     But even that brings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> only to the share it had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , and leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> behind its high of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     Why ?
     So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential .
     In compact and subcompact <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , the bread-and-butter sales generators for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> still trails <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> hopes that that will start to change <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> , with its new version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Stanza</ENAMEX> compact <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Stanza</ENAMEX> has been a nonentity compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> 's hugely successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Accord</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Camry</ENAMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> has revamped the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Accord</ENAMEX> and made it a midsized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> instead has kept its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Stanza</ENAMEX> a bit smaller than that and cut the base price <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> ; at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11,450</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Stanza</ENAMEX> prices start <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 749</NUMEX> below the predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> yet have a more-powerful engine .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Accord</ENAMEX> prices start at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12,345</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's risk is that its low-base-price strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> .
     But `` on a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , a rebate does n't work well '' because it cheapens the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> 's image , contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas D. Mignanelli</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> .
     Even if the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Stanza</ENAMEX> succeeds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> will remain behind in the subcompact segment , where its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Sentra</ENAMEX> does n't measure up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Civic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Corolla</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> will introduce a completely revamped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Sentra</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next fall</TIMEX> .
     At the opposite end of the market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> launches its luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> division on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 8</TIMEX> -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> pioneered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> went on sale .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> started advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> fully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight months</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> hit <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">showrooms</ENAMEX> .
     The ads featured fences , rocks and pussy-willow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> -- almost anything but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> themselves .
     The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto advertising .
     On the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's sales goals for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> are modest compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> will build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 3,500</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Q45</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedans</ENAMEX> each month , sending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> of them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and keeping the rest for sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> wants to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 49,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">LS400</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> alone .
     `` When I saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> sales projections , I got worried , '' confesses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takashi Oka</ENAMEX> , who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> .
     But on reflection , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oka</ENAMEX> says , he concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's big business move for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX> , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oka</ENAMEX> says .
     Despite plans to add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , bringing the total to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> wo n't show profits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least five years</TIMEX> , he adds .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">These days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> had record net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">114.63 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 868 million</NUMEX> -RRB- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year ended last March 31</TIMEX> , a remarkable recovery from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.39 billion yen</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years earlier</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> lost money on operations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> car sales .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> expects to earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 120 billion yen</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current fiscal year</TIMEX> , a modest increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> .
     The big reason : For all its cost-cutting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> remains less efficient than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its last fiscal year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's profit represented just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</NUMEX> of sales , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> .
     To help close the gap , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> recently established a top-level cost-cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is the world 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> currently building vehicles in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of the world 's key economic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">arenas</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     That gives it an enviable strategic advantage , at least until its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> catch up , but also plenty of managerial headaches .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> -- for manufacturing , sales , design , research , etc. -- that report separately back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> beat back a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Auto Workers</ENAMEX> organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> bitter .
     `` We are in a transitional phase from being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to becoming an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muramatsu</ENAMEX> , the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     He promises that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> will soon establish a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> overseeing all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , just as it 's doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps the biggest challenge , however , will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues .
     Already , personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are talking about the need for a `` Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> '' cultural-reform effort of some sort .
     `` We are still only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> way through the turnaround of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and there are many more things to do , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> says .
     He adds , however , that `` the momentum we have generated is unstoppable .

     As expected , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Bros . Records</ENAMEX> said it agreed to form a recorded-music and music-publishing joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Records</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Azoff</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> said it will provide financing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , but did n't disclose terms .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> has n't named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> yet , but any records it produces will be distributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> , which is in the process of being acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> resigned as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Records</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , and had been discussing a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> .
     In a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> said he chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , the largest record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , because `` their standing in the entertainment industry is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to none .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> will hold an informal meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early December</TIMEX> , a move that should give both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> a political boost at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements .
     Rather , senior administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> will meet on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 2</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">3</TIMEX> , alternating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the two days</TIMEX> of meetings between a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX> .
     The unusual seaborne meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> , at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed .
     In announcing the meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> that neither he nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> expects any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
     Instead , he said that the purpose is simply for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to get `` better acquainted '' and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda .
     Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have said that a meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> could help bolster his stature among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> , whose support he needs .
     For his part , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been criticized regularly at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     A face-to-face meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who has been the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> relationship , praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for arranging the meeting .
     But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> meeting , which was announced simultaneously in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , will be held in the unusual setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides</ENAMEX> to limit participation to just small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> .
     `` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> , at a news conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , said , `` As the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides</ENAMEX> plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year , they found it useful , I would say even necessary , to hold an interim informal meeting . ''
     Although no specific agreements are expected , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> said `` that does n't mean they will be without an agenda . ''
     If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> meetings , their talks would include human rights , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> reforms , regional disputes , relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> , economic cooperation , arms control , and joint efforts to fight narcotics , terrorism and pollution .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> specifically mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic advice to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> as a possible topic .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> been publicly urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to drop its restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> trade .
     He recently told a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , possibly at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> summit .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> hope a trade agreement would give them <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">Most-Favored Nation</ENAMEX> status , which would lower the tariffs on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pravda</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> reported that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2005</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> proposing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> start a system of unemployment benefits .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy or other issues .
     `` Do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arms control , or the environment , '' he said .
     `` Those things will all come up , but in a fairly informal way . ''
     Instead , this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said , `` This is vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> .
     This was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> 's own idea .

     Aside from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other issue the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions .
     Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navies</ENAMEX> of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> .
     That theme has been a recurring one for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     They argue that as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Kremlin</ENAMEX> follows through on announced plans to cut land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' area of greatest strength -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> should show more willingness to cut sea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's area of greatest superiority .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Reykjavik</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iceland</ENAMEX> .
     That meeting sent shivers through the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">alliance</ENAMEX> because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> without consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that he initiated talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last July</TIMEX> , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> readily accepted .
     But word of the possible session was closely held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handful</ENAMEX> of top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> , and word of it did n't reach many <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few days</TIMEX> .
     Indeed , many senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had been insisting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was n't interested in such an informal get-together .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , it actually was the arguments of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">bloc</ENAMEX> itself that led the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to seek the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> meeting .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> decided he wanted the meeting after talking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> , who urged him to support Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's efforts to transform the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> system and to urge him to loosen his grip on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> said .
     While flying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> from those discussions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> drafted a letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .

     Hardly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> passes without news photos of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> dragging limp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> from some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> in one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     Of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abortionists</ENAMEX> , anti-nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> , animal rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> , college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> concerned about racism , anti-apartheid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> , various self-styled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> '' and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> .
     Maybe he did n't start it , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohandas Gandhi</ENAMEX> certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahatma</ENAMEX> , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> .
     Unfortunately , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Webster 's Biographical Dictionary</ENAMEX> , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> imprisonment . ''
     I am not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of everything <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> did , but some of his law breaking was justified because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> was then under occupation by a foreign power , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them .
     It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change .
     Where truly representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> disagrees with it .
     There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it .
     The case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Parks</ENAMEX> , the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who refused to sit at the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> , comes to mind as an illustration .
     But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience .
     It is true that both are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them .
     Lawful demonstrations , such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others , are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking .
     The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience ; but , before we get on with that , let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations .
     They are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute .
     The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics .
     Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews .
     At best , demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative ; at worst , they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking .
     Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile .
     Petty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> and street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> looking for excitement attach themselves like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">remora</ENAMEX> to the fringes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> trashing , arson , window breaking , looting , pocket picking and general hooliganism .
     Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania .
     There are better ways to promote a cause .
     Where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece , rather than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime , it is difficult to justify .
     Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like .
     They say these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause .
     The crimes may appear small , but the prices can be huge .
     Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases to illustrate .
     Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> or a careless accident involving a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> lie down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> , blocking traffic , and will not move until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> carry them away .
     Assume that someone caught in the jam has a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> .
     There is no way to get an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ambulance</ENAMEX> in quickly to move him to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> .
     He dies .
     The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor , but its impact on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> was violent and terminal .
     Assume that a TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> is airing a celebrity interview program with a live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> .
     In a planned protest against his appearance , several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program can not continue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> must refund money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> and loses considerable revenue and prestige .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> have been non-violent , but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute .
     It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience , so the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> coming home to roost . ''
     Or maybe the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> would lose nothing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geraldo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX> would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> .
     Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> indirectly , yet does irreparable damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> as a whole .
     I am referring to those young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who chose to disobey their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's call to arms during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> and fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> or some other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sanctuary</ENAMEX> to avoid combat .
     Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience , which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war they characterized as `` immoral , '' weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict .
     Even more at fault are those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> who urged and supported their defections , thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">propagandists</ENAMEX> .
     It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cambodia</ENAMEX> do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned .
     Worse , it remained to a well-meaning but naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> .
     Under the guise of `` healing the wounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> pardoned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of draft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaders</ENAMEX> , thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's `` immorality . ''
     The precedent having been set , who can complain if future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> called upon to defend the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over ?
     Finally , I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> of intensive media coverage .
     Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> invitation will be required .
     This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations .
     Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ?
     Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> produced the movement .
     In either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience .
     If you have not , it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course .

     The tax increase , which will be considered at a special session of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> that begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , would cover only part of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the estimated $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion</NUMEX> in total damage caused by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 17</TIMEX> quake .
     Aside from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 3.45 billion</NUMEX> in recently approved federal aid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 700 million</NUMEX> .

     Newsprint results continued to be depressed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> added , because of industrywide price discounting .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Courts</ENAMEX> have ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> must submit to TCMP audits , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> will excuse from the fullscale rigors anyone who was audited without change for either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Rewards have been suggested -- but never adopted -- for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filers</ENAMEX> who come through TCMP audits without change .
     PENALTY OVERHAUL is still likely , congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> say .
     Long-debated proposals to simplify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX> civil penalties and make them fairer and easier to administer are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> tax bill .
     But they were stripped from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> estimated penalty revenue would fall by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 216 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     Still , congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment , even if not this time around , although some provisions may be modified .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ark.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> on the issue who generally backs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> plan , wants some changes -- for one , separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed , not a single penalty .
     He would ease the proposed penalties for delayed payroll-tax deposits and for faulty Form 1099 and other reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> correct voluntarily .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> urges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to ensure that all penalties retain their force as deterrents .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">TAXPAYERS</ENAMEX> ' RIGHTS are defined by a growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> duties to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> ' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">States</ENAMEX> are following suit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> enacted a rights law in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> have adopted rights laws , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federation of Tax Administrators</ENAMEX> , a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">group</ENAMEX> , reports ; the features vary .
     And taxpayer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are urging legislation in many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Committee on State Taxation</ENAMEX> , which comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX> multistate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and advises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Council of State Chambers of Commerce</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Cahoon</ENAMEX> says its efforts begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> have led to the introduction of bills in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado</ENAMEX> to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> also seeks uniformity among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> in provisions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> ' rights .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> announced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-point policy patterned on the federal bill of rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> .
     THE MILEAGE RATE allowed for business use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> has risen to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.5 cents</NUMEX> a mile for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24 cents</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> says ; the rate stays <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 cents</NUMEX> for each added mile .
     Also unaltered : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents</NUMEX> for charitable activities and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine cents</NUMEX> for medical and moving costs .
     IRA BALANCES could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reps.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrews</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     The bill would thwart a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> opinion that investing individual-retirement-account funds to earn free checking violates the law .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">HUGO</ENAMEX> FELLED vast timberlands .

     HE RODE HIS HOBBY , but he could n't milk it , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tax Court</ENAMEX> says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> often weighs deductions of sideline-business costs : Do they stem from a profit-seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby ?
     But it 's rare to see both functions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles O. Givens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mount Vernon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> - investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-accountant</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a former stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> - bred <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> Walking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horses</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years</TIMEX> , raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> , and never made a profit on either .
     He claimed losses totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42,455</NUMEX> -- and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> denied them all .
     Special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloway</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Givens</ENAMEX> managed horse-breeding in a businesslike way : He kept detailed accounts , practiced soil conservation , enhanced his experience by consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> , spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> a day doing chores , and dropped the sideline when his best brood <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mare</ENAMEX> died .
     Yet he took little businesslike care with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> : He had no prior experience and did n't seek business counsel about them .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Givens</ENAMEX> may deduct his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30,180</NUMEX> of losses from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> breeding , but rejected the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12,275</NUMEX> in deductions from the cattle operation .
     BRIEFS :
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> already is doing intensive TCMP audits of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,000</NUMEX> returns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1988</TIMEX> filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> with under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> in assets ... .

     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> awarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 60 million and $ 100 million</NUMEX> in back pay , a decision that could complicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's bankruptcy-law reorganization .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal .
     It 's unclear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> will succeed in overturning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> petition and its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> acquisition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX> .
     All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's previous court efforts to head off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' demands have failed .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said he does n't expect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's strategic plan . ''
     Bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's case .
     Like any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creditor</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> will have to apply to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> for payment of their claim .
     That may leave a lot of leeway for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> Bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton R. Lifland</ENAMEX> to decide what , if anything , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> actually collect .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , he issued the ruling that let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> pursue their back-pay grievance before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> calls for a mutually acceptable private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> to resolve such grievances .
     In a statement to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was disappointed by the ruling .
     `` The obligation is totally unwarranted , '' the statement said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Linsey</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Air Line Pilots Association</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were extremely pleased .
     `` This is a blow not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> but to the creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , has consistently opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' claim , which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reorganization plan to pay off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's debts .
     An earlier plan , which had received the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> ' approval in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , fell apart when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> changed its business plan .
     It is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan .
     The dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' contract .
     The clause was part of an agreement in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> got a raise .
     Shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX> took control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> received a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> pay raise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> argued that this triggered a pay raise for them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> has disputed the claim , but a federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , an appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> have all sided with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> put the amount <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 100 million</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million</NUMEX> .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> is hearing another pay parity case between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     A decision on that case is n't expected before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-November</TIMEX> .
     Ironically , many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> involved have left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> or are still striking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> , which filed for bankruptcy protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 9</TIMEX> .

     Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the advertising business have raised as many hackles as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvin A. Achenbaum</ENAMEX> .
     The general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> may not know his name , but he 's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles : A marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , he pioneered slashing ad agency commissions , to the delight of advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> and the dismay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> , after beating them , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> is joining them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide</ENAMEX> named Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">62</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> of professional services , reporting directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past</TIMEX> , the ad industry 's most distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> did n't hesitate to excorciate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> .
     They have since mellowed , although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Young &amp; Rubicam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , echoing others , said : `` I think ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> owe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl -LCB- Spielvogel -RCB-</ENAMEX> a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business . ''
     But industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> also believe hiring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> is a shrewd move for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> has counted among his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> some of the most visible blue-chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> clients <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.P.

     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , he will work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> on marketing strategies ; aside from agency compensation issues , he helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , for example , come up with its positioning and pricing for its new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> line .
     His client <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contacts</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , could prove a gold mine for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> that has had few new business wins of late .
     `` I 've done <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 40</NUMEX> ad agency searches -LCB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> -RCB- , so I have a pretty good notion of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> are interested in when they look for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> said .
     As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , he has given seminars at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ENAMEX> on how to win new business .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> said he hopes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> will do some strategic consulting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">non-clients</ENAMEX> , in hopes that they become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> . ''
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> 's hallmark has been personal involvement with all major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     He pampers them ; he invites them to fabulous parties ; he strokes them .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> , too , delves into his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> ' business .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> has a much higher degree of intimacy with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> than is ordinary for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> his size .
     And with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> 's record of being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delver</ENAMEX> and a detail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> , you can see how the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fit , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gottesman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> 's move follows the announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> that his consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Canter</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">66</TIMEX> , would retire .
     When the announcement came out , `` I picked up the phone and said , ` Why do n't you come to us ? ' '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> , who had been considering paring down his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> or merging it with another small consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outfit</ENAMEX> , soon agreed .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> , having met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about 25 years ago</TIMEX> .
     Before becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> was a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J. Walter Thompson Co .</ENAMEX>
     He spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies , but became best-known for chipping away at ad agency compensation .

     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achenbaum</ENAMEX> pioneered negotiated fees , which often worked out to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15 %</NUMEX> .

     He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation , however , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> did n't seek him out for anything else .
     `` I was very frustrated , '' he said .

     He will concentrate on , among others , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.P. Morgan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai</ENAMEX> .

     `` The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising , and going towards other services , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> , whose hair is thinning and gray and whose face has a perpetual pallor , nonetheless continues to display an energy , a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> dare say only privately .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">66-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> recently spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> discussing the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> and the world with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> in his plainly furnished , wood-paneled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">office</ENAMEX> .
     The interview did not touch on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's domestic affairs .
     Skipping personal pleasantries , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> picked up exactly where he left off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months earlier</TIMEX> -- before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> crackdown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> -- when he had warned that the orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> feared a plurality of views .
     Excerpts follow :
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's turmoil : `` It is a very unhappy scene , '' he said .
     `` It took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Ziyang</ENAMEX> -LRB- former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> and party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> who understood how the Western economies work and now that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is part in exile , part being rusticated and part missing . ''
     Rebuilding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> predicted , will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another 10 years</TIMEX> .
     `` That 's very sad for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> could have been a good engine for growth , not just for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> but for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> . ''
     On similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> : `` In important particulars , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> are different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> .
     They are already industrialized ... .
     Their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> problem is much greater -- it 's how to industrialize to begin with . ''
     Asked if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , wo n't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one day</TIMEX> face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said , `` I would think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> -- I mean keeping their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cut off from the outside world .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , he said , is ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in his awareness of the world .
     `` But I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> are more introverted than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> . ''
     Regardless , he said , he still believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy , may well manage to improve considerably .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> prosperity : `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another 15 years</TIMEX> , with adjustments , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> can grow and not cut back , and so too , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Singapore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">ASEAN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> -- then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> , the economies of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves .

     In such an arrangement , `` all benefit , '' he said .
     `` And if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> come in , they benefit too .
     It 's not a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-sum game . ''

     An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> bloc is n't intended , he said .
     `` That 's not possible . ''

     The total relationship , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to fund the deficits , the investments the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are making in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in order to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> demand that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> products consumed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> should be made as much as possible in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> technology and capital .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe , a device that he and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are studying with great hope .
     Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery , the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps most exciting , the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain .
     The probe , which is painless , non-invasive and apparently harmless , employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain .
     If positioned over the brain 's motor-control area , the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles , making , say , a finger twitch .
     In principle , they will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to check the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> 's motor system the way an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrician</ENAMEX> tests a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> 's electrical circuits by running current through them .
     `` Until now , we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Chiappa</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> conducting clinical tests with the devices at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOSPITAL">Massachusetts General Hospital</ENAMEX> .
     `` All we could do was tell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> , ` squeeze my fingers as hard as you can ' or ` raise your arm . '
     `` Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective ; when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is unconscious , they do n't work at all .
     Magnetic brain tweaking started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mayo Clinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs .
     But for brain tests , the unwieldy machines `` would have required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to stand on their heads , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reginald Bickford</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California at San Diego</ENAMEX> .
     The field took off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Sheffield University</ENAMEX> developed a handy , compact magnet for brain stimulation .
     Since then , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> commercial versions have been put on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 500</NUMEX> have been sold .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> conference on such devices attracted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> , who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy .
     `` We do n't feel we can use -LCB- the devices -RCB- routinely in surgery yet , but we 're getting close , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> , who is now with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     A problem , he adds , is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones .
     The devices could help indicate when surgery would help , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Tator</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurosurgeon</ENAMEX> .
     For example , paralyzed car-crash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that , if preserved by emergency surgery , enable partial recovery .
     But such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial .
     `` The cost -LCB- of magnetic stimulators -RCB- would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function '' in such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tator</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> caution there is a chance the magnet technique might spark seizures in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epileptics</ENAMEX> .
     But no significant problems have been reported among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tested with the devices .
     The main sensation , besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings , is `` like a rap on the head , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Bridgers</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> who has studied the brain stimulators at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale University</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone .
     And some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> who have conducted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of tests on themselves report temporary headaches .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadwell Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kennewick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Novametrix Medical Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wallingford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , now sell versions of the magnetic devices .
     The machines , which at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12,500</NUMEX> are inexpensive by medical standards , have n't been approved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand , legs and other non-brain areas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> can apply for permission to use the probes for brain studies .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Kentucky</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Currier</ENAMEX> , a physical therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> , is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery .
     Similarly , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Purdue University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> led by heart <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.A. Tacker</ENAMEX> hopes to develop ways to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions . The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacker</ENAMEX> , whose prototype was dubbed the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacker</ENAMEX> whacker . ''
     The devices ' most remarkable possibilities , though , involve the brain .
     Probing with the stimulators , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor-control resources after an amputation .
     Similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ' brains regroup -- a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">State University of New York at Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> flash <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> .
     Between flashes , certain areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> ' brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator .
     When the jolt is timed just right , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> do n't recall seeing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group of letters .
     `` Where does that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stimulus go ? '' exclaims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">SUNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Maccabee</ENAMEX> .
     `` Trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories , '' such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes .
     He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">SUNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Magnet Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators .
     Among other things , the stronger devices may be able to summon forth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-forgotten memories and induce mood changes , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologists</ENAMEX> say .
