     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Arizona Corporations Commission</ENAMEX> authorized an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5 %</NUMEX> rate increase at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tucson Electric Power Co.</ENAMEX> , substantially lower than recommended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> by a commission hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">barely half</NUMEX> the rise sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> .
     The ruling follows a host of problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tucson Electric</ENAMEX> , including major write-downs , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einar Greve</ENAMEX> during a company investigation of his stock sales .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> regulatory ruling calls for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42 million</NUMEX> in added revenue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">yearly</TIMEX> , compared with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57 million</NUMEX> boost proposed by the commission hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had sought increases totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> .
     The decision was announced after trading ended .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tucson Electric</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.875</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tucson Electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> was disappointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> 's decision and `` concerned about the financial integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Tae Woo</ENAMEX> , brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again , said the currency 's current level against the dollar is `` appropriate . ''
     His comments , made in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> ' questions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Press Club</ENAMEX> here , signaled that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> is resisting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> pressure for a further rise in the currency 's value .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants a higher won to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> 's exports more expensive and help trim <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want a devaluation instead , arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's export performance .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason the won 's value remains heavily controlled .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> said a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand for the removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> import quotas on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> will be resolved `` satisfactorily '' but gave no hint when that will happen .
     Speaking to a joint meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> earlier , he said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> ca n't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues `` without causing political and social trauma .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great American Bank</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> approved the formation of a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> enabling the savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law .
     The proposed holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's primary purpose would be to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great American</ENAMEX> to continue engaging in real estate development activities , it said .
     Those activities generated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.1 million</NUMEX> in operating profit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great American</ENAMEX> , such profits do n't count toward meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's new capitalization requirements under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> federal law .
     The new real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law .
     The proposed holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would also consolidate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great American Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tucson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> into a single , federally chartered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Lang</ENAMEX> , who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> completed the acquisition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> , is candid about the challenge he is taking on .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> admits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> is `` in dire straits '' and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive .
     But the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> ' problems .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX> , he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> would begin publishing without advertising .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> will do away with expensive circulation drives , not to mention sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , and attempt to publish the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">17-year-old</TIMEX> magazine supported by circulation revenue alone .
     `` Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> can publish a money-losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> .
     I want to publish one that succeeds , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang </ENAMEX>.
     `` For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> , it 's time to publish for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertiser</ENAMEX> . ''
     As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> , which competes directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seventeen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> says that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two years</TIMEX> he will spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 million</NUMEX> promoting and improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> has grown quickly since its debut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1988</TIMEX> , it has been the target of conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> and skittish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> said the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> were `` blind-sided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Moral Majority</ENAMEX> ... .
     Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out . ''
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> will keep its irreverent tone , but added , `` We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> mark and advertising pages have stabilized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300</NUMEX> .
     What 's more , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> says he has what all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> wish for : a bona fide niche .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seventeen</ENAMEX> is written more for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> , not their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang </ENAMEX>.
     `` But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> has a different spirit .
     It gets more mail in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall</ENAMEX> 's got in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> , and it 's not from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> .
     I feel about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> like I did about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> took on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matilda Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> by his newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matilda</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> owns the rest through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp Venture Capital Partners</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two weeks ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> pumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800,000</NUMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matilda</ENAMEX> just to keep the doors open .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have congratulated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> on what some call his `` courageous '' handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> , but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews .
     Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> , closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Success</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Mother</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> , with circulation near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Mother</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">625,000</NUMEX> circulation , are legitimate magazine success stories .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Success</ENAMEX> , however , was for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> lackluster and unfocused .
     Only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Success</ENAMEX> is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> for growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Mother</ENAMEX> have operated as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman\/McCall 's Group</ENAMEX> , a less-than-successful joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> is being undone , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> being sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Magazine Group</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 80 million</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> agreeing to sell back its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Mother</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang </ENAMEX>.
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Inc . Magazine Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of Time Warner , have said the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> was n't a good one .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , was supposed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's low-cost , safe entry into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> , a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall </ENAMEX>'s put in a less than stellar performance .
     Until a recent comeback , it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> complained about the shoddy editorial quality , and in the end , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who asked not to be identified said , `` Frankly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall 's</ENAMEX> and the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> were an embarrassment . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's priorities changed .
     `` Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> changed right after -LCB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> was formed -RCB- , and I do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> 's service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> . ''
     Today , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> believes his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> will offer what many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> do n't .
     `` We write straight for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> on their level , '' he said .
     `` We do n't have passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> points out that even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Success</ENAMEX> , in part , fits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's image , since <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> is female .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> has named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Taber</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">43</TIMEX> , as group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> .
     She will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Success</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> , and retain her post as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> .
     The sale price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall 's</ENAMEX> -- twice what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> originally paid for it -- will finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> ' buy-back of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Working Mother</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> says he is n't scouting new acquisitions , at least for now .
     `` We would have to go outside to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to get the money and I am not ready to do that , '' he said .
     `` Besides , we have enough on our plate .
     There is plenty of work to be done on what we have .

     The impact of the destruction of this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">2.5-mile</NUMEX> stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> was tragically measured in lost lives .
     But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor .
     It could easily be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> before the well-traveled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">artery</ENAMEX> that helps connect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> could soar to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 250 million</NUMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles J.

     So why even consider stacking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeways</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> ?
     `` We 've run out of places to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeways</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">L.A.</ENAMEX> , and the only place to go is up , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connell</ENAMEX> said , although he acknowledges there are many obstacles , including cost .
     But as for safety , he says double-deck <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeways</ENAMEX> built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sylmar</ENAMEX> quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5 to 8</NUMEX> on the Richter scale .
     Reasons for the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> were sketchy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But most structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or `` liquefy , '' in a major quake .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadway</ENAMEX> , designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1940s</TIMEX> and completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1957</TIMEX> , was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement , they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal `` ties '' that run horizontally through the column , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Parker</ENAMEX> , a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caltrans</ENAMEX> today uses a variation of the design Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> describes , with spiraling steel rods inside .
     But in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">nearly 15 feet</NUMEX> below .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caltrans</ENAMEX> reinforced the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> as part of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million</NUMEX> statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> to the columns and prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> from swaying in a quake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caltrans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Drago</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> declined to identify the engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that did the reinforcement work .
     Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> took `` reasonable care '' to build and maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structures</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Messina </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tacoma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , personal-injury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> brought in to strengthen the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structure</ENAMEX> could be liable as well .
     The results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messina</ENAMEX> says .
     Given the seismic history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> , `` it seems to me that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> earthquake is a foreseeable event . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caltrans</ENAMEX> ' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drago</ENAMEX> defended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> 's work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> .
     `` The work was done properly , '' he said .
     `` Basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> could n't withstand . ''
     Ironically , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Caltrans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> began working on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of seismic reinforcements of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeways</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , this time wrapping freeway columns in `` steel blankets '' to reinforce them .
     But only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> supported with single rows of columns were top priority , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> , supported by double rows , was left out , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drago</ENAMEX> explained .
     `` The reason is that the technology is such that we 're not able to retrofit multi-column structures , '' he said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly .
     In the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> .
     Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> in action .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> were accused of responding too slowly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Exxon Valdez</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tanker</ENAMEX> split open in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> waters and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Carolina</ENAMEX> coast , and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> announced that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> got his first earthquake briefing of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 a.m.</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself essentially acknowledged that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> were trying to head off criticism .
     On his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> visit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that he hoped there would be `` less carping '' about the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> 's performance this time , adding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> `` took a hit '' for its reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .

     The lethal shudders that wracked the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX> -- rated a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> on the Richter scale -- did n't match the great earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> , rated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.25</NUMEX> .
     The difference of just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.35</NUMEX> points on the scale , designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Richter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">CalTech</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> , means the older quake was `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 20</NUMEX> times stronger , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane Johnson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California Berkeley Seismographic Station</ENAMEX> .
     The ground ruptured along a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">20-to-30-mile</NUMEX> stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Andreas Fault</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> added .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> , the rupture was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">300 miles</NUMEX> long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a couple feet</NUMEX> wide .
     Though the epicenter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's temblor was located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 miles</NUMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">50 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion .
     But the greatest damage was visited on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadways</ENAMEX> perched upon landfill , as were the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina District</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas of maximum devastation .
     `` Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Segar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of geosciences at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">San Francisco State University</ENAMEX> in a televised interview .
     `` It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern .
     Our quake behaved much like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mexico City</ENAMEX> earthquake , where great damage was miles from the epicenter . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson </ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> seismographic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">station</ENAMEX> , said : `` Landfill can be done if it 's properly compacted .

     He cited the example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's financial district , where many new glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">towers</ENAMEX> survived almost unscathed .
     But the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> predicted .
     `` The attention span of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is short , '' he said .
     `` We 've known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> we 've got lots of old -LCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre-1950s</TIMEX> -RCB- unreinforced brick and masonry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Golden State Bank Building</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Front Street</ENAMEX> , had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake , leaving a wedge of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> floor open to the air , while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> below narrowly missing rush-hour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     Reinforcing such old building stock , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said , `` comes down to money .
     It 's a danger .
     We know it 's there .
     And sooner or later , we have to do something about it . ''
     The urgency is heightened because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's earthquake -- while major and followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of aftershocks -- did n't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon .
     `` The big one is still due , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> predicted in an interview .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> very dangerous faults , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Andreas</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Hayward</ENAMEX> fault and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Calaveras</ENAMEX> fault .

     But now , the soft-drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> appears willing to take the risk .
     `` The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Classic Coke</ENAMEX> has tremendous value , and they have n't merchandised that name before , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Meyers </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beverage Digest</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said a caffeine-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Classic</ENAMEX> should help increase volume of the original brand .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have said that the absence of new products , among other factors , has limited sales growth throughout the industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coke</ENAMEX> now leads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX> in market share in caffeine-free diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">colas</ENAMEX> but trails <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX> in sales of caffeine-free sugared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">colas</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beverage Digest</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coke</ENAMEX> introduced a caffeine-free sugared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cola</ENAMEX> based on its original formula in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> .
     It switched to a caffeine-free formula using its new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coke</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coke</ENAMEX> has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Classic</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     He said large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">drinks</ENAMEX> make the timing right <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
