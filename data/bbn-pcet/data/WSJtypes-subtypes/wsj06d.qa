     PROGRAM TRADING is being curbed by more securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , but big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> are expected to continue the practice , further roiling the stock market .
     Bowing to criticism , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> in suspending stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts .
     Still , stock-index funds are expected to continue launching big programs through the market .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are organizing to complain about program trading and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's role in it .
     The effort is being led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel</ENAMEX> .
     Personal spending rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , the smallest gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     The slowdown raises questions about the economy 's strength because spending fueled much of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> GNP growth .
     Meanwhile , personal income edged up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> .
     Factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are buying new machinery at a healthy rate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> , machine-tool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> say .
     But weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> sales raise questions about future demand from the auto sector .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southern</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Power</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> may plead guilty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> to charges it illegally steered company money to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties</ENAMEX> .
     The tentative pact would resolve part of a broad investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> sweetened their plan to merge cellular phone operations , offering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> a special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42</NUMEX>-a-share payout .
     But the new pact will force huge debt on the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> and could still fail to thwart rival suitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> posted a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 648.2 million</NUMEX> loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> as it moved quickly to take write-offs for various problems and prepare for a turnaround .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> wonder how strong the recovery will be .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> agreed to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 370 million</NUMEX> .
     The accord helps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> pay off debt and boosts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> candy market to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> are expected to go head to head in the markets to buy up rival <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> confirmed it received <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> antitrust clearance to boost its holding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui Electric</ENAMEX> agreed to sell a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> stake to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110 million</NUMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the accord does n't suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is opening up to more foreign takeovers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> suspended work on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> cereal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , indicating a pessimistic outlook by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cereal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , which has been losing market share .
     Insurers could see claims totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 billion</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake , far less than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nashua</ENAMEX> strengthened its poison-pill plan after announcing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is seeking to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 25 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> copier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> is cutting back its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil and gas exploration and production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 15 %</NUMEX> as part of a restructuring of the business .

     -LRB- During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past century</TIMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> on the idea of the decimal system for currency , thus saving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> the headaches of pounds , shillings and pence .
     But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> had invented .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> opted for the inches , feet and yards the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> had brought with them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> did n't dislike metrics ; they simply ignored them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> felt differently .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1807</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX> who headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey</ENAMEX> made <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">an `` iron meter</NUMEX> '' that he had brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> the standard of measure .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> had embraced the system .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Businessmen</ENAMEX> took their cue from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> finally passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Metric Conversion Act</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> , industry was far ahead .
     Because the law made compliance voluntary , it inspired little more than jokes .
     -LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> had a field day with questions about what would happen to `` six-footer , '' `` yardstick '' and `` inchworm . '' -RRB-
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is barely aware , much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> manufacturing or selling overseas , have made metrics routine .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> , for example , uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trains</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- In auto advertising , however , items such as wheelbases are still described in inches . -RRB-
     Farm-machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deere</ENAMEX> work in the metric system .
     The liquor industry went metric <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has led the charge , particularly as military alliances spread world-wide .
     New weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">systems</ENAMEX> will be around until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next century</TIMEX> , notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tascher</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Department</ENAMEX> 's metric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> .
     Still , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , when dealing with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyman</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sticks to the tried and true .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> are still measured in inches and pounds .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whittle Communications L.P.</ENAMEX> , which for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> has fought a public relations battle with education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , said it has signed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to subscribe to the controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Channel One</ENAMEX> news program and its sister programs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Channel One</ENAMEX> , a satellite-delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> program supported by advertising , is scheduled to be launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next March</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whittle</ENAMEX> said its field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> signed up the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">238</NUMEX> school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only eight weeks</TIMEX> and company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> now expect to reach their start-up goal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Whittle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Knoxville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> , said that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1990</TIMEX> he expects to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Channel One</ENAMEX> installed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> with a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six million</NUMEX> .
     Installation of the TV system , which includes providing free <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">19-inch</NUMEX> TV sets in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classrooms</ENAMEX> , begins in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .
     `` What we 've done in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight weeks</TIMEX> shows we wo n't have enormous difficulties getting to the place we want to be , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> .
     He said his sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is signing up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> at the rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> a day .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Channel One</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> said private and parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> will be canvassed to see if they are interested in getting the programs .
     Subscribing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> get the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-minute</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Channel One</ENAMEX> news program , whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> TV ads during each show have drawn protests from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subscribers</ENAMEX> also get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Classroom Channel</ENAMEX> , which will feature ad-free educational programming similar to some public-TV shows , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Educator 's Channel</ENAMEX> , which will offer instructional programming for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> and will be supported by advertising .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> has met some resistance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Educational Network</ENAMEX> , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> has named the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs , has been offered to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,290</NUMEX> school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> continues to negotiate with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">919</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10 %</NUMEX> of the school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> approached have rejected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> said that so far , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> that carried the program in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-week</TIMEX> test <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> have subscribed to the program .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Withrow High School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> , rejected the project .

     `` The number of correct responses was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> on the test and school absences did n't change much , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruner</ENAMEX> .
     `` The pilot program was received well -LRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> -RRB- , but there was n't reason enough to sign up .

     Wham ! Bam !
     Twice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> the unraveling of the on-again , off-again <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out slammed the stock market .
     Now , stock prices seem to be in a general retreat .
     Since peaking at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2791.41</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 9</TIMEX> , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">194.69</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> , closing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2596.72</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.01</NUMEX> .
     The number of issues falling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each day</TIMEX> is eclipsing the number of gainers .
     And the number of stocks hitting new lows far outstrips the number setting new highs .
     But why should an iffy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market ?
     Opinions vary about how important the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal was to the market 's health , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> generally agree that the market gyrations created as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> plan crumbled revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology .
     `` If this had happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> when the atmosphere was still very positive it would n't have been greeted with anything like the impact it has had over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two weeks</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Jarrett</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> .
     There are , of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> who view the near-panic that briefly swept through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> and again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 24</TIMEX> as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market .
     Sure , price action is volatile and that 's scary , but all-in-all stocks are still a good place to be , they suggest .
     The reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> debacle `` is mindless , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Connolly</ENAMEX> , chief market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned .
     The only way you can make it a big deal is to draw linkages that just do n't make sense . ''
     He suggests , for example , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may have assumed that just because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> could n't get financing , no leveraged buy-outs can get financing .
     Carried even further , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing propping up stock prices , the market would collapse if no more LBOs could be done .
     `` There will still be deals , '' argues Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX> .
     `` There may not be as many and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> may not get away with some of the things they 've done in the past , but deals wo n't disappear . ''
     He forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls `` strategic deals , in which somebody is taking over a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> not to milk the cash flow , but because it 's a good fit . ''
     And even without deals , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX> figures the market would remain healthy .
     He notes , for instance , that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , yet that average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only three weeks ago</TIMEX> hit a record high .
     `` Those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up , '' he says .
     Even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad , in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX> 's view .
     For the long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who picks stocks carefully , the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> .
     `` Who can make the better decision , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who has <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 seconds</TIMEX> to decide what to do or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> with all the time in the world ? '' he says .
     `` What on earth does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal have to do with the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walmart</ENAMEX> , which I was able to buy on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 16</TIMEX> at a very attractive price ? ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrett</ENAMEX> also sees some benefits to the stock market 's recent drop .
     `` We 've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy , '' he says .
     `` The balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin -- in this case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal -- we got a little pop . ''
     The pop sobered up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who had been getting a little too ebullient , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrett</ENAMEX> .
     `` It provided an excuse for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to get back to reality and to look at the economic data , especially the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> economic numbers , and to realize that we ca n't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk bond market . ''
     But he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued , even with the economy obviously slowing .
     `` Just because we 've got some realism back in the market does n't mean it 's going lower from here , '' he says .
     `` The bottom line is that it 's healthy to have this kind of sideways activity , especially after a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> gain in stock values over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 12 months</TIMEX> . ''
     He 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation , the Dow Jones Industrial Average will once again forge new highs .
     Maybe , maybe not .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Joseph Cohen</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , is n't nearly so sanguine about the market 's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon .
     Her view is that stock prices have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major props : merger and buy-out proposals , earnings and the economic outlook .
     At current levels of economic activity and earnings , stocks are fairly valued , she says .
     But any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> has obviously put a damper on that .
     `` Stocks are n't cheap anymore , there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals , '' she says .
     `` I 'm not saying they 've stopped altogether , but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high . ''
     But that 's not the only problem for stocks .
     The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> props -- earnings and the economic outlook -- are troubling , too .
     `` M&amp;A is getting all the headlines right now , but these other things have been building up more gradually , '' she says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing , the outlook for earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> and all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> is getting worse .
     `` There are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices , '' she says .
     With all this , can stock prices hold their own ?
     `` The question is unanswerable at this point , '' she says .
     `` It depends on what happens .
     If the economy slips into a recession , then this is n't a level that 's going to hold . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     Stock prices tumbled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a third consecutive day</TIMEX> as earnings disappointments , a sluggish economy and a fragile junk bond market continued to weigh on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.01</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2596.72</NUMEX> in active trading .
     Volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,330,000</NUMEX> shares .
     Declining issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> were far ahead of gainers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,108</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92.42</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4 %</NUMEX> .
     Oil stocks escaped the brunt of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's selling and several were able to post gains , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> , which rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 3\/8</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4 million</NUMEX> shares .
     The stock 's advance reflected ongoing speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> is accumulating a stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones Professional Investor Report</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the rumors , but several industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Professional Investor Report</ENAMEX> they believed it was plausible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> may be buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 3\/8</NUMEX> on a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> is said to have raised his stake in the oil and steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just about 15 %</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> boosted his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.4 %</NUMEX> .
     Elsewhere in the oil sector , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> rallied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 3\/4</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> was unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 3\/4</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> , which said it plans to cut its exploration and production work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 %</NUMEX> in a restructuring , dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 1\/8</NUMEX> .
     The precious metals sector outgained other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> by a wide margin for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consecutive session .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hecla Mining</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Battle Mountain Gold</ENAMEX> climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 3\/4</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Homestake Mining</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 7\/8</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lac Minerals</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Placer Dome</ENAMEX> went up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 3\/4</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASA Ltd.</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 5\/8</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Echo Bay Mines</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 7\/8</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pegasus Gold</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Corona</ENAMEX> Class A gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 1\/2</NUMEX> .

     Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have identified the problem in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last July</TIMEX> 's crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> flight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> : a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight .
     The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">DC-10</ENAMEX> 's hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash that killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Flight 232</ENAMEX> 's tail engine from a cornfield near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Sioux City Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> .
     The safety <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> will begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four days</TIMEX> of hearings on the accident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sioux City</ENAMEX> .
     Among the issues the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> will examine is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks .
     The engine involved was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CF6-6</ENAMEX> made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FAA</ENAMEX> 's acting executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for regulatory standards and compliance , said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:NUCLEAR">titanium</ENAMEX> during its production almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX> .
     He said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that time</TIMEX> , and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FAA</ENAMEX> already has ordered that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">232</NUMEX> disks made by the old process be removed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber .
     Such tests make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FAA</ENAMEX> confident that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sioux City</ENAMEX>-type accident `` wo n't happen again , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has been working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FAA</ENAMEX> all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections . ''
     But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's engine production .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CF6-6</ENAMEX> series engines are n't being manufactured any more ; they are only being used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">DC-10 Series 10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> currently in service , he said .

     A frozen mountaintop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Tibet</ENAMEX> may offer an important clue about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> is warming perilously .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Ohio State University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> have analyzed samples of glacial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Tibet</ENAMEX> and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past half-century</TIMEX> than in any similar period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 10,000 years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice samples</ENAMEX> are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> has warmed considerably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent times</TIMEX> , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the century ahead</TIMEX> .
     A substantial warming would melt some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> 's polar ice caps , raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas .
     `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lonnie Thompson</ENAMEX> , a research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Ohio State</ENAMEX> who dug for and analyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice samples</ENAMEX> .
     To compare temperatures over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 10,000 years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> analyzed the changes in concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">oxygen</ENAMEX> .
     These measurements can indicate temperature changes , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> said , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change .
     Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Dunde ice cap</ENAMEX> , a glacial plateau in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Tibet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">17,000 feet</NUMEX> above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1937-87</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">any other 50-year</TIMEX> period since before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last Ice Age</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> said .
     Some climate models project that interior regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> would be among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice-core samples</ENAMEX> are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> acknowledged .
     According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely caused by burning of fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> , will cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> to warm up because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> prevents heat from escaping into space .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Skeptics</ENAMEX> say that if that 's the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past century</TIMEX> , reflecting the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Dunde</ENAMEX> ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1900 through the early 1950s</TIMEX> , decreasing temperatures from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the late 1950s through the mid-1970s</TIMEX> , then higher temperatures again through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings .
     `` Climate varies drastically due to natural causes , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> .
     But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice samples</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Peru</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greenland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Antarctica</ENAMEX> all show substantial signs of warming .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an $ 8.5 billion</NUMEX> military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> while revamping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budget to move <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 450 million</NUMEX> from foreign bases to home-state projects .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> measure builds on a pattern set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> defense authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> , and -- at a time of retrenchment for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> and concern about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable .
     Total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests for installations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> , for example , are cut by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost two-thirds</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> added to the military budget for construction in all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> at home .
     The result is that instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's proposed split of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-40</NUMEX> between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70-30</NUMEX> .
     The extra margin for bases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> enhances the power of the appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> ; meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> used their positions to garner as much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had requested for their individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .

     Though spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> was far less , their increases above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests --<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT"> 640 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">430 %</NUMEX> , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> at critical junctures .
     The swift passage of the bill , which cleared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> on simple voice votes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 66.8 billion</NUMEX> measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs .
     By an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84-6</NUMEX> margin , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> approved the bulk of the spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , but the bill was then sent back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> could seek to waive these restrictions , but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere .
     Appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> have used an assortment of devices to disguise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 1 billion</NUMEX> in spending , and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> have awakened to these devices , the bill can seem like a wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caribou</ENAMEX> trying to make it past <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wolves</ENAMEX> to reach safer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> grazing .
     Much of the excess spending will be pushed into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> , and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow-spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster-spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed .
     For example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference ostensibly increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> budget for construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 592 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200 million</NUMEX> above what either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber</ENAMEX> had previously approved .
     Part of the increase would provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 million</NUMEX> toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> .
     But as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 177 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 30 %</NUMEX> of the account , is marked for potential transfers to research , management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip .
     The bill 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> face criticism , too , for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservatives</ENAMEX> , embarrassed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> influence-peddling scandals at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> , have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX>-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , but received little support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> , which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments .
     Within discretionary funds for community development grants , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3.7 million</NUMEX> is allocated to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of a subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Traxler</ENAMEX> .

     Although we were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX> , the same economic factors affected us as affects the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farney</ENAMEX> writes about .
     Fortunately , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> with a college degree bought a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farm</ENAMEX> and moved us <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">50 miles</NUMEX> north to good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">eight-year-old</TIMEX> .
     Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> .
     Most of the land in that and other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Delta</ENAMEX> are now owned by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     These are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who used -- and sometime abused -- their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sharecroppers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life .
     Following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> , when one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with mechanized equipment could farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> formerly requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , the surplus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were dumped into the mainstream of society with no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare .

     In the meantime , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> continue receiving generous subsidies that began during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">New Deal days</TIMEX> .
     Or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and other areas have suffered , but those along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Mississippi</ENAMEX> continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> living in economic slavery .

     Because the cycle of poverty along the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Mississippi</ENAMEX> goes back so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> , breaking this cycle will be next to impossible .
     Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral .
     Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Delta</ENAMEX> are waiting for that big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> to educate apathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .

     Many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Poverty is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> blocks from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> .

     Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Sugar Ditch</ENAMEX> , '' but when you travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , the same problems exist .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 %</NUMEX> as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that it was going to reduce employment in production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     The exploration side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which it also lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said in response to questions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil Exploration &amp; Producing U.S. Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> involved , currently has a work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of somewhat <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 5,000</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> restructured the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> during an industrywide shakeout .
     But since then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil production has declined and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> alluded to the work-force cuts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> when it took a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> charge as part of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings and attributed it to a restructuring .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">future quarters</TIMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they have been studying ways of streamlining these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year</TIMEX> .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the coming months</TIMEX> , layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will be peeled away and regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> will become more autonomous .
     For greater efficiency , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at those locations will be reorganized into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The main feature of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> is that each local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles E. Spruell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     Field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Orleans</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Midland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tex.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bakersfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Liberal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan.</ENAMEX> , will be maintained .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> will be increased .
     For instance , employment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> will be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">430</NUMEX> .
     But on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bakersfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> will grow by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">305</NUMEX> .

     Wanted : An investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 billion</NUMEX> of CDs maturing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> , when many of them bought their CDs , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> certificates were yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 9 %</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> willing to look could find double-digit yields at some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     Now , the nationwide average yield on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> CD is just under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.5 %</NUMEX> is about the best around .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy .
     Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months ago</TIMEX> .
     And the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there .
     `` If you 're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD , you 're not going to find it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis M. Gurtz</ENAMEX> .
     There are , however , some alternatives that income-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should consider , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say .
     Short-term municipal bonds , bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return .
     In particular , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are confronting right now , of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates .
     A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> should remember their money is n't all or nothing -- they do n't need to be shopping for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bethesda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Schaeffer</ENAMEX> .
     Here 's a look at some of the alternatives :
     SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators .
     Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one to five years</TIMEX> .
     That 's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax -- and from state and local taxes too , for in-state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     For an investor paying tax at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> rate , a seemingly puny <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> yield on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> muni is equivalent to a taxable <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> .
     Rates approach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> municipals .
     Some of the more cautious CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> might like `` pre-refunded '' municipals .
     These securities get top credit ratings because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> have put aside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> bonds that will be sold to pay off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> when the municipals are retired .
     `` It 's a no-brainer : You do n't have to worry about diversification ; you do n't have to worry about quality , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven J. Hueglin</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> bond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gabriele , Hueglin &amp; Cashman Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Consider a `` laddered '' bond portfolio , with issues maturing in , say , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> , advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm A. Makin</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Westerly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">R.I.</ENAMEX> , financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> .
     The idea is to have money rolling over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> at prevailing interest rates .
     BOND FUNDS :
     Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell .
     That makes them a reasonable option for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year or so</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Buyers</ENAMEX> can look forward to double-digit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> returns if they are right .
     But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead .
     Bond resale prices , and thus fund share prices , move in the opposite direction from rates .
     The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens .
     Consider , for instance , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bond funds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard Group of Investment Cos.</ENAMEX> that were both yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.6 %</NUMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent day</TIMEX> .
     The Short Term Bond Fund , with an average maturity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2 years</TIMEX> , would deliver a total return for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10.6 %</NUMEX> if rates drop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.6 %</NUMEX> if rates rise by the same amount .
     But , in the same circumstances , the returns would be a more extreme <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.6 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 %</NUMEX> for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund , with its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 1\/2-year</TIMEX> average maturity .
     `` You get equity-like returns '' from bonds if you guess right on rates , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Wilson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> .
     If interest rates do n't change , bond fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields .
     DEFERRED ANNUITIES :
     These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts : Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn , but a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 59 1\/2</TIMEX> .
     Aimed specifically at CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity .
     An interest rate is guaranteed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between one and seven years</TIMEX> , after which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 days</TIMEX> to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities .
     Some current rates exceed those on CDs .
     For instance , a CD-type annuity from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">North American Co.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Life &amp; Health Insurance</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , offers <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 %</NUMEX> interest for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> or a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> rate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> .
     Annuities are rarely a good idea at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 35</TIMEX> because of the withdrawal restrictions .
     But at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 55</TIMEX> , `` they may be a great deal , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> .
     MONEY MARKET FUNDS :
     That 's right , money market mutual funds .
     The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present , when rates seem headed down .
     With average maturities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> or so , money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates , with a slight lag .
     Still , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> even if rates fall , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Witman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Market Advisor</ENAMEX> newsletter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> .
     That 's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 1 1\/2</NUMEX> percentage points above the average CD yield .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witman</ENAMEX> likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund , with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> compound yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 9.5 %</NUMEX> .
     A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> , its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor</ENAMEX> .
     Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates , suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Back Bay Advisors Inc.</ENAMEX> , a mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New England Insurance Co .</ENAMEX>
     If rates unexpectedly rise , the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon Sobel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of metabolism and endrocrine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug products</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toseland</ENAMEX> 's findings `` fairly intensively .

     Defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> have complained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> can not determine priorities because it has no strategy .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last April</TIMEX> , the new defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Cheney</ENAMEX> , acknowledged that , `` given an ideal world , we 'd have a nice , neat , orderly process .
     We 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> does n't work that way . ''
     With a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> defense plan costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1.6 trillion</NUMEX> , it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     This wo n't happen until <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> come down from their ivory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures .
     As it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy to counter these threats , we determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> .
     These procedures consume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> of labor and produce tons of paper , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> , their end product -- the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Five Year</TIMEX> Defense Plan -- promptly melts away .
     The graph on the left shows how this happens -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 30 , 1989</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Compare the past eight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> plans with actual appropriations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats .
     Strategy , however , is about possibilities , not hopes and dreams .
     By ignoring costs , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions .
     That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean counters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">budgeteers</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pork-barrelers</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have different agendas .
     And as a result -- as the recent vote by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> to undo Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> 's program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense `` strategy . ''
     How can we turn this situation around ?
     Reform starts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Strategists</ENAMEX> should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process .
     They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program .
     They would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets .
     They would also identify the best way to add programs , should the budget come in at higher levels .
     This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning .
     There is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> steps are necessary to translate this idea into action .
     Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cleans up our books .
     Our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> plan contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has committed itself to by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 100 billion</NUMEX> .
     Negative money was invented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> to make the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1990-94</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Five Year</TIMEX> Defense Plan conform to the numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's final budget submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 billion</NUMEX> .
     To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 billion</NUMEX> .
     It is known in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> as the `` negative wedge . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 billion</NUMEX> in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">future years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 billion</NUMEX> in an `` above guidance '' management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> plan also assumes inflation will decline to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters</ENAMEX> , including those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> , assume inflation will be in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> in each of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     At that rate , the defense plan is underfunded by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48 billion</NUMEX> .
     By adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate , we arrive at a baseline program costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 trillion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1990 and 1994</TIMEX> .
     Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> examines how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security .
     The graph on the right -LRB- which assumes a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> rate of inflation -RRB- , places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 30 , 1989</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations .
     Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> will answer the question : What happens if these increases do not materialize ?
     Scenario <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , known as the `` Constant Dollar Freeze , '' reimburses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> for inflation only -- it slopes upward at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> per year .
     This scenario has been the rough position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , and it reduces the baseline by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 106 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1990 and 1994</TIMEX> .
     Scenario <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , the `` Current Dollar Freeze , '' has been the approximate position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about four years</TIMEX> .
     It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to eat the effects of inflation until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> .
     This reduces the baseline by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 229 billion</NUMEX> .
     Scenario <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> extends the recent compromises between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> ; it splits the difference between Scenarios <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , by increasing the budget at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> per year .
     It reduces the baseline by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 169 billion</NUMEX> .
     Finally , Scenario <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> reduces the budget by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> per year for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five years</TIMEX> -- a total reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 287 billion</NUMEX> .
     This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     The strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses .
     They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations .
     This exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> to make hard decisions .
     If , for example , they choose to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">B-2 Stealth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">bomber</ENAMEX> , they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battlegroups</ENAMEX> or army <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">divisions</ENAMEX> -- as they moved toward lower budget levels .
     These trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">B-2</ENAMEX> became prohibitive .
     Some may be tempted to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous Zero-Based Budgeting -LRB- ZBB -RRB- concept of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     But ZBB did not involve the strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> , and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics .
     Anyway , ZBB 's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia .
     A strategic review is fundamentally different .
     It would be run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">joint chiefs</ENAMEX> under simple directions : Produce the best possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> for each budget scenario and provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> with a comprehensive net assessment of how that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> could be used to achieve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> goals .
     It might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , and unfortunately , there is some truth to it .
     But in the end , it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons .
     To say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest ; in other words , that it is justified in committing a crime -- lying to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> -- because it is morally superior .
     Strategy is not a game between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> ; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives .
     If we want meaningful priorities , we must understand the trade-offs they imply before we make commitments .
     Strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events ; it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial , cultural and physical limitations .

     Although bullish dollar sentiment has fizzled , many currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say a massive sell-off probably wo n't occur in the near future .
     While Wall Street 's tough times and lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest rates continue to undermine the dollar , weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors .
     `` By default , '' the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming days</TIMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francoise Soares-Kemp</ENAMEX> , a foreign-exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're close to the bottom '' of the near-term ranges , she contends .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading , the dollar was at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8300 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.65 yen</NUMEX> , off from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Thursday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8400 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.10 yen</NUMEX> .
     The pound strengthened to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5795</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5765</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.70 yen</NUMEX> , down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.75 yen</NUMEX> .
     The dollar began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on a firm note , gaining against all major currencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> dealings and early <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> trading despite reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> was seen unloading dollars around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.70 yen</NUMEX> .
     The rise came as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> .
     But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , the dollar was dragged down , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say , by the stock-market slump that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.01</NUMEX> points .
     With the stock market wobbly and dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> discouraged by signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic weakness and the recent decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say the dollar is still in a precarious position .
     `` They 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Scalfaro</ENAMEX> , a foreign-exchange marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Montreal</ENAMEX> .
     While some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the dollar eventually could test support at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.75 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> yen , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scalfaro</ENAMEX> and others do n't see the currency decisively sliding under support at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.80 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">140 yen</NUMEX> soon .
     Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats .
     With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies , `` you do n't have a confirmation '' that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Malpede</ENAMEX> , senior currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refco Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     As far as the pound goes , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say a slide toward support at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5500</NUMEX> may be a favorable development for the dollar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say it is in critical condition .
     Sterling plunged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about four cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> 's low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5765</NUMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> resigned from his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-year</TIMEX> post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     He was succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> , who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> interest rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation .
     But the market remains uneasy about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound , currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> contend .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's slowing economy is headed for a recession , it is widely believed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> .
     If there are any signs that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge , that currency is expected to fall sharply .
     `` It 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> than there were under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Roberts</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of international bond market research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     `` There 's very little upside to sterling , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> says , but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> 's appointment apparently has run its course .
     But some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have a stormier forecast for the pound , particularly because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.6 %</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> is burdened with a struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and large current account and trade deficits .
     The pound likely will fall in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming days</TIMEX> and may trade as low as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.60 marks</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Rendell</ENAMEX> , an international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     The pound was at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8896 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> , off sharply from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.9511</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week earlier</TIMEX> .
     If the pound falls closer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.80 marks</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> may raise <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's base lending rate by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rendell</ENAMEX> .
     But such an increase , he says , could be viewed by the market as `` too little too late . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> by declining to raise the official <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     Pound concerns aside , the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say .
     The dollar has a `` natural base of support '' around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">140 yen</NUMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> currency has n't been purchased heavily in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soares-Kemp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> .
     The yen 's softness , she says , apparently stems from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> bond issues and persistent worries about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's upheaval in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> for current delivery jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.80</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 378.30</NUMEX> an ounce , the highest settlement since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 12</TIMEX> .
     Estimated volume was a heavy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">seven million ounces</NUMEX> .
     In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 378.87</NUMEX> an ounce .

     We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989</ENAMEX> '' was `` crafted primarily by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harkin</ENAMEX> '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled</ENAMEX> ... .

     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> are citing the compromise on the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989</ENAMEX> '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations .
