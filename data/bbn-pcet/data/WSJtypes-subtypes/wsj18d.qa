     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> still stands .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who built it has fallen .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> removed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the staunchest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holdouts</ENAMEX> against the reform rumbling through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> world , in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> .
     But while it was a move that stunned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East bloc</ENAMEX> , it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> replaced Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , who had led <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">18 years</TIMEX> and before that headed its security apparatus , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> cut of the same cloth : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> , the most recent internal-security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> and a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protege</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> , it is clear , is no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> now shares power with the democratically elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Solidarity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">union</ENAMEX> .
     Nor is it a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> , where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> into a multiparty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">democracy</ENAMEX> .
     Still , any change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> has enormous implications , for both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">West</ENAMEX> .
     It raises the long-cherished hopes of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">52</TIMEX> , was named the new party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Party</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Central Committee</ENAMEX> convened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">East Berlin</ENAMEX> .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">ADN</ENAMEX> claimed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-man <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> was twice hospitalized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">ADN</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , a hard-line <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Stalinist</ENAMEX> who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1961</TIMEX> supervised the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> , also was relieved of his title as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> and his position as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is expected to be formally named to all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> positions once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> convenes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> 's ignoble fall culminates nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two decades</TIMEX> of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">77 years old</TIMEX> , built <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">East Germany</ENAMEX> into the most economically advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">bloc</ENAMEX> .
     His grip on power unraveled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> , dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule , fled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">West</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> more have taken to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last month</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ' uprising in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1953</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change .
     The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> , provided he is willing to institute reforms .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have strong doubts that he is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> : `` Whether that -LCB- the leadership change -RCB- reflects a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">East</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">West</ENAMEX> relations , I do n't think so .
     Because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has been very much in accord with the policies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> added : `` There is no clear-cut <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of reform , that we know of , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> . ''
     Indeed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> said on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> television <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> .
     He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can express themselves .
     The removal of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and several senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> fought over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last week</TIMEX> to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
     But , with public demonstrations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> growing in size and intensity , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and several key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> lost out in this battle , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guenter Mittag</ENAMEX> , who has long headed economic affairs , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Hermann</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of information policy .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were also relieved of their duties <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> will alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's resistance to fundamental change .
     Clearly , the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in this process is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> .
     Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1937</TIMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">eight years old</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> ended .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl </ENAMEX>, he represents the postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that has grown up during <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> 's division .
     Since joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> as its youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> had acquired the nickname `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown prince</ENAMEX> , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have had strikingly similar career paths , both having served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of internal security before their rise to the top party position .
     Moreover , both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy .
     Notably , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> 's few official visits overseas came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> , when he visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> after the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
     He later defended the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's response during a separate visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Protestantism</ENAMEX> in particular fears Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> , in part because of an incident in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1988</TIMEX> when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX> who had sought refuge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Church</ENAMEX> .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> also has a reputation for being politically savvy .
     His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> , he was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the power struggle that toppled Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has sought to project a kinder image .
     According to a report widely circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">East Berlin</ENAMEX> , it was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> who ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to stop using excessive force against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Leipzig</ENAMEX> .
     `` He does n't want to have the image of the gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Oldenburg </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bonn</ENAMEX>-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute of East European and International Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cologne</ENAMEX> .
     `` He 's not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX> -- he wants to have the image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX> . ''
     As part of his image polishing , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and reassert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> 's authority .
     Besides sacking other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who allied themselves with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> could loosen controls on the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">media</ENAMEX> , free up travel restrictions , and establish a dialogue with various dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> .
     But will it be enough ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are doubtful .
     `` He does n't signify what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want , so the unrest will go on , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oldenburg</ENAMEX> predicts .
     At the same time , the expectations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are great and will continue to grow .
     Says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> : `` What 's necessary now is the process of democratization .
     Not just that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , has invited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> to open discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bonn</ENAMEX> on a wide range of subjects .
     Reports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> press , citing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> , suggest Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may serve only as a bridge between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and a genuine reform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     Adding to that speculation is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> 's reputation as a heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinker</ENAMEX> , who is said to also suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bonn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> adds .
     The selection of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may also disappoint <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has pressed hard for a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's rigid stance .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> reform-minded party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> as possible successors to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dresden</ENAMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Modrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guenter Schabowski</ENAMEX> , were passed over .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> could intensify .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> sent Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> to heed growing calls for change .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tass</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> expressed the conviction that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Unity Party</ENAMEX> of -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East -RCB- Germany</ENAMEX> , being sensitive to the demands of the time , ... will find solutions to complicated problems the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">GDR</ENAMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX> -RCB- encountered . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of younger pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     The older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't .
     From the perspective of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> , reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's reason for being .
     Unlike the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> of the bloc , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> is a creature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Cold War</ENAMEX> .
     Erasing the differences still dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , and the vast international reordering that implies , wo n't endanger the statehood of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> .
     But it could ultimately lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> reunification and the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> from the map .
     Which is what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Guard</ENAMEX> fears .
     `` I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">GDR</ENAMEX> 's future as a separately identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Simmons</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> whose book on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> , entitled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Unloved Country</ENAMEX> , '' was published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> .
     Up to now , that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Ulbricht</ENAMEX> to establish the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's international legitimacy , followed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> 's campaign to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East bloc</ENAMEX> 's only successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Stalinist</ENAMEX> economy into a consumer paradise .
     Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> achieved perfection .
     Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> and joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Romania</ENAMEX> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems .
     The less-self-confident <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Czechoslovaks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Bulgarians</ENAMEX> , in contrast , declared their intentions to reform , while doing nothing concrete about it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">media</ENAMEX> soon began presenting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's speeches only as sketchy summaries , and giving space to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1988</TIMEX> , they were banning <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">publications</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> in the bloc ought to travel its own road .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> spoke of `` generally valid objective laws of socialism '' and left no room for debate .
     With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's dislocations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , and the drive to democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> grew still more defensive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Herrman</ENAMEX> confessed to a `` grave concern '' over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> democracy .
     `` Under the banner that proclaims the ` renewal of socialism , ' '' he said , `` forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism . ''
     Some loyal voices , in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> , saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's unrest coming .
     The first signs were economic .
     Despite heavily subsidized consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">industries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East Germans</ENAMEX> have for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> watched the West pull farther out ahead .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time , economic growth came to a dead stop .
     Gingerly , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> began to blame central planning .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> in theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journals</ENAMEX> even raised the notion of introducing democracy , at least in the workplace .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> , an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before .
     But they are stalwart <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX> .
     Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Stalinist</ENAMEX> muck , not to merge with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">West</ENAMEX> .

     He was a `` socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> '' who felt rankled by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's enormous postwar prosperity and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bonn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> .

     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> began assessing the damage from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's devastating earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments .
     `` In terms of coverage , it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Premner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for broadcasting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">King Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , which owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash .</ENAMEX>
     While rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> was broadcasting the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> when the quake struck -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> was unable to get its signal out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX> after the quake .

     With airline deals in a tailspin , legendary Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Steinhardt</ENAMEX> could have trouble parachuting out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only a week ago</TIMEX> , when airline buy-out fever was already winding down , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> was engaged in a duel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir </ENAMEX>.
     He was threatening to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> , after spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 167 million</NUMEX> to build an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stake for his investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     The would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> even hired an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banker</ENAMEX> to give teeth to his takeover threat , which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acquirer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir </ENAMEX>, or for his own stake .
     In fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> was pitted against another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionnaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX> , who bought into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> to help fend off Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Berkshire Hathaway</ENAMEX> , holds a much bigger stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steinhardt Partners</ENAMEX> .
     Now , in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's troubles in financing its buy-out , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> raiding game has been grounded .
     Instead of hoping to sell his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stake at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' estimated buy-out price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80</NUMEX> a share , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> is stuck with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 3.7 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> shares that cost him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45</NUMEX> , on average , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 1\/2</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     `` It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says , though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ' `` operating skills . ''
     At the current price , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> holding represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> of all the assets that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> manages .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A week ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stock briefly soared above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> after a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> might launch a hostile bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> , though takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> say they were skeptical .
     `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> is worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> as a takeover and the stock went to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> , the market was saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> 's presence was n't worth anything , in terms of getting a deal done , '' says a veteran takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculator</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> say this all goes to show that even the smartest money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> can get infected with crowd passions .
     In trying to raid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> abandoned his usual role as a passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , and ran into snags .
     Moreover , unlike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> , who often holds big stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> has n't in the past done much long-term investing .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> , who runs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steinhardt Partners</ENAMEX> , made his name as a gunslinging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , his big losses , for instance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> 's crash , generally have been trading losses .
     So , some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , now is encumbered with a massive , illiquid airline holding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stock might lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> points if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> stake was dumped all at once .
     As a result , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> must reconcile himself to selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> at a loss , or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment .
     `` Long-term investing -- that 's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> 's style , '' chuckles an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who once worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steinhardt Partners</ENAMEX> .
     `` He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole , '' adds another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steinhardt Partners</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumnus</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> has been buying its own shares , as part of a program to retire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> shares , though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> wo n't discuss its buy-back program .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stepped up its share purchases , that might be a way for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> to get out , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Pettee</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> might not want to help Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> , he adds .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Colodny</ENAMEX> stonewalled when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> threatened to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> , a much more practiced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> , eventually sold a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stake at a tiny profit through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> also could take that route .
     He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     However , with airline stocks cratering , he might not get a very good price for his shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say .
     Especially galling for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> close to him , is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colodny</ENAMEX> wo n't even take his telephone calls .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Berkshire Hathaway</ENAMEX> , are pretty strong .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> 's deal with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> has made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> so-called 13D filings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> , as he bought and sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX> to try to scare a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , and to stir interest in the stock .
     But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steinhardt Partners</ENAMEX> to take over a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> wo n't talk about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> at all .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> has great promise .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of 1990</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stock could hit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helane Becker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
     She thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> should buy the stock if it tumbles to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> .
     But meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several quarters</TIMEX> as it tries to digest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piedmont Airlines</ENAMEX> , which it acquired .
     Moreover , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months</TIMEX> .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says he 's `` comfortable holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> as an investment . ''
     While he has bought and sold some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> shares in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , he says that contrary to rumors , he has n't tried to unload his holding .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> adds that he bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> as `` part of a fundamental investment in the airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says he made money trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     Overall , his investments so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> are showing gains of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> , he adds .
     Does Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat .
     `` I do n't think you 'll find I 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Addington Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> said it called for redemption on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 21</TIMEX> its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.8 million</NUMEX> outstanding of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> convertible subordinated debentures due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2013</TIMEX> .
     The debentures were issued in the face amount of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46 million</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 11 , 1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ashland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky.</ENAMEX> , coal mining , water transportation and construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the redemption is permitted because the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Addington</ENAMEX> 's stock has equaled or exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.60</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 consecutive trading days</TIMEX> , a condition set in the terms of the debentures .
     Debenture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,103.11</NUMEX> redemption price .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore International Ltd.</ENAMEX> said it will report a loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     That will mark the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering .
     Commodore , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">West Chester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , had said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next month</TIMEX> .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal fourth-quarter</TIMEX> loss was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</NUMEX> narrower than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> had expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few weeks</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> closed .
     Still , even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989 first-quarter</TIMEX> earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200.2 million</NUMEX> .
     Reflecting concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> 's outlook , its stock has plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , closing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.875</NUMEX> a share in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     The price can be expected to erode further , because the loss estimate came after the market closed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> is close to dropping off research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' market-share charts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> has assembled an experienced management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , it has persuaded many more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .
     But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones .
     In the meantime , the strategies will increase expenses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas -- mainly in getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to use its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Amiga</ENAMEX> , which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> hardware .
     But sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> have become difficult during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past several months</TIMEX> , even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , which has been by far <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> 's strongest market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">64</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">128</ENAMEX> , mainly used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's educational software and games , had surprised market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> has said it expects sales to rebound , but market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off .

     Stock prices closed slightly higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first routine trading day</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's big plunge .
     Some issues were affected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's devastating earthquake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area .
     Activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market 's plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> and its rebound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> began to set their sights on events coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week</TIMEX> .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted through the session within a trading range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> points before closing with a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.92</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2643.65</NUMEX> .
     Broader averages also posted modest gains .
     Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341.76</NUMEX> , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.71</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320.54</NUMEX> and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189.32</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 822</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> issues advanced in price , while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">668</NUMEX> declined .
     But the Dow Jones Transportation Average went down for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> consecutive session , due largely to further selling in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     The average dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.40</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1247.87</NUMEX> and has now lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.7 %</NUMEX> of its value since the losing streak began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 10</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166,900,000</NUMEX> shares , in line with the level of trading over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few weeks</TIMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">224.1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> cited anticipation of the consumer price report for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> 's expiration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown .
     In addition , activity at a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> .
     Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
     The early move essentially established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's trading range , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
     `` I did n't expect it to be this quiet .
     I expected to see more volatility as some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> who were spooked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> did some selling , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond F. DeVoe</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legg Mason Wood Walker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeVoe</ENAMEX> said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline .
     `` I would suspect that a lot of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committees</ENAMEX> are looking into whether -LRB- they -RRB- want to be in stocks at all , '' he said .
     Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would receive as a result of the earthquake .
     But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> would set the stage for an increase in premium rates .
     Issues of insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> were especially strong .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marsh & McLennan</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75 7\/8</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alexander & Alexander Services</ENAMEX> climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Corroon & Black</ENAMEX> firmed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     Elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Re</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86 1\/2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American International Group</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 5\/8</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna Life & Casualty</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 1\/2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 1\/2</NUMEX> .
