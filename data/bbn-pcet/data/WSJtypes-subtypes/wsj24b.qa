     The market for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , practically vanished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Trading ground to a halt as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     Stunned , they watched brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades .
     `` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin D. Sass</ENAMEX> , who manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 4 billion</NUMEX> and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
     This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says .
     Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , crash .
     Simultaneously , it also helped trigger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's biggest rally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> government bond market as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find .
     But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as prices tumbled on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lonski</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc .</ENAMEX>
     For example , the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 3\/4 %</NUMEX> bonds due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2002</TIMEX> -- sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">less than two years ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> -- plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 30 cents</NUMEX> on the dollar .
     But not even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> would make a market in the securities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> of the nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">7-11</ENAMEX> convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> that is strapped for cash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     Junk bonds , which mushroomed from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of this decade</TIMEX> , have been declining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments .
     The shaky market received its biggest jolt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> , which created its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> with junk financing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdales</ENAMEX> department-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> up for sale .
     Now , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ethan Allen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW Services</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">York International</ENAMEX> , that are counting on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 7 billion</NUMEX> of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money .
     `` The music has stopped playing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Harkins</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> in the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy Harkins</ENAMEX> .
     `` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's aftermath , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Douglas Carleton</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of high-yield finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , `` much of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion</NUMEX> forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> withdrew a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 475 million</NUMEX> junk offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX> bonds because potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> were `` very skittish . ''
     The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Penniman</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCarthy , Crisanti &amp; Maffei</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Xerox Financial Services</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> index that tracks the net asset values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> high-yield mutual funds declined for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 17th consecutive day Friday</TIMEX> .
     In a stark contrast , the benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2 1\/2</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 12\/32</NUMEX> , its biggest gain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     The bond 's yield dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.82 %</NUMEX> , the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1987</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Technical Data Global Markets Group</ENAMEX> .
     The yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.7</NUMEX> percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.16 %</NUMEX> , the largest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> decline since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     `` When you get panic in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Ramirez</ENAMEX> , money market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease credit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead</TIMEX> .
     `` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sullivan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of money market research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Any sustained credit-easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dow</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lord , Abbett &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> of high-yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- .
     It was herd instinct . ''
     He adds : `` The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk .
     I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are running scared .
     There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . ''
     Even as trading in high-yield issues dried up over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 billion</NUMEX> of new junk bonds .
     For example , a recent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 375 million</NUMEX> offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Gas Services L.P.</ENAMEX> bonds sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times oversubscribed .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million</NUMEX> offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc .</ENAMEX> high-yield securities sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> was increased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> because of strong demand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> estimates that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> alone , junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.8 billion</NUMEX> of coupon interest payments .
     `` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carleton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't know how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> of orders for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million</NUMEX> of junk bonds sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Minella</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-head</ENAMEX> of merchant banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` When the rally comes , insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will be leading it because they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> to invest and invest they will .
     There is plenty of money available from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to buy well-structured deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are wary of . ''
     But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , casting a pall over much of the junk market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McNamara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of fixed-income research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> , says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> we probably bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new deals , '' he says .
     `` This <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> , at best , it 's in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> .
     And our credit standards have n't changed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> iota . ''
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNamara</ENAMEX> said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     For the moment , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk .
     `` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> cash squeeze and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's subsequent bailout by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia &amp; York</ENAMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> .
     `` That really affected the market in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' ''
     Well before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its worst years</TIMEX> ever .
     Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news :
     -- In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> before it would default on interest payments covering some of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> of speculative debt securities , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> said it ran out of borrowed money .
     -- In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based real estate and financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> bankruptcy law .
     -- By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of July</TIMEX> , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes widened to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5.5</NUMEX> percentage points .
     -- In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resorts International Inc.</ENAMEX> , which sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 500 million</NUMEX> of junk bonds , suspended interest payments .
     -- In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , just as the cash squeeze hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lomas Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> defaulted on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 million</NUMEX> of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> of debt securities .
     Meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     In addition , there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times as many troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> as there were in the recession of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` The era of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Grant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grant 's Interest Rate Observer</ENAMEX> , an early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of the junk bond market .
     `` What we 've begun to see is the damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> of paying exorbitant compound interest .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Businesses</ENAMEX> were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings .
     What we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative-grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds surged in the biggest rally of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fled a plummeting stock market .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond was quoted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 12\/32</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 27\/32</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/2</NUMEX> points .
     The yield on the benchmark fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.82 %</NUMEX> , the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1987</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Technical Data Global Markets Group</ENAMEX> .
     The `` flight to quality '' began late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market .
     Treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Bond prices barely budged until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> .
     Many bond market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> will be closely eying the action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> , which might repeat its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession .
     Prices of municipals , investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> counterparts .
     Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 25\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> point on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.28 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life assumption .
     Investment-grade corporate bonds were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> point .
     But the yield spread between lower-quality , investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened .
     And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> bond offering by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> .
     Despite rumors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TVA</ENAMEX> 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in the underwriting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicate</ENAMEX> said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said the smaller portions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> each of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed .

     Municipal bonds rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 3\/4</NUMEX> point .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987 October</TIMEX> crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .
     Still , the lesson is about the same : On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> , the market was spooked by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     The consensus along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading halt .
     Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> in stalling the capital gains tax cut .
     The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- .
     And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">An hour</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.4 billion</NUMEX> in tax increases without a capital gains cut .
     There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
     It would be a good thing if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> started to decide issues <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-by-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on their individual merits without trickery .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote .
     Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .
     Especially so since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been weakened by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> fiasco .
     To the extent that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's sticky fingers .
     As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KLM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> own interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that fly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> .
     Worse , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has started to jump on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> bandwagon .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberstar</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Public Works and Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> 's aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Air Lines</ENAMEX> bids .
     It would give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">up to 50 days</TIMEX> to `` review '' any bid for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> or more of the voting stock of any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> with revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> or more .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal has problems , and the market loses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points .
     Congratulations , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressman</ENAMEX> .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , remember , the market was shaken by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> proposal to tax takeovers out of existance .
     Even more important , in our view , was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's threat to thrash the dollar .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> is doing the same thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> ; thankfully , the dollar is not under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX>-style pressure .
     Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are in better shape <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> to survive selling binges .
     They are better capitalized .
     They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> promises any needed liquidity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's liaison with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea .
     In any event , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> see stocks as underpriced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago Corp.</ENAMEX> posted a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.3 million</NUMEX> after joining other big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans .
     The parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First National Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48 billion</NUMEX> in assets , said it set aside <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     The addition , on top of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 %</NUMEX> of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> has reduced its loans to such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     Despite this loss , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago</ENAMEX> said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> realized a pretax gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60.4 million</NUMEX> from the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago Investment Advisors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third quarter</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.2 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50.5 million</NUMEX> .
     Gains from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago</ENAMEX> 's venture capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , a big leveraged buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 34 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> 's second bout of general elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> is slated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 5</TIMEX> .
     For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight-year</TIMEX> misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> hitch with a conservative-communist coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> -- there is but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> bright sign : The scandals still encircling former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Papandreou</ENAMEX> and his fallen socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> are like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> buzzing around a rotting carcass .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-June</TIMEX> round of voting , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> gave no clear mandate to any single political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     The ad interim coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side , the center-right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy Party</ENAMEX> , headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine Mitsotakis</ENAMEX> .
     On the other , the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Coalition of the Left and Progress</ENAMEX> -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Euro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">cousin</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Hellenic Left</ENAMEX> .
     The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> -RRB- as common political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">enemy</ENAMEX> .
     The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> and his closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> .
     In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> .
     When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice .
     With regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> 's principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accuser</ENAMEX> remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Koskotas</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Crete</ENAMEX> and self-confessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embezzler</ENAMEX> , now residing in a jail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> 's credibility is , at best , problematic .
     He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points .
     Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> herald his assertions as proof of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> complicity .
     Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 million</NUMEX> of stolen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Crete</ENAMEX> funds and an additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 734,000</NUMEX> in bribes , as contended ; whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> ordered state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> to deposit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 57 million</NUMEX> in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and then skim off the interest ; and , what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> 's cut was from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 210 million</NUMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> pinched .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> were so heavily implicated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> affair that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> voted to refer them to the special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of drachmas</NUMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> funneled into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy</ENAMEX> coffers .
     In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> , not clinching proof .
     On another issue , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> were told how their national intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EYP</ENAMEX> , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> , including key opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> cabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .
     The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .
     The coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> tried to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-16 Fighting Falcon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Mirage 2000</ENAMEX> combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> , produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avions Marcel Dassault</ENAMEX> , respectively .
     Naturally , neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dassault</ENAMEX> could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for services rendered .
     So it seems that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsotakis</ENAMEX> and his communist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chums</ENAMEX> may have unwittingly served Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> a moral victory on a platter : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> 's expense .
     But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> regain power , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> should never be underestimated .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> came his predictable fusillade : He charged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Coalition of the Left</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Progress</ENAMEX> had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> and thwarting the course of socialism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> .
     Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> to stand for election under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> banner .
     Next , he continued to court the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX> -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> 's birth -- by bringing into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> a well-respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> .
     For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> and known political enemy of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsotakis</ENAMEX> .
     Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of its harshest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accusers</ENAMEX> .
     Crucial as these elections are for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> , pressing issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> are getting lost in the shuffle .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NATO</ENAMEX> participation remains unsure , for instance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> 's bilateral relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> need attention soon as well .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , the current accord concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> lapses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1990</TIMEX> .
     Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> elections , but the clock is running .
     Another matter of concern is the extradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Rashid</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> who is wanted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> bombing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan American Airways</ENAMEX> flight .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have decided in favor of extradition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rashid</ENAMEX> case , but the matter awaits final approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> 's next justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
     That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> could win the elections outright is improbable ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> press , previously eager to palm off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> 's line , has turned on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> with a wild-eyed vengeance .
     Yet the possibility of another lash-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is all too real .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> becomes the major opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , he could hamstring a conservative-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">New Democracy</ENAMEX> has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> to negative reaction against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PASOK</ENAMEX> , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .
     As for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> ?
     He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage .
     But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slingers</ENAMEX> who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .

     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's sell-off was triggered by the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's buy-out plan and a big rise in producer prices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials skidded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2569.26</NUMEX> .

     Prospects for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out proposal appear bleak .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> refused to back the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> transaction , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> said it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers .
     The decision was based solely on problems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> management-pilot plan , they said .
     The surge in producer prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> of declines , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were divided on whether the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation .

     A federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ca n't hold corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws .
     The ruling stems from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> suit filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> , claiming that company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> misled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> about the expected success of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa</ENAMEX> computer , introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the `` press defense '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> may become popular as a result of the ruling .
     According to the suit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> created public excitement by touting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa</ENAMEX> as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">first year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> circulated internal memos indicating problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa</ENAMEX> .
     The suit claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> 's stock climbed to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 63.50</NUMEX> a share on the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's optimistic forecasts .
     But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa</ENAMEX> 's poor sales late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , the stock plummeted to a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.37</NUMEX> a share , according to the suit .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> claimed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 150 million</NUMEX> in losses .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's statements by alerting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa</ENAMEX> 's problems .
     Late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> agreed that most of the case should be dismissed .
     However , it gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lisa</ENAMEX> 's disk drive , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Twiggy</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ruled that the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> did n't reveal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Twiggy</ENAMEX> 's problems at the time .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> are worried about the ruling 's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> case .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's statements , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Grannon</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Greenfield &amp; Chimicles</ENAMEX> , which was n't involved in the case .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shareholders</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Milberg , Weiss , Bershad , Specthrie &amp; Lerach</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> petitioned for a rehearing of the case .
     They wrote : `` The opinion establishes a new rule of immunity -- that if a wide variety of opinions on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's business are publicly reported , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can say anything without fear of securities liability .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> ORDERED to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 million</NUMEX> in legal fees to defunct
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Football League</ENAMEX> is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">U.S. Football League</ENAMEX> 's largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL</ENAMEX> 's claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> monopolized major league <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 1</NUMEX> in damages , trebled because of the antitrust claims .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> upheld a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 million</NUMEX> award of attorneys fees to the defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey D. Myerson</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Myerson &amp; Kuhn</ENAMEX> , then of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Finley , Kumble , Wagner , Heine , Underberg , Manley , Myerson &amp; Casey</ENAMEX> , was the lead trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , and his new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> pursued the application appeal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas R. Pappas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Myerson &amp; Kuhn</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5.3 million</NUMEX> of the award goes directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL</ENAMEX> to reimburse it for fees already paid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Myerson &amp; Kuhn</ENAMEX> will get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 260,000</NUMEX> for the costs of pressing the application .
     The federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL</ENAMEX> from being reimbursed .
     Antitrust laws provide that injured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties</ENAMEX> may be reimbursed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' fees .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepard Goldfein</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> , says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">client</ENAMEX> will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldfein</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &amp; Flom</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL</ENAMEX> lost its major claims , including its contention that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> restrained trade through television contracts .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USFL</ENAMEX> was not the prevailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldfein</ENAMEX> insists .

     The affiliation is believed to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such cross-border arrangement among major law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are n't required to refer work exclusively to each other and remain separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> .
     But they will work together on energy - , environmental - and fair-trade-related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibson Gayle Jr.</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">585</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fulbright &amp; Jaworski</ENAMEX> .

     The arrangement , reached after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about eight months</TIMEX> of negotiations , grew out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fenerty Robertson</ENAMEX> 's desire to develop ties with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in light of relaxed trade barriers between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis M.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Mount Lebanon High School</ENAMEX> , near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , sought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million</NUMEX> in compensatory damages from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grace</ENAMEX> , arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> , which can cause respiratory diseases and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , posed a risk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grace</ENAMEX> successfully contended that removing the fire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">retardant</ENAMEX> would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the verdict is thought to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in favor of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">plaintiff</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> in question was used for fireproofing .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts .
     It noted , for example , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.734 billion francs</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.934 billion francs</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said the results signal a turnaround for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced , imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> .
     A new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46 million</NUMEX> steel rod <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimill</ENAMEX> , which got off to a rocky start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1988</TIMEX> , now is running efficiently and a new management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is more heavily marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> 's products , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> expects to report net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.3 milion </NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.53</NUMEX> a share , after an extraordinary gain from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.2 million</NUMEX> in tax benefits .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 million</NUMEX> , including a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.1 million</NUMEX> loss from continuing operations and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400,000</NUMEX> loss from discontinued operations .

     Production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mill</ENAMEX> has exceeded the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> 's casting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> to supply it , he said , which will force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">billet</ENAMEX> , or unfinished steel bars , from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Bowder</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's strong earnings enable it to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to set aside provisions covering all its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 1.17 billion</NUMEX> in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> LDC debt .
     `` It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , '' he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about C$ 525 million</NUMEX> will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter</TIMEX> , ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowder</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 300 million</NUMEX> charge to earnings would amount to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about C$ 1.34</NUMEX> a share .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months ended July 31</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 577 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 3.10</NUMEX> a share .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowder</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> will restructure its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 604 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> debt , of which <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 255 million</NUMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> notes secured by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> government bonds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> reserve against the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 349 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> debt and expects to swap that for other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> notes supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon bonds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowder</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's experience with LDC debt has been `` painful '' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX> to reduce its exposure through provisioning , debt sales and debt swaps .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> will no longer participate in LDC sovereign lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's standards .

     The carnage among takeover stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> does n't mean the end of mega-mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , Wall Street 's big-time deal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Suitors</ENAMEX> from now on are more likely to be expansion-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX> or debt-happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> .
     And they will be launching lower-priced and perhaps fewer deals , now that it 's tougher to finance them .
     This is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that put themselves up for sale .
     Whenever <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> merger boom seems to be stalling , shock waves ripple through the stock market .
     `` The market is overvalued , not cheap , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gaines</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gaines Berland</ENAMEX> .
     He recently began increasing his cash position to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> of his portfolio .
     `` I look at where deals can get done , '' he says , `` and they 're not getting done '' at current prices .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Lenders</ENAMEX> are growing increasingly nervous about debt-financed takeovers , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say .
     `` You had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week</TIMEX> of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran smack into the news on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Rattner</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and merger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lazard Freres &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     Trading dried up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in the market for high-yield junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers .
     It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> hit a cash crunch .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> trying to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that it could n't arrange the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.2 billion</NUMEX> in bank loans it needs to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX> a share .
     Takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> today will be scrambling to learn of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy .
     Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> representing the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a frantic weekend</TIMEX> trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , the target of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120</NUMEX>-a-share takeover proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> .
     Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> shares was suspended shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and did n't resume .
     Before the halt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> last traded at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 5\/8</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> shares at prices as low as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> .
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.1 % and 8.5 %</NUMEX> , respectively , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and could weaken further .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weeked</TIMEX> , however , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> developments in other deals indicated that commerical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> still are willing to commit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> to finance takeover bids launched by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro S.A.</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that it agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anchor Glass Container</ENAMEX> in a tender offer for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.25</NUMEX> a share , sweetened from the original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX>-a-share offer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/4</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     For the broader market , the greatest significance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro-Anchor</ENAMEX> deal may be that it was put together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> -- after the market rout -- and involves a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155 million</NUMEX> temporary `` bridge '' loan from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 139 million</NUMEX> loan from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific National Bank</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , to complete the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anchor Glass</ENAMEX> purchase and refinance existing debt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> said it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> of junk bonds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> 's statement is n't merely an idle boast , because those bonds will have to be sold before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> 's bridge loan can be paid back .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , said it expects to arrange <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 430 million</NUMEX> in bank loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> .
     In another takeover battle , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> has been advised by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> that they remain `` highly confident '' they can arrange <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> of bank loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> 's tender offer for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 45 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> , `` notwithstanding recent events . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> is offering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125</NUMEX> a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares , thereby challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX>-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> 's cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 1\/2</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.9 %</NUMEX> , to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares were n't hurt much because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> is viewed as a well-financed corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> unlikely to be affected by skittishness among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> or bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> interviewed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> see a silver lining for the merger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> in the stock-market drop .
     Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidders</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lazard </ENAMEX>.
     `` Nothing makes things look cheaper than a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>-point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattner</ENAMEX> says .
     `` Just as there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> waiting to become bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in the stock market , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> waiting to become bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in the deal market . ''
     Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> expect most of those bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> to be well-heeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .
     `` In the past , corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , which were often prepared to outbid '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Tomilson Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of mergers and acquisitions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
     Now , `` corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> should be willing to re-enter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbond-financed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers</ENAMEX> has been reduced . ''
     Many takeover stocks plunged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> retained their confidence in corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> but fled from the socalled whisper stocks , the targets of rumored deals .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment</ENAMEX> , which has agreed to a friendly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27</NUMEX>-a-share bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1\/8</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 5\/8</NUMEX> .
     But several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> or more .
     They include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.7 %</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.1 %</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Communications</ENAMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.3 %</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2 %</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.1 %</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.7 %</NUMEX> .
     The market -- and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> -- are even less sanguine about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already .
     Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> fear that these transactions may be revised yet again .
     Examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> , whose agreement to be acquired for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25</NUMEX> a share by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> collapsed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 7\/8</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> , which first delayed and then shelved a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.6 %</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so .
     Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International</ENAMEX> , which agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to accept a lower price from a buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.8 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> .
     The buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> is offering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.50</NUMEX> a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Medical</ENAMEX> shares , down from its offer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28</NUMEX> a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68.8 million</NUMEX> shares .
     But investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say the market may have oversold some takeover-related stocks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Hilton Hotels</ENAMEX> , for example , was among the worst-hit issues , falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.2 %</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 1\/2</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> said over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> that the depth of the sell-off in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> shares was unwarranted because none of the likely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers</ENAMEX> would be dependent on junk-bond financing .
     However , they conceded that some potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidders</ENAMEX> would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> signified a general unwillingness among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they were n't worried about the drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lebo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> 's general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> , said plans to consider a sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . ''
     `` I ca n't believe that any potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> would be affected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day</TIMEX> 's trading , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lebo</ENAMEX> said .
     But the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> , both in the junkbond market and among commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     For debt-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">suitors</ENAMEX> , `` the takeover game has been over for some time , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Capital</ENAMEX> , who has been keeping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of his portfolio in cash .

     Of all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time expenses incurred by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> or professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
     To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> or professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
     It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
     Specifically , it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
     When a regional economy catches <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> , the local real-estate market gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> .
     In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
     This was seen in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .
     Why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
     Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metropolitan Detroit</ENAMEX> was written off economically during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
     Area employment dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> peak and retail sales were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> .
     However , the real-estate market was hurt even more .
     For example , residential building permits in the trough year of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> were off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> peak level .
     Once metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's economy rallied in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , real estate rebounded .
     Building permits , for example , soared a staggering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">400 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1982 and the peak year of 1986</TIMEX> .
     Where , savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are now asking , are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's opportunities ?
     Look no further than metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     Of course , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have touted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years</TIMEX> as a counter-cyclical play .
     But now appears to be the time to act .
     Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> 's economy did drop and then flatten in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> after its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> peak .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , employment was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 5 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> peak and retail sales were off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> .
     The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .
     Office construction dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 %</NUMEX> .
     The vacancy rate soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> in nearly every product category , and more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of office space was vacant .
     To some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> , the empty office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> 's `` see-through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy .
     As usual , the real-estate market had overreacted .
     Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation .
     Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has held steady over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past six years</TIMEX> .
     And personal income , after slumping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , has returned to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> level in real dollar terms .
     Today , metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 42,000</NUMEX> jobs were added in metro <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .
     This growth puts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> metro areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     And forecasts project a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 % to 3 %</NUMEX> growth rate in jobs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years</TIMEX> -- nearly twice the national average .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> .
     By some measures , metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> 's economy has actually improved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years</TIMEX> .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has continued to increase since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the peak year</TIMEX> of the economic cycle .
     Employment is now <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> higher than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> .
     Buying income in real dollars actually increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1983 and 1987</TIMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent year</TIMEX> available -RRB- .
     The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the boom years</TIMEX> , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .
     In a self-fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     Housing building permits are down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75 %</NUMEX> from their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> peaks .
     Although no one can predict when metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several billion dollars</NUMEX> are under way or planned -- such as a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">convention center</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">beltway</ENAMEX> encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as next year</TIMEX> -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .
     What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> 's or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> 's ?
     Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1980s</TIMEX> peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     Vacancy rates in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 19 %</NUMEX> range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> may easily rise to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">low to mid-20 %</NUMEX> range in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> .
     Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and professional service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> .
     Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .

     According to notes taken by one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> at the meeting , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> was gambling dangerously with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depositors</ENAMEX> ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> had complained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> were being too zealous .

     In the midst of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> re-election campaign , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> , returned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76,000</NUMEX> in contributions after a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> had gathered the money for him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about two weeks</TIMEX> before the meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' products being made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Toys Council</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Ting</ENAMEX> , has suggested a new sourcing label : `` Made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> . ''
     The toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> .
     But in the wake of the shootings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> stress that production has n't been affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites .
     The toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , and their foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> , cite uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's economic and political policies .
     `` Nobody wants to have all his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> basket , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Yeh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Matchbox Group Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matchbox</ENAMEX> and other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> were setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> , especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand</ENAMEX> , long before the massacre .
     Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     By diversifying supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> , the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> do n't intend to withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> say .
     It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> .
     A supply of cheap labor and the access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">port</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and support industries , such as printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , have made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> a premier manufacturing site .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South China</ENAMEX> is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hu</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> trade figures illustrate the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> ' reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> across the border .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 10.05 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.29 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     But re-exports , mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 15.92 billion</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 's first seven months</TIMEX> , domestic exports fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 3.87 billion</NUMEX> , while re-exports rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 11.28 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> say there is no immediate substitute for southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 120,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are employed by the toy industry .
     `` For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years</TIMEX> , like it or not , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> is going to be the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">supplier</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Young</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Perfecta Enterprises Ltd.</ENAMEX> , one of the first big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> to move across the border .
     In the meantime , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> .
     Several big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have established manufacturing joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matchbox</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wah Shing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kader Industrial Co.</ENAMEX> , the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> headed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ting</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">the Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia</ENAMEX> also are being studied .
     With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> set to remove its internal trade barriers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are beginning to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> as possible manufacturing sites .
     Worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> came just as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's toy industry was recovering from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> sales slump and bankruptcy filings by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Worlds of Wonder Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coleco Industries Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .
     The industry regards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
     Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's biggest market for toys and games .
     The closest thing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> mega-hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> series of action figures manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates Holdings Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     Introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1988</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">15-centimeter</NUMEX>-tall plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> are based on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> comic book and television series .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kwan</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates</ENAMEX> , says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> have been sold , placing the reptilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> biggest-selling toys in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Should sales continue to be strong through the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas season</TIMEX> , which accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retail toy sales , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwan</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> could make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> a record sales year for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> expect their results to improve only slightly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Besides the lack of a fast-selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo Entertainment System</ENAMEX> , an expensive video game made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> have little money left to spend on other products .
     Many of the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> ' problems started well before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> as a result of overstrained infrastructure and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's austerity programs launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> .
     Toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> complain that electricity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> has been provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">only three days</TIMEX> a week in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five days</TIMEX> a week , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> are upgrading standby power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     Bank credit for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> investments all but dried up following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> .
     Also , concern exists that the harder-line <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> will tighten its control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong</ENAMEX> , which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms .
     But , toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     They say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's trade deficit is widening and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Guangdong .</ENAMEX>
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Playmates</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX> have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Solicitor General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> argued that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade </ENAMEX>, recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect .
     He also argued that the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> was wrong in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> to rule that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX> have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's position was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> abortion cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will hear argued and will decide this term .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> filed the brief in an appeal involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> law that requires that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minor</ENAMEX> be notified before she may have an abortion .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> to adopt a legal standard suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rehnquist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last July</TIMEX> when the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> upheld <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> 's abortion restrictions .
     Under that standard , which garnered the votes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .
     That is a much easier standard for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> to satisfy than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's test since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> , which requires a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion .
     On the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> law , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> said that requiring that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX> to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's permission instead .
     The case , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodgson</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , will be argued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 29</TIMEX> .
