     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Farmington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mesa</ENAMEX> has consistently rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">StatesWest</ENAMEX> 's offers , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this week</TIMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> would n't give the proposal further consideration , calling it `` vague and ill-defined '' because it did n't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">StatesWest</ENAMEX> securities which were part of the offer .
     The new letter purports to do this , saying that in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7</NUMEX> a share in cash , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">StatesWest</ENAMEX> would offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> share of new <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> convertible preferred stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">StatesWest</ENAMEX> it values at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> a share .
     It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">StatesWest</ENAMEX> 's own cash and short-term investments , plus debt and other financing arranged through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hibbard Brown &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banker</ENAMEX> .
     In national over-the-counter trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mesa</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.25</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">StatesWest</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mesa</ENAMEX> to repond by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mesa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Risley</ENAMEX> said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> had received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stateswest</ENAMEX> 's most recent offer and was reviewing it .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel Inc.</ENAMEX> , citing continuing improvement in the apparel market , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> from the soft <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period , on an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> increase in revenue .
     The catalog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> reported net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21 cents</NUMEX> a share , up sharply from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Revenue rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 372.1 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 336.4 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel</ENAMEX> said margins improved because its inventory position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> did n't need the costly markdowns required to trim <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's swollen levels .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the apparel market troughed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of 1988</TIMEX> , then began showing improvement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of last year</TIMEX> .
     `` We 've seen continued improvement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , '' she said .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago quarter</TIMEX> 's results were crimped by expenses associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 260 million</NUMEX> acquisition of catalog-clothing-merchandiser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eddie Bauer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel</ENAMEX> noted .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said ongoing cost-cutting efforts contributed to the latest period 's earnings upturn .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX>-controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     In national over-the-counter trading , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's shares climbed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.375</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel</ENAMEX> 's net climbed a solid <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34 cents</NUMEX> .
     Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> 's results , which were based on roughly equal shares outstanding , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nine-month</TIMEX> per-share figures reflect an increase in average common shares outstanding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51.9 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 million</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Nine-month</TIMEX> revenue was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 841.5 million</NUMEX> .

     The bad news in the junk bond market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW Services</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> of restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> , became the latest prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> to get a cold shoulder from bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     The good news -- to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> of stable credit , at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     Apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston Partners</ENAMEX> , which with related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entities</ENAMEX> controls <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> , had been planning to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.15 billion</NUMEX> of junk bonds , among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gollust , Tierney &amp; Oliver</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> announced that `` in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets '' the offering would be postponed and restructured .
     What was n't mentioned is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> and its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</ENAMEX> , just completed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-week</TIMEX> `` road show '' for the purpose of marketing the bonds .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , at least for now , took a pass .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> 's junk bonds were n't , as junk bonds go , unusually weak .
     Its fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Denny 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hardee 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quincy 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">El Pollo Loco</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` the only significant fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> to specialize in char-broiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- -- are stable , recession-resistant and growing .
     But unless they continued to grow , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paramus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , would have run into trouble .
     Until recently , such buy-now , pray-for-growth-later deals were routine .
     `` But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't buy anything on expectation anymore , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Utter</ENAMEX> , who manages the high-yield fund of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IDS Financial Services</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , '' he adds , `` are getting religion . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> buy-out may yet be financed .
     `` There is nothing wrong with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Tierney</ENAMEX> .
     The rub , he says , is that `` the junk market is n't as deep '' as before .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> 's stockholder meeting was postponed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 21</TIMEX> .
     By then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gollust , Tierney &amp; Oliver</ENAMEX> is likely to contribute <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than the $ 120 million</NUMEX> in equity it had planned on .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> may contribute more senior debt .
     And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> , putting a best possible face on it , asserts that `` very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said they did n't like the credit quality .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> said they did n't think a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion-dollar</NUMEX> deal would trade . ''
     But trading risk stems from credit risk .
     And by adding equity , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern .
     Indeed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> says , in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest `` will meaningfully improve . ''
     As he sums it up : `` We are listening to the market . ''
     What is it , to borrow a term from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> , that so unsettled the market ?
     Some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of previous junk offerings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier , pretax earnings `` would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges , including interest on debt securities , '' by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $ 62.7 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first six months of 1989</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> notes , as many junk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> do , that `` adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> would have run a cash surplus -- in this case , of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> .
     But such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation , taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers , deterioration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and the like .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> envisions capital expenses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 180 million</NUMEX> a year .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> have risen steadily and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wo n't stop eating during a downturn .
     But they wo n't necessarily eat at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Denny 's</ENAMEX> .
     The fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rohs</ENAMEX> .
     Prospective bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and redoing menus .
     `` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> in high-yield debt .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> noted that under the shelved offering , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments .
     Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52 million</NUMEX> a year in interest on cash-deferred , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid .
     The prospectus notes `` there can be no assurance '' that future growth will continue at past levels .
     In the recent past , bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> did n't seek such assurance .
     Now , apparently , they do .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggie Thatcher</ENAMEX> must be doing something right ; her political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> are screaming louder than ever .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher </ENAMEX>, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> encountered it , has made clear her opposition to refashioning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's free-market policies to suit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> .
     In return , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> is excoriated from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fleet Street</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obstructionist</ENAMEX> .
     Well , it now turns out that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had to travel across the globe to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to discomfit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Holy Order of Consensus Builders</ENAMEX> .
     `` A disastrous farce in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> , '' screamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manchester Guardian</ENAMEX> .
     `` She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad . ''
     Egad .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hawke</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> said , were `` enraged . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Times</ENAMEX> said she had `` contravened protocol . ''
     As usual , her sin was saying what she thought .
     She issued a separate statement , separating herself from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> .
     While supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' her statement urged it to `` encourage change '' rather than inflict further punishment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> .
     Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions : In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> a Gallup Poll found that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> , oppose economic sanctions .
     Still , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had once again gone against the grain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir Mohamad</ENAMEX> sniffed , `` If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot , you are out of step . ''
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher </ENAMEX>: `` If it 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> , I 'm very sorry for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> . ''
     If indeed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> opponent that could throw her off political course it is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's mysteriously intractable inflation problem .
     We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> refuses to get along by going along .
     It is refreshing to see at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs .
     Perhaps Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will decide who is right about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , sanctioning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> or running <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's economy .

     After being trampled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's selling stampede , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market dusted itself off and moved on in moderate trading .
     But while the Composite gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.19</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">462.89</NUMEX> , many issues did n't participate in the advance .

     Despite the Composite 's advance , some trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are guardedly optimistic that the market is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> to recovery .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">One day last March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Pilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superagent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Frank</ENAMEX> met for lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lotos Club</ENAMEX> here .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> wanted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 290 million</NUMEX> or more for TV rights to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Winter Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Norway</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said that price sounded fine .
     At that price , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> at the table when negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Olympic Committee</ENAMEX> started in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 23</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Pound</ENAMEX> , a committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> , began by disclosing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> had refused to even bid .
     Then , he asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> to raise his offer anyway : `` If we can have a number that starts with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> , you can have a dea . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> huddled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hallway</ENAMEX> and took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 10 minutes</TIMEX> to return with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> offer .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pound</ENAMEX> responded , `` It 's a deal . ''
     A beaming Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> announced his lastest coup at a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that afternoon</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> grimaced at the price .
     How could <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> get pushed into outbidding itself ?
     Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> , mired in the ratings <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cellar</ENAMEX> and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> from getting another chance to bid .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> had hoped to avoid .
     `` The price of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX> has gone up , '' crows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles M. Neinas</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">College Football Association</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> on a spending spree that may top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> itself could run up losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few hundred million dollars</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities\/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> also risk losses if they outbid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> for other contracts .
     While rights fees head skyward , ad rates wo n't .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers</ENAMEX> already are balking at higher prices .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> are paying too much for rights , '' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Isacsson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Young &amp; Rubicam</ENAMEX> .
     `` If they ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> to absorb the costs , they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports , above all . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viewers</ENAMEX> may not be cheering , either .
     Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials .
     At the same time , some sports events will move off `` free '' television and onto cable or pay-cable , where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's TV <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> ca n't see them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is , can the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> alone make a profit on it ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> , enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> and huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> that might stick around to watch other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> programs when the game is over .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion-dollar</NUMEX> question is , How much are those benefits worth ?
     Some TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do , they wo n't offset the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> deficits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> could run up .
     `` As we 've seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '80s</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Werner </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESPN</ENAMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channel</ENAMEX> , `` those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years later</TIMEX> , in a sea of red ink , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> , '' charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas H. Wyman </ENAMEX>, who was ousted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence A.

     `` They lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one .
     And they 've bought one . ''
     On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just three</NUMEX> big deals -- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympic Winter Games</ENAMEX> in both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> bid a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.64 billion</NUMEX> .
     That 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">well over half a billion dollars</NUMEX> more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> were willing to pay .
     -LRB- After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> will be held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> games in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> games in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1996</TIMEX> . -RRB-
     Now , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> -- a former college <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> who says a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator</ENAMEX> needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX>-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next month</TIMEX> , talks will begin on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them .
     The potential bill : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 600 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several seasons</TIMEX> , an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> jump .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few months later</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 100 million</NUMEX> more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> now pays , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 % to 50 %</NUMEX> rise .
     `` What happens to those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basketball contracts will shape <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five years</TIMEX> of network sports , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lund </ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Multimedia Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.

     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">winners</ENAMEX> will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> , not either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     Nor , by the way , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is an unlikely big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spender</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> had just bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 309 million</NUMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Winter Games</ENAMEX> , he sniped at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> for paying reckless prices .
     `` I love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> , but he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wussler</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     `` And yet his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why rights are so high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> . ''

''
     But the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">49-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is hardly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to ignore the numbers .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> law school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> , he began his career in corporate law and then put in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metromedia Inc.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morris</ENAMEX> talent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> to head business affairs and , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years later</TIMEX> , became its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says that when he spoke out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> , `` I did n't say forever , and I did n't say every property . ''
     The market changed , he adds .
     And he is n't the only big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spender</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 401 million</NUMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Summer Games</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESPN </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities\/ABC</ENAMEX> , will shell out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> , airing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> regular-season games a year .
     `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> say we overbid them .
     Who cares ?
     Maybe we recognize values the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> do n't , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> 's `` Major Events '' strategy jelled after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took over .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> recalls that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1986</TIMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> , he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> train ride back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> and finance , was just learning the TV business .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Five months later</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> .
     Then , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1988</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> gave him one : He bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 243 million</NUMEX> for rights to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Winter Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albertville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> would n't bid even <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> .
     That started the still-raging bidding wars .
     The `` Major Events '' strategy , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says , is designed to notch a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> on the crowded TV dial of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     It 's also a fast fix for an ailing image .
     He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs , grab <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> and tell them about other shows premiering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few weeks later</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next October</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> , for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time , wo n't have to start the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season</TIMEX> against the much-watched <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">National</ENAMEX> baseball league championships and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 've been struggling against that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Rodgers </ENAMEX>, who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WBBM-TV</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> triggers losses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     That is n't surprising .
     Regular TV series ratings have slumped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years</TIMEX> , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says .
     But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % or 40 %</NUMEX> larger than those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> usually gets .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> may help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> move up to No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> 's image .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Winter Olympics</ENAMEX> will air during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> .
     That will please once-grumpy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> -- another aim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> plan .
     They gleefully await the `` dream season '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will air the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> sports events .
     `` It 's made me more committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip A. Jones</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX> 's broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however .
     No amount of hype will bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> back if the shows are weak .
     `` In this market of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> channels , sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESPN </ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner</ENAMEX> says .
     `` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're gone . ''
     During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Summer Games</ENAMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> touted `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Call to Glory</ENAMEX> , '' but the military drama was missing in action within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last October</TIMEX> , during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Summer Games</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> relentlessly pitched a new series , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tattingers</ENAMEX> . ''
     It belly-flopped anyway .
     Moreover , sports is hardly the best way to lure adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> might move up to No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in household ratings , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> buy based on ratings for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18 to 49</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> may remain a distant No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in that regard .
     Nor is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> were aired against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's last-place lineup .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> up against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Cheers</ENAMEX> '' and other shows in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> 's No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> schedule .
     Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited .
     The sports lineup may add <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 % to 5 %</NUMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> profits .
     It alone is n't likely to stop a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> from dumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> shows .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven nights</TIMEX> , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Klinsky</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WHEC-TV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester</ENAMEX> , which dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     `` You 've got to judge where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> will be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> . ''
     The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself .
     And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort .
     On the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</NUMEX> baseball agreement alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> is likely to lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> , contends Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wussler</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Comsat Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional value .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will lose money on <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's too early to tell '' what happens after that , he says .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> expects losses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">all four years</TIMEX> of the contract , he told <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will pay an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 82 million</NUMEX> more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> had paid together -- and those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> expect losses on <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season</TIMEX> .
     Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will air <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12</NUMEX> regular-season games , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> fewer than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> .
     That has outraged some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> .
     It also indicates a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> drop in ad sales for regular-season games -- a risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games .
     If the playoffs end in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-game sweeps , losses could soar .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers</ENAMEX> are resisting higher prices , which would help close the gap .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> signed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> to be the only auto-maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> .
     Price : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 265 million</NUMEX> .
     But ad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> who negotiated the deal say that works out to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 275,000</NUMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> ad in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> less than what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> is charging for the Series <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , `` there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably '' from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> price , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Chase</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bozell Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admen</ENAMEX> , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surges .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Winter Games</ENAMEX> outlook also is mixed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> expects to make modest profits , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> contend that it will take a beating .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Winter Games</ENAMEX> , partly because of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 309 million</NUMEX> rights fee .
     It aired <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">94.5 hours</TIMEX> of mostly live events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calgary</ENAMEX> -- helping raise ratings slightly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> -- but still failed to deliver the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> promised to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will add <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 1\/2 hours</TIMEX> to that load in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events .
     All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Norway</ENAMEX> , so the results can be announced on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 o'clock</TIMEX> news .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> to air <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> coverage plus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 hours</TIMEX> of additional events . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Frank </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> who took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> to lunch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last March</TIMEX> , says that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> loses , say , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> , it matters little .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten million</NUMEX> ai n't jack , man , when you got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> sitting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Management Group</ENAMEX> , citing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     `` It does n't mean anything -- it 's public-relations money . ''
     Moreover , sports has `` claimed its place '' as a guaranteed ratings-getter , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David J. Stern</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Basketball Association</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is n't outlandish bidding ; this is a situation of very careful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it ... .
     I would tend to trust their judgment . ''
     That 's easy for him to say : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NBA</ENAMEX> pact , now at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 176 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> , could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> are completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this month</TIMEX> .
     That would cut into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's slim margin for profit -- and error .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> or so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> takes in the least money in prime time ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> charge <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % to 35 %</NUMEX> more for ads , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Variety</ENAMEX> survey .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> locks up .
     Although sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> predict jumps of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 % to 100 %</NUMEX> in the major contracts coming up for renewal , ad rates may rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 20 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few weeks</TIMEX> of prime time .
     But the savings will be minuscule .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Each hour</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> in prime time will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 million to $ 2.8 million</NUMEX> ; an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour-long</TIMEX> drama costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 900,000</NUMEX> , and it is aired twice .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> may cushion losses with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 200 million</NUMEX> a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     But media-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. MacDonald</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MacDonald Grippo Riely</ENAMEX> says Wall Street wo n't take kindly to that .
     `` On a stand-alone basis , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> ought to make money , '' he says .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes .
     `` What you 're really asking is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> ? '' he says .
     Then , he answers his own question .
     `` Yes , they are .
     That 's the only question we need to address .

     Some would make even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> green with envy .
     Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies .
     And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> of the equipment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> `` monitoring '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have few qualms , right-to-privacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> are alarmed .
     `` New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janlori Goldman</ENAMEX> , a staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> .
     `` Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded . ''
     On the corporate side , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
     The practice is common at catalog , insurance and phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">telemarketers</ENAMEX> , according to trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> and worker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> .
     It 's also widespread for reservations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> in the airline , car-rental , hotel and railroad industries .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Communications Workers of America</ENAMEX> , which opposes such monitoring , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> listen in on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 400 million</NUMEX> calls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> .
     Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> saying they monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Parcel Service</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spiegel Inc.</ENAMEX> , and the circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> .
     Some Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> monitor for recordkeeping purposes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone Corp.</ENAMEX> says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Veritrac 9000</ENAMEX> system , which costs from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120,000</NUMEX> and can record <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 395</NUMEX> .
     Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hiltunen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dictaphone</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of media relations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> recently bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Veritrac</ENAMEX> system , he says , `` to monitor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> cleanup effort . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about four years</TIMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> stress that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> says it monitors bond-trading conversations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to safeguard order accuracy .
     Eavesdropping by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is harder to measure .
     But devices are there for the asking , whether in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> or through the mail .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Counter Spy Shop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , for instance , offers the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Secret Connection</ENAMEX> '' attache case , which can surreptitiously record conversations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nine hours</TIMEX> at a stretch .
     That and other fancy gizmos may cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> , but simple voice-activated tape recorders sell for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 70</NUMEX> at electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> .
     The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases , say private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> .
     While tape recordings to uncover , say , infidelity are n't admissible in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , they can mean leverage in a settlement .
     Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> have proposed laws addressing the issue .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have introduced bills requiring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> be made aware of monitoring .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> bills in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> hope to make such restrictions national .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> monitoring , warning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that they are being heard .
     -LRB- The legislation is similar to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . -RRB-
     Also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Dellums</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , introduced a bill requiring universal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement .
     In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping .
     The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> defeat .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">ACLU</ENAMEX> and worker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> back tighter laws , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> and device <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> object .
     `` I 'm sympathetic with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who feel under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">gun</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Barton</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Direct Marketing Association of America</ENAMEX> , which is lobbying strenuously against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> beeper bill .
     `` But the only way you can find out how your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are doing is by listening . ''
     The powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , which represents many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">telemarketers</ENAMEX> , was instrumental in derailing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> bill .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spiegel</ENAMEX> also opposes the beeper bill , saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Dale</ENAMEX> , center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at the catalog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's customer order <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Reno</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev.</ENAMEX> , defends monitoring .
     `` We like to follow up and make sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale</ENAMEX> , who supervises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bonomo</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nynex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , says the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> needs to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> to evaluate performance during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first six months</TIMEX> on the job .
     `` Sometimes , '' he says , `` we 'll pull someone off the phones for more training . ''
     Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ' for evaluation purposes .
     And in the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">opponents</ENAMEX> , led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CWA</ENAMEX> , say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</NUMEX> of monitored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are n't represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CWA</ENAMEX> claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Nine to Five</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX>-based office workers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> that supports the beeper bill , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six months ago</TIMEX> started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dellums</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loophole in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-party consent law .
     Currently , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> taping is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to the conversation , it 's all right to record without the knowledge of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> on the line .
     -LRB- Intercepting other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> and fines of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     The electronics industry is closely following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dellums</ENAMEX> bill .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> of surveillance gear -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Communication Control System Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Counter Spy Shop</ENAMEX> and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-party law .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vendors</ENAMEX> contend that they ca n't control how their products are used .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> says it has a policy against selling products if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesperson</ENAMEX> suspects they will be used illegally .
     `` Everything sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> has a legal purpose , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Appel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> .
     He says he has n't yet studied the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dellums</ENAMEX> bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . ''
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> is aware that some of its products are controversial .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> voluntarily stopped selling `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">The Big Ear</ENAMEX> , '' a powerful microphone .

     The hottest rivalry in the computer industry intensified sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> announced its first line of mainframe computers , targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> 's largest market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> fired back with new mainframes of its own , extending the long-dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">3090</ENAMEX> line with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 % to 14 %</NUMEX> power boost .
     Up to now , the intense competition between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> sought to exploit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's weaknesses in networking .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's move into mainframes will target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's home turf , where it has a commanding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> share of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , insisted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that its marketing focus would differ sharply from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's .
     `` This is not your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> 's mainframe , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan McGuire</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a whole new generation , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which gets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> its revenue and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> its profit from mainframes , also announced upgraded operating system software that , together with the new hardware , lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> do so-called batch processing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 60 %</NUMEX> faster .
     Batch processing is the high-volume , single-job data processing that most mainframes typically chug through at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , such as updating accounts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">JH</ENAMEX> models will generally be available immediately , though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> wo n't ship until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of next year</TIMEX> .
     Prices on the larger models , which range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 13 million</NUMEX> , generally wo n't change .
     Small models , whose performance increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 46 %</NUMEX> , will carry higher prices .
     Upgrades to bigger models also will be costlier .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX 9000</ENAMEX> mainframes , which it claimed were among the fastest available , were priced from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 million to $ 3.9 million</NUMEX> , sharply lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> models of comparable power .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> models will ship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring</TIMEX> , with the largest following in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> were disappointed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next fiscal year</TIMEX> , which begins in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Stevens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> said he may cut his earnings estimate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current fiscal year</TIMEX> because he had expected at least some mainframe profit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     But he added that he expected to raise his estimate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> at the same time .
     After the announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> shares gained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 89.875</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 103</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> have predicted strong pent-up demand for the new line among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> say the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX</ENAMEX> will let them stay with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> when they need the power of a mainframe , instead of turning to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'm convinced there 's a huge market for this machine , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Smith</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> also plans to compete fiercely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are computerizing new aspects of their businesses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> , however , does n't expect to displace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes that are already installed at big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     In addition to commercial markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market , when it 's packaged with an optional supercharger , known as a vector processor .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay minicomputer line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the proprietary systems that older minicomputers use .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> has staked out a major presence in the booming workstation market , profit margins in that market are much slimmer than for mainframes .
     The slow-growing mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> estimating they have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 12 %</NUMEX> .
     `` Demand for these systems has been very , very strong , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Grabe</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have a good strong backlog for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> even without '' the systems that were announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">3090</ENAMEX> line is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">nearly five years old</TIMEX> -- which is getting up there in mainframe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> -- and its growth is expected to slow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth quarter</TIMEX> is always <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's biggest by far , with most sales coming in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> seek to use budgets before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Cohen</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SoundView Financial Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , said , `` I do n't see that this will be sufficient to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> a significant kick in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has already indicated it will have problems in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> per-share earnings will fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.57</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.97</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     In addition to the new mainframe hardware and software , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> announced a magnetic-tape system for data storage that it said occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as much floor space as older systems but can store <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times as much data on a single cartridge .
     That should help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> address the damage that a resurgent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storage Technology Corp.</ENAMEX> has inflicted in that market .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> seem likely to balk at the idea .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> act .
     But now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has missed the legal deadline for meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> targets , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> continues to work .
     `` If that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill .

     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> said he plans to hold a series of private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> meetings , mostly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> , to try to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> to fall in line behind the tax cut .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> products in what the telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> called a new generation of such equipment are available now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> said , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others will be introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     The products are aimed at a market expected to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> a year in sales by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan Buchner Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of transmission systems for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> .
     The products already available are cross-connect systems , used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment .
     This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchner</ENAMEX> said .
     To be introduced later are a multiplexer , which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line ; a light-wave system , which carries voice channels ; and a network controller , which directs data flow through cross-connect systems .

     Law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines .
     The disarray in the junk-bond market that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> with a credit crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> and the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> has reverberated through some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past .
     Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX> .
     If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do , `` you ca n't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few weeks</TIMEX> from start to finish , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> at a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .

     `` It 's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say the slump , while more obvious in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .

</TIMEX>     What 's more , he said , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed .
     Still , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> as much as domestic ones .

     MURDER THREAT charged in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haas Securities Corp .</ENAMEX> stock-manipulation trial .
     In the trial of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haas Securities</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Laff</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defense</ENAMEX> accused one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> of threatening to kill Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lang </ENAMEX>, filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Lorin</ENAMEX> , told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbroker</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> should be killed .
     The conversation was taped by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> said was an effort to get Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> to implicate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> .
     In his opening arguments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> was the `` real master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX> '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> knew nothing about it .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> was indicted on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> counts of conspiracy , mail and securities fraud , and obstructing an investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has charged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin </ENAMEX>, a stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> , pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> and agreed to cooperate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's investigation of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> .
     During his cross examination of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin </ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 20 , 1988</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Aslanian</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation , also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate .
     According to the transcript , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> should be killed after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aslanian</ENAMEX> told him that information given to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> then repeated the threat , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aslanian</ENAMEX> urged him not to say such things .
     From the parts of the transcript read by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang </ENAMEX>, it was unclear what exactly Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> feared might happen .
     When asked for a copy of the transcript , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas P. Griesa</ENAMEX> had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum .
     During the trial , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> whether he had been so upset `` that you considered killing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> ? ...
     Is n't it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> for this crime was the least that you planned for him ? ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> responded , `` No . ''
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> whether he had taken steps to have Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> killed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> again said no .

     The loss , which is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38 cents</NUMEX> a share , is the transportation services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> setback in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a decade</TIMEX> and compares with net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">68 cents</NUMEX> a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .
