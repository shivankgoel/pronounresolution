     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> has launched a new effort to prove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Palestine Liberation Organization</ENAMEX> continues to practice terrorism , and thus to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to break off talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , however , said they are n't buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> argument .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">forces</ENAMEX> controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> publicly renounced terrorism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 15</TIMEX> , satisfying the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are studying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> list .
     `` We have no independent evidence linking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Fatah</ENAMEX> to any acts of terrorism since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 15 , 1988</TIMEX> , '' he said , referring to the specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> heads .
     `` So far , this list does n't change our view .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> wants to end the dialogue , but our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> take a different view than theirs . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yitzhak Shamir</ENAMEX> 's top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> on counterterrorism , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yigal Carmon</ENAMEX> , was here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to present the report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and others .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmon</ENAMEX> said he also presented the list <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> .
     Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> had provided its correspondent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> with different documents that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> said prove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO</ENAMEX> has been conducting terrorism from the occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">territories</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> said it has n't yet seen copies of those papers .
     `` If the dialogue was based on the assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO</ENAMEX> would stop terrorism , and we have evidence of continued terrorism , what would be the logical conclusion ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmon</ENAMEX> asked .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> has long claimed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat </ENAMEX>.
     It blames most of these on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Fatah</ENAMEX> .
     The new accusations come at a delicate time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> efforts to bring about talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> said it had received a new letter on the subject from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moshe Arens</ENAMEX> , restating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> 's previous objection to negotiating with any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> tied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO </ENAMEX>.
     Deciding what constitutes `` terrorism '' can be a legalistic exercise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> defines it as `` premediated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> or clandestine state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> . ''
     To meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> criteria , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> contended it only listed incidents that involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and occurred inside its pre-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> borders .
     At the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel </ENAMEX>'s report is a list of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen</NUMEX> incidents <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> attributes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Fatah</ENAMEX> , including the use of bombs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">Molotov cocktails</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> rebellion in the occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">territories</ENAMEX> , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> does n't classify as terrorism .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Fatah</ENAMEX> or by any group Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> controls .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> terrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .
     The papers , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> says were discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>-occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Gaza</ENAMEX> , refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group</ENAMEX> called `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Revolutionary Eagles</ENAMEX> . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO </ENAMEX>.
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .

     The dollar finished lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street .
     Concern about the volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock market had faded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent sessions</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , when the preliminary report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> gross national product is released .
     But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to bid the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit lower .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's decision to remain an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> sent share prices tumbling .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</TIMEX> , the DJIA had plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> points and foreign-exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> quickly drove the dollar down .
     When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> below the levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> .
     Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later</TIMEX> trading and closed down by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3.69</NUMEX> points on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar .
     They added that the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency in the direction it was already headed .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8355 marks</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8470 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> .
     Sterling was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6055</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6030</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.57 yen</NUMEX> , down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.10 yen</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Trettien</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banque Paribas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , sees a break in the dollar 's long-term upward trend , a trend that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1988</TIMEX> .
     He argues that the dollar is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> `` moving sideways , '' adding that `` the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> peg the dollar 's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy , highlighted by recent economic data , particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade gap .
     They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and its major trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">partners</ENAMEX> tend to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency less attractive to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Despite several spurts of dollar trading , it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market 's attention .
     Following the dive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks , the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> attribute the mark 's surge to a robust <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> economy and higher rate differentials .
     But , they add that the mark 's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> assets by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> investments .
     `` The question remains : how much can the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> market absorb ? '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satoshi Sumita</ENAMEX> 's reassurance that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark .
     Despite the yen 's weakness with respect to the mark , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say they do n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> to take any action to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> currency on that front .
     Meanwhile , sterling slumped on news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     The news also knocked the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> unit to below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.95 marks</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , but a bout of short-covering helped sterling recoup some of its earlier losses .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> for current delivery jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.20 to $ 370.20</NUMEX> an ounce .
     The close was the highest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 15</TIMEX> .
     Estimated volume was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a light two million ounces</NUMEX> .
     In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 368.25</NUMEX> an ounce .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> , the upper-crust financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> that was rocked by a management scandal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> 's fall from grace is bad news for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> , which has relied heavily on the banking and money management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's contributions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> had an estimated pretax profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 110 million</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> managed net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 96 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> does n't break out the earnings of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> 's performance say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> had profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 17 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , after barely breaking even for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first six months</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , posted net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 106 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first nine months of the year</TIMEX> , down slightly from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110 million</NUMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> downgraded the long-term deposit rating of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , to single-A-1 from double-A-3 , citing problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kriz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Safe Deposit</ENAMEX> 's performance has been hurt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities .
     The mismatch exposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> and continuing into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kriz</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kriz</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Safe Deposit</ENAMEX> `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . ''
     As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he said .
     But he also cited concerns over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's mortgage exposure in the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">New England</ENAMEX> real estate market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> declined to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> action or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's financial performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> -- except to deny a published report that outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first three quarters</TIMEX> ' results .
     An accounting controversy at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of last year</TIMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44 million</NUMEX> .
     The resulting scandal led to the firing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James N. von Germeten</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and to the resignations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early , in an effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Germeten</ENAMEX> , in turn , attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> and accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> of conducting a `` witch hunt . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kriz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears , Roebuck &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> is struggling as it enters the critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas season</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the retailing and financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 257.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> a share , from a restated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 305 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     But the news was even worse for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears </ENAMEX>'s core <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> , the largest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> estimated that sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> declined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , too .
     The results underscore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> 's difficulties in implementing the `` everyday low pricing '' strategy that it adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     Under the new approach , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> set prices that were somewhere between its old `` regular '' and `` sale '' prices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> insist they do n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results .
     Instead , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> blames the dismal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> showing on `` an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods , '' which account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly two-thirds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> merchandise volume .
     The new pricing strategy `` is working , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> asserted .
     He added that , after an initial surge triggered by an advertising blitz in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect on revenue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise it is adding to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two years</TIMEX> in what it calls `` power formats . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> faces an especially daunting challenge on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> shopping season .
     `` I believe everyday pricing in the current environment does n't work , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Loeb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , pointing to soft durable-goods sales .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values . ''
     In what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as
     smoothly as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> had hoped , the
     giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> is now trying new ways
     to drum up business without appearing to abandon its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">seven-month-old</TIMEX> strategy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message .
     In a new TV ad , for instance , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> going through the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> newspaper brands as hype claims by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> that they are offering goods for `` <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> off .
     '' By lowering prices throughout its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , she says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> has the right idea . ''
     But the ad also mentions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> 's sales -- a topic that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> has avoided since switching to everyday pricing .
     `` When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> has a sale at a special price , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in the ad declares , `` it 's something you do n't want to miss . ''
     Recent surveys by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates</ENAMEX> , a market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> is having a tough time attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise .
     The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who said they were more likely to shop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy .
     Moreover , the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> declined to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Just 5 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> mentioned brands in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , up slightly from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 2 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> 's `` friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` The power of price as an appeal , which was very considerable in driving traffic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> , has diminished , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Rosenbaum</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shapiro &amp; Associates</ENAMEX> .
     `` You see some improvement in these other areas , but it 's a very small and slow process . ''
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> said its total revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.18 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.57 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> said claims from the storm , as expected , reduced its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allstate</ENAMEX> is expected to absorb another big hit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> as claims pour in from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the quake wo n't have as big a financial impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allstate</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> did .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX>-on-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products , and partly because of tax changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> that left oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with high inventories in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late-summer\/early-FALL</TIMEX> PERIOD .

     This is in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Melloan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business World</ENAMEX> column `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You Think</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- op-ed page , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 26</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become .
     Unused <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> deteriorate rapidly , affecting the value of nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim .
     At this stage some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just `` walk away '' from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> where the mortgage exceeds current market value .
     But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so .
     The problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments .
     Here are some ideas :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -RRB- Foreclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> could be sold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> for no down payment -LRB- the biggest obstacle to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> -RRB- , but with personal liability for the mortgage -LRB- no walking away by choice -RRB- .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -RRB- Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one month</TIMEX> 's payment -LRB- off the tail end of the mortgage -RRB- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">every six months</TIMEX> paid ; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage -LRB- balloon -RRB- , but `` forgiven '' on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> pro-rata basis as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> remains the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupant</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -RRB- Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">renter</ENAMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupant</ENAMEX> will , in most every case , be better for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> and neighborhood than a vacant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> .
     In this way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> is not dumped on to a glutted market .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Veterans Administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` buying in '' to their foreclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">properties</ENAMEX> -LRB- of which there are , alas , many -RRB- at an inflated `` balance due '' -- say <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80,000</NUMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55,000</NUMEX> -- instead of allowing a free market to price the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> for what it 's really worth .
     Worse , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">properties</ENAMEX> then sit around deteriorating for maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year or so</TIMEX> , but are resold eventually -LRB- because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc . -RRB- to a marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again .

     New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> after shooting up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month before</TIMEX> , reflecting weakening <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> demand after a spurt of orders for new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported .
     Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least three years</TIMEX> dipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 126.68 billion</NUMEX> , after leaping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> pointed to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category .
     That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Kleinman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . ''
     While a decline in orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up .
     Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</NUMEX> , and a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said nearly all areas saw increases , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">tanks</ENAMEX> and communications equipment .
     Orders for military goods usually catapult in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scrambles</ENAMEX> to spend its money before the new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX> begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> .
     While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonal</TIMEX> fluctuations , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
     Without the increase in defense bookings , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> orders would have plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> is slipping .
     Unfilled orders for durable goods rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 476.14 billion</NUMEX> , after declining for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2 years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months in a row</TIMEX> .
     `` It means we 're eating into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bread</ENAMEX> that keeps us going .
     That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleinman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . ''
     Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second month in a row</TIMEX> , posting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 %</NUMEX> drop after a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.3 %</NUMEX> decline .
     Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy .
     But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">both months</TIMEX> orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norfolk Southern Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> authorized the railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to buy back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 45 million</NUMEX> of its shares , which would have a current value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> .
     The buy-back , coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 million</NUMEX> shares , would reduce shares outstanding by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 26 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Norfolk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172.2 million</NUMEX> shares outstanding .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will finance the buy-back with cash on hand , borrowing and `` cash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX> expects to generate . ''

     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term .
     `` The impact wo n't be that great , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graeme Lidgerwood</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp</ENAMEX> .
     That is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said .
     In addition , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lidgerwood</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX> is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income .
     Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lidgerwood</ENAMEX> said .
     Moreover , the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Price </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</ENAMEX> .
     The buy-back `` is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a -LCB- price -RCB- floor , '' he said .
     `` At a certain price , if the management thinks -LCB- the stock -RCB- is cheap , they can go in and buy it . ''

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have given their leading and only credible political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Liberal Democratic Party</ENAMEX> , clear and uninterrupted power for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">40 years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> won by a landslide in the last election , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1986</TIMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">less than two years later</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights .
     The symptoms all point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> does not have a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> still wants to sit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the back seat .
     In a modern system , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's role is to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice .
     It also allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> does n't allow this .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery</ENAMEX> actually is a ministry for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> instead of a ministry of provisions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Health and Welfare</ENAMEX> is a ministry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> rather than an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">organization</ENAMEX> dedicated to protecting the health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> is nothing but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cartel</ENAMEX> for licensed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> , and certainly does not act on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Construction</ENAMEX> spreads <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">concrete</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and boasts in international conferences that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> who spend so much time sitting in traffic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Transportation</ENAMEX> serves the industry , certainly not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who must pay extraordinarily high prices .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> works for itself , supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> 's .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's deteriorating image .
     Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> .
     All this illustrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , and particularly not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
     They serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">industries</ENAMEX> and the special-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> .
     The rest of the world accepted such methods when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> was developing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> put up with it because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> provided job stability and growing paychecks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is not a political <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     It is a bureaucratic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Diet</ENAMEX> plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system .
     Most bills are drafted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> , not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Diet</ENAMEX> does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> are so often opposed to whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> does that it would be a waste of time .
     So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> .
     A recent example is the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> consumption tax on all commercial activities .
     This makes enormous sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , where direct tax accounts for more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .
     If you are a salaried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , Amen ! <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> captured .
     If you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> .
     To correct this inequality , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would have favored an indirect tax , like the consumption tax .
     But the bill was passed without debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Diet</ENAMEX> , in the absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">opposition</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1</TIMEX> .
     They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change .
     All of a sudden , prices were no longer in denominations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> .
     They were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">206</NUMEX> .
     Pockets exploded with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one-yen</NUMEX> coins .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were jingling their change , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> were caught in scandals .
     Money , such as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Recruit</ENAMEX> 's political donations , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , as in the cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sosuke Uno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokuo Yamashita</ENAMEX> , seldom have caused political scandals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Whereas most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals -LRB- though they were furious about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Recruit</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were upset about both and surged to the polls .
     In the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Upper House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> metropolitan congressional elections , in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> won a runaway victory , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> voted , as opposed to the usual <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> .
     It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Recruit</ENAMEX> , the sex scandals , or the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one-yen</NUMEX> coins in their purses , but they obviously were voting to punish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">LDP </ENAMEX>.
     Taken by surprise , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> is busy changing its doctrines .
     It 's now OK to deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     Nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> are acceptable .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S.-Japan Security Treaty</ENAMEX> can continue , sort of .
     And so on .
     Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> has been paralyzed .
     Now is the time to reform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> from a provider , developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern , industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> have the ultimate choice .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">LDP </ENAMEX>, as currently composed , ca n't make the transformation , then it should split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> could stand for consumer interests , small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , free trade and globalism to put <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> clearly among the most developed and open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> could continue on the traditional track of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">LDP </ENAMEX>, representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' preference for larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , control , regulation and protectionism .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> must make a decision immediately ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Lower House</ENAMEX> elections must take place before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     In the current mood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists</ENAMEX> , giving power to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Socialists</ENAMEX> might be good for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">LDP </ENAMEX>, cleansing it of past sins .
     We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets .
     At the most there is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only nine months</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> fuse burns out .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohmae</ENAMEX> is managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKinsey &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Early this century</TIMEX> , diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Namib Desert</ENAMEX> meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> at the beach .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> would crawl in the sand looking for shiny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">stones</ENAMEX> .
     It was as easy as collecting sea shells at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Malibu</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes , searching for that unusual glint .
     But only after a fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</NUMEX> gargantuan earthmoving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> belonging to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</ENAMEX> , the world 's diamond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">kingpins</ENAMEX> , do their work .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">Last year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">43 million tons</NUMEX> of desert were moved from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dune to another to recover <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">934,242 carats</NUMEX> , which comes to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">46 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sand</ENAMEX> per carat , or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">one-fifth gram</NUMEX> .
     Oh yes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Atlantic</ENAMEX> was also pushed back <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">300 yards</NUMEX> .
     `` If there 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> out there , we 'll get to them , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Johns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> 's engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     Here , wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world 's most inhospitable diamond dig , lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">earth</ENAMEX> 's most precious jewel box .
     Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the gentle current of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Orange River</ENAMEX> that carried the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">stones</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's interior , then in the cold surf of the ocean , and finally in the coarse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sands</ENAMEX> of the desert -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> uncovered are of gem quality .
     While other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use .
     Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">vault</ENAMEX> , it has been turned into one .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Months</TIMEX> after railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zacharias Lewala</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> picked up a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamond</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sand</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1908</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonialists</ENAMEX> who controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about 200 miles</NUMEX> north from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Orange River</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">60 miles</NUMEX> inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Atlantic</ENAMEX> -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> lost <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War I</ENAMEX> , they lost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anglo American Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , no one gets in or out of the restricted area without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> 's stingy approval .
     The mining zone has thus remained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most desolate places in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Africa</ENAMEX> .
     Ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> dot the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namib</ENAMEX> dunes , proving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> are n't forever .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oranjemund</ENAMEX> , the mine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">headquarters</ENAMEX> , is a lonely corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">oasis</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Jackals</ENAMEX> roam the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gemsbok</ENAMEX> , hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">antelope</ENAMEX> with long straight horns , wander in from the desert to drink from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> sprinklers .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">most days</TIMEX> , the desert 's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag .
     The wind , stinging with sand , never seems to stop .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> from all parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> as well as professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> 's head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> keep coming .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oranjemund</ENAMEX> boasts attractions besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> .
     There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> video rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">cinema</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> sports and recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clubs</ENAMEX> for everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lawn bowling</ENAMEX> .
     The pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oranjemund</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-hole golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">course</ENAMEX> -- with the largest sand trap in the world .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">Last year</TIMEX> , when the rising <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Orange River</ENAMEX> threatened to swamp the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">course</ENAMEX> , the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> who are pushing back the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Atlantic</ENAMEX> rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood .
     `` Nothing is too good for our golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">course</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony George</ENAMEX> , a mining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> .
     Despite fears the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> may be partially nationalized by the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Namibian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> 's elections freeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> control , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> are working to extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> 's productive life for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another 25 years</TIMEX> , from the current estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> .
     Huge machines that look as though they came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Star Wars</ENAMEX> desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes .
     Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anteaters</ENAMEX> ; a whirring ferris wheellike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">excavator</ENAMEX> , with buckets instead of seats , chews through layers of compacted sand ; tracks and conveyor belts , shuttling sand to the screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , criss-cross the beach .
     Then there is the artifical sea wall , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">600 yards</NUMEX> long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">60 yards</NUMEX> thick , jutting into the ocean .
     Made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sand</ENAMEX> , it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves .
     When the mining in front of the wall is complete , it is moved northward .
     A companion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">jetty</ENAMEX> that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">junkyard</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Engineers</ENAMEX> first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood .
     Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that , inexplicably , held against the waves .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are n't too happy when they see their equipment used like that , '' shrugs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George </ENAMEX>.
     `` They figure it 's not a very good advert . ''
     Despite all these innovations , most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> are still found in the sand swept away by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweepers</ENAMEX> '' who toil in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">excavators</ENAMEX> .
     Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> .
     But should they spy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will pay a bonus equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> its value .
     For these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> 's pay scale , this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">up to 15 years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> do occasionally try to smuggle out a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gem</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wrapped several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamonds</ENAMEX> in the knot of his tie .
     Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe .
     A food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caterer</ENAMEX> stashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">stones</ENAMEX> in the false bottom of a milk pail .

     DISASTER <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">STATES</ENAMEX> are n't jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery .
     Not yet , anyway .
     Just after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> battered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> talked of perhaps adding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX> to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , where earthquake damage may top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> , plans a special legislative session .
     Property-tax relief is likely .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Legislators</ENAMEX> are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deukmejian</ENAMEX> says they should be a last resort .
     Needs are n't clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> think the time may be ripe to revise the constitution .
     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges .
     Policy statement <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-5-39</ENAMEX> sets out terms .
     As a result of an erroneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> levy on a bank account , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> may incur administrative and overdraft charges .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> who has n't refused to give timely answers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> recently amended the policy to cover stop-payment charges for checks lost by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> asks for and gets a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> for a check that it concedes it lost in processing , it will reimburse the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> for the stop-payment charge on the original .
     Reimbursement claims must be filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> district or service-center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> after the expense accrues .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> seeks late-payment interest because of the lost check , you should request interest abatement , publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prentice Hall</ENAMEX> notes .
     JUST <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">FIVE ACRES MORE</NUMEX> are all we need to feel really at home , they say .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> we 'll call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandings</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 800,000</NUMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">15-acre</NUMEX> plot and main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> and have an old <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 175,000</NUMEX> mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage-interest deductions .
     They plan to expand the home site by buying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">five adjoining acres</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> , borrowed against a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> mortgage on the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">five acres</NUMEX> and also collateralized by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">15 acres</NUMEX> .
     Their debt will be well under the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> limit -- on borrowing to acquire , build , or improve a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> -- that qualifies for mortgage-interest deductions .
     As you can guess , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandings</ENAMEX> want to deduct home-mortgage interest on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> loan .
     But , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> private ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8940061</ENAMEX> notes , no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and sold in different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> ; a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> in that old case treat this as the sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> .
     Thus , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandings</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> loan is home-acquisition debt , and interest on it is fully deductible .
     EARTHQUAKE <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">VICTIMS</ENAMEX> facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS Notice 89108</ENAMEX> has details .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice 89-107</ENAMEX> offers added relief for hurricane-hit concerns that must file pension and benefit-plan returns .
     REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> for services must be filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , but do n't bet that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> ' unreported income will be detected that way .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> audits do n't spot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that fail to file the reports .
     UH HUH :
     A claim by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Testa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> paid him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> to go into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44,400</NUMEX> in small bills into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tax Court</ENAMEX> found .
     It held that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Testa</ENAMEX> is taxable on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44,400</NUMEX> of unreported income .
     WHY BE A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MIDDLEMAN</ENAMEX> for charitable gifts ? a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retiree</ENAMEX> asks .
     A retired electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> we 'll call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> works part-time as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , but he does n't want to earn so much that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> reduces his benefits .
     So he has arranged for a university <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">foundation</ENAMEX> to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     He plans to tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to pay certain fees directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">foundation</ENAMEX> instead of to him ; he would omit those fees from income reported on his return .
     So he asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> if the plan would work .
     Well , notes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS private ruling 8934014</ENAMEX> , `` a fundamental principle '' is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it .
     The rule goes back at least as far as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1930</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Willens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> says .
     If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruits</ENAMEX> of your labor , even if indirectly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> says ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them .
     BRIEFS :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo .</ENAMEX> -RRB- moves to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardin </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md .</ENAMEX> -RRB- replaces him ... .

     Blue-chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> have plenty of complaints about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> they advertise in , ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad `` clutter '' and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     Criticism from such big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Estee Lauder Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX> put a damper on the euphoria at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Magazine Conference</ENAMEX> here .
     The conference opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> with glowing reports about consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> ' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Magazines</ENAMEX> are not providing us in-depth information on circulation , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> , in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">panel</ENAMEX> discussion .
     `` How do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> feel about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> ?
     How deeply do they read it ?
     Research does n't tell us whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> actually do read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> they subscribe to . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuben Mark </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate-Palmolive</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> .
     `` We need research that convinces us that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> are a real value in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> 's lives , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are really involved . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> also lambasted the magazine industry for something <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> often are very proud of : the growth in magazine titles during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Lauder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX> , said consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> are suffering from what he called `` niche-itis , '' the increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> that target the idosyncratic interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Niche-itis fragments our advertising dollars , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder </ENAMEX>.
     `` We are being over-magazined .
     We are constantly faced with deciding which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> -LCB- with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> -RCB- we can keep . ''
     He added : `` There 's probably even a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> for left-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfers</ENAMEX> ... but the general interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> is something we all miss , and it should come back . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX> also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elle</ENAMEX> , a fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Diamandis Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> , and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> do n't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     Magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> did not take the criticisms lying down .
     `` We spend a fortune on research information , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Burzon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metropolitan Home</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conde Nast Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> to relieve ad clutter .
     `` But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> would n't think of it , '' she said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Leser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conde Nast</ENAMEX> , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> believe they are getting more for what they pay for .

     Wall Street securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> posted a big , unexpected earnings gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , buoyed by its securities trading and investment banking activities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> said net income soared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 177 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.28</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Revenue more than doubled to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.62 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.29 billion</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said its stock , bond and foreign exchange trading , as well as its investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , were mostly responsible for the earnings jump .
     `` The earnings were fine and above expectations , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael W. Blumstein</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp</ENAMEX> .
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> 's stock fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.125</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.25</NUMEX> a share in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
