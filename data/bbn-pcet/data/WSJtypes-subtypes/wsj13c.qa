     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> .
     The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> avoid disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> charged under the racketeering law , a senior department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> `` not to take steps that would harm innocent <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> distributed the revisions and clarifications to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> said .
     The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law .
     Under that law , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> law has come under criticism from some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> and defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     They argue that the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> not named in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> indictments have been unfairly damaged .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> 's most significant clarification of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> policy is a directive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> that they should seek to seize assets from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> said .
     `` That means that if the offense deals with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , you do n't attempt to seize the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained .
     In general , the thrust of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> 's directive is to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runkel</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> trekked over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few days ago</TIMEX> and volunteered his testimony to fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gonzalez</ENAMEX> .
     It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez </ENAMEX>, who is investigating the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX> .
     But instead of thanks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> was treated with cool formality .
     `` Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> receives a formal subpoena , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> told him .
     Seldom have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> hearings caused so much apprehension in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and political benefactor , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating Jr.</ENAMEX> , principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> 's parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Continental Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz</ENAMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first day</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> 's hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> created to sell sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> is investigating whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> made illegal political contributions .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> arranged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 million</NUMEX> in donations to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and his various political causes , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> more to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> .
     Future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> include a former federal S&L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> who has accused the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> of attempting to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> .
     Unlike many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> says he considers intervening with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> to be improper .
     `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmaker</ENAMEX> says .
     And he has attached himself to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> story tenaciously .
     `` Unless the questions are answered , I will keep on going . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> often are reluctant to embarrass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , even those of opposing political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> .
     In the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Housing and Urban Development Department</ENAMEX> scandal , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lantos</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> grants secured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonse D'Amato</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maverick</ENAMEX> .
     He comes from the same political line as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright Patman</ENAMEX> , a bank-baiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populist</ENAMEX> who chaired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stickler</ENAMEX> for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open .
     Early in his political career , as a city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">councilman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> , he walked out of a meeting when political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> asked that the police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bat</ENAMEX>-roost meeting . ''
     The immediate target of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> 's inquiry is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Wall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> .
     As the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> industry , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> delayed seizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two years</TIMEX> after his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> told him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> was insolvent and that potential losses to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> were growing rapidly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> seems primed to lash out at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> when hearings resume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with testimony by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Patriarca</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> relieved them of responsibility for supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> expressed concern over a report that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> had been summoned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to discuss their testimony in advance .
     `` I think he is trying to improperly influence a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> , and by God I 'm not going to tolerate it , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> , however , is a self-proclaimed `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> '' and former staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> .
     An inquiry into his handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> inevitably will drag in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> others , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sens. Dennis DeConcini</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , Mich . -RRB- .
     They all attended a meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1987</TIMEX> questioning why a federal audit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> had dragged on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> .
     `` I 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names -LCB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> -RCB- will be brought out , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> says .
     This is raising eyebrows .
     `` When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Waldman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Congress Watch</ENAMEX> , a consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` There are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> who will be forced to testify about their meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> . ''
     And a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> remarks , `` I too am astounded by it , because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> has certainly placed a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> in a very bad position . ''
     All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX>-chartered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> with holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> expresses sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> .
     `` He 's wise , he 's good and I know he 's an honest man , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX> says .
     But at the same time , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> has n't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> 's principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake Garn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> .
     They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> 's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> .
     Most importantly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> traded away the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's controversial plan to finance the bailout , which was partly reinstated later .
     At the time , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> said several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> told him that they `` could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garn</ENAMEX> 's insistence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> . ''
     Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway , under the guise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> investigation .
     `` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> concedes .
     Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> could suffer from the fallout .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Barnard</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> re-election campaign while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> was taking his side against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering .
     He recently voted `` present '' when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> to testify , then changed his vote to yes .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> have the upper hand as federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> press a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> fraud suit against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and others .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Leach</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> -RRB- says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds : `` The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Watergate</ENAMEX> in the making . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> set to testify on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> was quoted in a news report over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> as saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Crawford </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's chief state thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> , denies saying that .
     `` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , '' he said in a telephone interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But he said he is prepared to testify that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> and its parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> also has summoned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Gray</ENAMEX> .
     He has characterized the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> ' roles as `` tantamount to an attempt to subvert the ... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even though the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> have disputed his account of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> meeting .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> must brace themselves .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> , as he returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> trip to inspect earthquake damage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , sighed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> : `` Well , back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Keatingland</ENAMEX> .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Volokh</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> immigrated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">14 years ago</TIMEX> , they started life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 400</NUMEX> .

     Not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> way .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three months</TIMEX> after she arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">L.A.</ENAMEX> she spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120</NUMEX> she did n't have for a hat .
     -LRB- `` A turban , '' she specifies , `` though it was n't the time for that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">14 years ago</TIMEX> .

     Most recently , she has become the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Movieline</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">four-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> that began national distribution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , with an initial press run of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> copies .

     Though Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> , she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> .
     Certainly life for her has changed considerably since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kiev </ENAMEX>, when she lived with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> , her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/2</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> in what she calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> , for example , she owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hats .
     However , she remembers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the lean years</TIMEX> and recalls with relish wearing her first major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> purchase -- that turban <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years later</TIMEX> and having a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> boutique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> ask her if it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chanel</ENAMEX> .
     With obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : `` No darling , I just give it a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chanel</ENAMEX> look . ''
     She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> snapshots to the outside of each hatbox .
     Are the hats merely part of her new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">L.A.</ENAMEX> persona , along with the many ultra-thin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capri</ENAMEX> cigarettes she smokes , the parties she throws for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , the Chekovian feasts she offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> at her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekend</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">place</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> ?

     That done , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , business , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> culture , human nature , and parties .
     `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">shashlik</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` a little well done , but very good '' -RRB- .

     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> sees her party-giving as an important part of business .
     She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , but prefers more intimate gatherings .
     `` At <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> cocktail parties everyone 's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next .

     They eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain their clips .
     `` It 's very revealing and soul baring , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> .
     The idea for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Movieline</ENAMEX> actually was dreamed up by an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokhs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Krutchensky</ENAMEX> -LRB- who has the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-publisher</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie Halpern Smith</ENAMEX> , now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-editor</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krutchensky</ENAMEX> approached Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> about backing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publication</ENAMEX> , which started out as a listing guide .
     She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> does n't believe in blandness , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> .
     `` She wants things to be exciting .

     She 'll think of an idea the editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think is impossible , then she 'll have us make it work . ''
     In fact , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> was n't just a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who needed a hobby .
     Back in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> she was a respected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> , writing a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> column about the national cuisine for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunday Izvestia</ENAMEX> .
     Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sovietized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meals</ENAMEX> -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Art of Russian Cuisine</ENAMEX> , '' brought out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan Publishing Co</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't trust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do n't eat , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> , though she herself stopped eating lunch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> to drop <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">25 pounds</NUMEX> .

     In life , she offers practical dieting advice : `` Divide your meals into important and unimportant .
     In a great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">restaurant</ENAMEX> , do n't deprive yourself .
     The other meals do n't matter . ''
     Amusing as she is , and frivolous as she can seem , this is a serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with some difficult memories .
     She was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of relative privilege .
     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> ; her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was `` the eternal vice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` I emigrated to wear better hats , do better parties , '' she said with a giggle .
     `` But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one .
     You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances .
     One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . ''
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> , after their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was born , it had become clear to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir </ENAMEX>, a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> , that they wanted to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R</ENAMEX> .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> quit her job , to remove herself from the public eye .
     The wait was miserable .
     Before granting Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> a visa , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> required her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to obtain permission from her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , whom she had divorced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">38 years earlier</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> was fired from his job , and had to endure <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of organized verbal abuse from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokhs</ENAMEX> were afraid that they 'd end up like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX> to shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> .
     They did n't .
     Their visa came in relatively short order , and they moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> soon found work in his field , but Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> refused the obvious and available occupation - as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> who spoke fluent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
     `` That 's always looking back , '' she said .
     `` I wanted to be in business . ''
     On the way to that goal , she received her first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> paycheck for proofreading a book of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> poetry , attended secretarial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , then went to work for a fund-raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> .
     Soon she was running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     When her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> founded their computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vesoft</ENAMEX> , she worked as business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookkeeper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publicist</ENAMEX> .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Movieline</ENAMEX> is located in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vesoft</ENAMEX> .
     `` Things work out unexpectedly in life , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> .

     `` It 's an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrester</ENAMEX> says .
     `` We are not trying to encourage everyone . ''
     Undeterred by such words of caution , corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> is flocking to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , lured by a huge untapped market and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's attempt to overhaul the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy .
     Doing business with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> , once the pursuit of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handful</ENAMEX> of hardened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> , has become the goal of such major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> , as well as a cluster of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Reflecting the new-found interest , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are taking part in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> exhibition organized by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrester </ENAMEX>'s trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     But while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest may be big and growing , the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating .
     Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> , Western business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> must now grapple with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> linked to perestroika , the restructuring of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's moves to break up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities .
     Changing legislation has opened the field to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> , many who promise more than they can deliver .
     And some foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">republics</ENAMEX> .
     `` You have to go out to all your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H.

     As part of that attempt , by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Trade Consortium</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giffen</ENAMEX> says he spends a lot of time lobbying .
     Growing public fears about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> environment is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new factor affecting some joint-venture plans .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> have been talking to international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Occidental Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Combustion Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Montedison S.p.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     The plans have come under fire from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped .
     Whatever the difficulties , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> remains committed to increasing foreign trade .
     For political as well as economic reasons , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are at the top of his priorities -- a point he underscored by spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> walking around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade show <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     Talking to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> afterwards , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> appeared impatient for a big expansion in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> trade , which now amounts to a meager <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> ranks <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> that have concluded joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> , behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Finland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> .
     According to several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> present at the meeting , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , possibly at his next summit meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     Judging by the crush at the exhibition , deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are more than ready for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> products .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lined up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> stand to receive a free tube of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toothpaste</ENAMEX> , a commodity in chronically short supply here .
     And unruly crowds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">booth</ENAMEX> almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Camel</ENAMEX> cigarette sticker .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> products are filtering into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> market under an emergency import program .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> have received big orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toothpaste</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soap</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergents</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Trade Consortium</ENAMEX> says it is planning to ship <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 500 million</NUMEX> of consumer goods , financed by bank credits , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first few months of next year</TIMEX> .
     But the current <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> purchasing spree may be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time affair .
     The goal of most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -- joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> -- remains elusive .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> ruble is n't convertible into dollars , marks and other Western currencies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that hope to set up production <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction .
     International competition for the few <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however .

     Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giffen </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Trade Consortium</ENAMEX> , which comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ENAMEX> , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> oil project .
     Several medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Abbott Laboratories</ENAMEX> intend to pursue a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> approach .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Shareholders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p.A.</ENAMEX> voted to accept a bid of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,500 lire</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.03</NUMEX> -RRB- a share by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Agricole</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.32 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , rejecting an earlier , equal offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A</ENAMEX> .
     The move will give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nuovo Banco</ENAMEX> a badly needed foreign presence , and make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Agricole</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nuovo Banco</ENAMEX> will become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's biggest private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> when it completes its scheduled merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banca Cattolica del Venetoen</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Agricole</ENAMEX> asked a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> to sequester the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nuovo Banco</ENAMEX> shares , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ANSA</ENAMEX> reported .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">tribunal</ENAMEX> is scheduled to rule on the request <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     No reason for the request was given .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Agricole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> could n't be immediately reached for comment .

     The linkup with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Agricole</ENAMEX> will give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nuovo Banco</ENAMEX> its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Ambrosiano</ENAMEX> , which collapsed amid scandal after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Calvi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">41-year-old</TIMEX> former newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , said in a statement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> will sell its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> stake in its upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resorts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> .
     The sales are expected to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 600 million Australian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 462.2 million</NUMEX> -RRB- , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> has n't disclosed its borrowings , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> estimate the company 's debt at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> .
     He said the move will `` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , '' but he did n't provide details of the merger .
     Company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> 's bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , including a failed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> plan to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , movie and television production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> and force it to sell assets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's latest moves were disclosed after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Australian Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> suspended trading in shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Ltd.</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry .
     It said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> owes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 38.1 million</NUMEX> in loans not secured by specific assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> also said it has an investment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 83.3 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> shares .
     In the statement , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said that on the basis of current interest rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about A$ 120 million</NUMEX> a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resorts</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nippon Shinpan Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui & Co.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 433 million</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's statement did n't say whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> 's remaining stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resorts</ENAMEX> .

     The shares traded at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about A$ 1.50</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , when the plan to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> was announced .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Ltd.</ENAMEX> shares sank to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 1.50</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 3.05</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> 's statement cited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than A$ 200 million</NUMEX> .
     They were what he called an `` unlawful termination '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> of the acquisition agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> , high <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> interest rates , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' strike at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> that cut revenue at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resorts</ENAMEX> and delays in completing a sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regional TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Queensland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> has sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> has threatened a countersuit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> has n't yet reported results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year ended July 31</TIMEX> .
     In his statement , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said preliminary accounts showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 170 million</NUMEX> . ''
     He gave no further details .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shareholders</ENAMEX> ' funds as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 31</TIMEX> were estimated at more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 1 billion</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 725 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will make `` adequate provisions '' to cover costs of the dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> and any loss from the investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> , he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> also disclosed a disagreement among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> over certain fees claimed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Group Management Services Pty.</ENAMEX> , a management-services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have an interest .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> paid the management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 32.6 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest fiscal year</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said most of the money went to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and others for management services .
     Non-executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> , who must approve payments to the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , balked at the amount .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> resigned , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said , so the payments have n't yet been approved .

     Chip 's Memory Is Here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , Here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX>
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TWO</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">COMPANIES</ENAMEX> plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's most widely used data-storing chips have `` volatile '' memories -- their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity , so they need external power supplies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX> and a start-up named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramtron Corp.</ENAMEX> plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least 10 years</TIMEX> without any current flowing to them .
     The chips use materials , such as lead zirconate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">titanate</ENAMEX> , to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Developers</ENAMEX> caution that broad applications are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years</TIMEX> away because the technology is n't fully refined .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramtron</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo.</ENAMEX> , plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Semiconductor</ENAMEX> is getting ferroelectric technology from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Krysalis Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National</ENAMEX> says it agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Krysalis</ENAMEX> 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">4-kilobit</NUMEX> memory , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market .
     In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips .
     Military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> have shown interest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National</ENAMEX> says , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation .
     And while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .
     Showing Up in Court Without Being There
     AN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">AUSTIN</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> plans to make it easy for you show up in court <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a thousand miles</NUMEX> away without leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witnesses</ENAMEX> often must travel long distances to give face-to-face depositions before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     That means huge travel bills .
     And telephone or videotape depositions just do n't match physical encounters .
     That could change , thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Video Telecom Corp.</ENAMEX> , which markets videoconferencing systems , is working with court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> installed a prototype system that connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> over digital phone lines .
     And it is preparing to set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> where court-reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> can tie conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> into the network .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> should make things easier and cheaper .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> will be able to use the network for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hourly</TIMEX> fee of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 200 and $ 400</NUMEX> , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> in any of the connected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .

     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's electronics industry when it accused <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Samsung Electronics Co.</ENAMEX> of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips .
     -LRB- A settlement was reached but was n't made public . -RRB-
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> went on the offensive against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> with a suit charging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">MC88200</ENAMEX> chip infringes on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> patent .
     Another recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> suit accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> of reverse engineering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology -- a turnabout from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> of champion reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> .
     The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is starting to take .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> for patent violation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> charges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> `` has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> patents '' used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">MC68030</ENAMEX> microprocessor chip .
     Translation : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> appears to have taken a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology that is patented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> says , and `` tried to make it look like a new technology . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> either denied or would n't comment on the various charges .
     Odds and Ends
     COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sharp Corp</ENAMEX> .
     They mimic the brain by `` looking '' at an image , extracting the fundamentals -- boundaries , corners and lines -- and translating them into computer data .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sharp</ENAMEX> says the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features ... .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">N.V . Philips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> has created a computer system that processes video images <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> times faster than conventional systems .
     Using reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , chips made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intergraph</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Huntsville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ala.</ENAMEX> , the system splits the image it `` sees '' into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> digital representations , each processed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chip .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> , citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods , said net income dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     The results , which represented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fifth consecutive quarter</TIMEX> of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> , disappointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> 's stock fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.375</NUMEX> a share to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     Net for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">73 cents</NUMEX> a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 64.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86.3 million</NUMEX> shares outstanding at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 986 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 937 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> said consumer electronics sales at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> continues to be lackluster , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Telzrow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eppler , Guerin & Turner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grid Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , which sells computers to bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> . ''
     Sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio Shack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than a year</TIMEX> grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , he said .
     As a result , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Telzrow</ENAMEX> said he cut his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> per-share earnings estimate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.05</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.20</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 88.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.64</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended June 30</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Bryant</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1,000</NUMEX> , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> hope all those moves will combine to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> 's results improve in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the important Christmas quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` They 've been promising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % to 15 %</NUMEX> growth based on the strategic moves they 've made , '' he said .
     `` If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
