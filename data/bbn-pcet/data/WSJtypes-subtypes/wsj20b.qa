     Instead , network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say , it may `` counterprogram '' with shows for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that is virtually ignored in that time period : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> .
     `` There is talk of some revamping and we 're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph S.

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Tartikoff</ENAMEX> , who declined to be interviewed , is `` looking at options <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> and may put some things into the schedule by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-season</TIMEX> . ''
     He declined to elaborate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> 's options could range from news-oriented programming to sports shows , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> declined to comment .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> program will be repeated with updates throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> .
     `` We feel there is an opportunity for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that is not being served by any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> , so we want to take the lead , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KCRA</ENAMEX> 's general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kueneke</ENAMEX> .

     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> will `` closely monitor '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> situation , and says it is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> to defect .

     The youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> programming is no longer dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> .
     There has been a surge in syndicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's shows to independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> , as well as competition from videocassettes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and from cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nickelodeon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney Channel</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> has its highest ratings , outside of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">prime time</TIMEX> , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> version of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Today</ENAMEX> , '' which is produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> .

     Animated shows , which are made by outside production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300,000</NUMEX> per episode .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said , it was hurt by higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous-year</TIMEX> costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Incrementally higher production of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rohm & Haas</ENAMEX> net totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.33</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 187.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.82</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .

     This is written to correct a misquotation in your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 3</TIMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs</ENAMEX> . ''
     In this article , I was alleged to have said , `` Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with high-risk colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy . ''
     I did n't say this , and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote .
     I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">levamisole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">5-fluorouracil</ENAMEX> , to any of my colon-cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> .
     With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> -- but this leaves the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> who are dying of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     This is not nearly good enough .
     I believe any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who truly cares about cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> , both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , should offer the hope of something better than that .
     My statement , read verbatim from a printed text available to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> attending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> news conference , was the following : `` New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results .
     These research protocols offer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> not only the very best therapy which we have established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> but also the hope of something still better .
     I feel any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity . ''
     We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years immediately ahead</TIMEX> .
     This hope , however , will never be realized if we use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">levamisole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">5-fluorouracil</ENAMEX> as a stopping point .

     The oil and auto industries , united in their dislike of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's proposal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> that run on alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> , announced a joint research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">program</ENAMEX> that could turn up a cleaner-burning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> petroleum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> for reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> ' air-pollution problems , with no bias toward any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> in particular .
     However , their search notably wo n't include natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> or pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">methanol</ENAMEX> -- the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> front-running alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> -- in tests to be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next summer</TIMEX> .
     Instead , the tests will focus heavily on new blends of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> , which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Environmentalists</ENAMEX> criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">program</ENAMEX> as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> proposal to require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> a year that run on cleaner-burning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> .
     While major oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have been experimenting with cleaner-burning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline blends</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> , only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX> is now marketing a lower-emission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> currently running on leaded fuel .
     The initial <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">program</ENAMEX> will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasolines</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Colucci</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">lubricants</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratories</ENAMEX> .
     It will compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> different blends of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasolines</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mixtures of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 85 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">methanol</ENAMEX> .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of research , which is still being planned , will test reformulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasolines</ENAMEX> on newer engine technologies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> being developed for use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     There was no cost estimate for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase .
     `` The whole idea here is the automobile and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have joint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith McHenry</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of technology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hawkins</ENAMEX> , an environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> , said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> .
     Oil and auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> supported a move on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to gut Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's plans to require <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> to begin selling alternative-fueled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> .

     He made his comments before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> created to sell sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> , has studied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> 's examination reports by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .

     The bankruptcy filing , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has charged in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> civil lawsuit , was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> 's treatment by former thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">regulators</ENAMEX> , in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> who received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousands of dollars</NUMEX> in campaign contributions from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>.
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , for example , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis DeConcini</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48,100</NUMEX> in contributions from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating </ENAMEX>, phoned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> to request that he push for a sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> before it would be seized .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that he pushed for the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> because `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> jobs -LCB- at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> -RCB- were on the line .

     At the hearing , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> has already pumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 729 million</NUMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> for liquidity .
     He also held out little hope of restitution for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> subordinated debt .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> ' creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , unhappy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings , asked its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> of the accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ernst & Young</ENAMEX> and the securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> , hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> to consult on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's financial plans , told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> in a private meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> ' approval .
     According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> present at the meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . ''
     Asked about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> ' reports , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said `` we totally disagree . ''
     She said they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base . ''
     At a later news conference here , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lorenzo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled .
     He insisted , as he has before , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> would be paid in full under the plan .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> made no mention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> ' negative response to his plan .
     `` We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he added .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> agreed on a reorganization plan that called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> its former size .
     But after selling off pieces such as its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shuttle</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">hub</ENAMEX> and various <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> hit a stumbling block .
     It could n't sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> routes , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the major assets marked for disposal .
     Those routes , valued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 400 million</NUMEX> , were to be sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last-minute</TIMEX> snag in negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , over an unrelated lawsuit between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American</ENAMEX> and another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , caused the deal to collapse .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization .
     It also would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> a bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan .
     Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> would have to be revamped .
     Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> has been negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> over revisions , but the creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> has been having problems with the revisions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> it calls on to analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plans .
     Both said the new plan would n't work .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ernst & Young</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's session .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> would miss the same mark by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 million to $ 135 million</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">source</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> said they expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .
     Other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> has an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> .
     At the news conference , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Bakes</ENAMEX> presented a far rosier assessment .
     Flanked by flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and gate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats .
     Starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> will begin flying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">775</NUMEX> flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> instead of the previously announced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> , they said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakes</ENAMEX> declined to give out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> losses , but said he did n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow .
     These accounts hold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred million dollars</NUMEX> , primarily from asset sales .
     The plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> hopes to pursue , he said , calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> to have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 390 million</NUMEX> in cash by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> .
     Both he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> predicted that plan might be confirmed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .
     As to negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> said in remarks after the conference `` we 'll have to see how they -LCB- talks -RCB- come along . ''
     However , he added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .
     It must be accepted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> . ''
     Under bankruptcy law , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan .
     That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> are free to press for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> approval of their own plan , or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> could ignore both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> and draw its own .
     In any event , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the case question whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> will act by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> as forecast by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakes</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> sought bankruptcy-law protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few days</TIMEX> after a crippling strike began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 4</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> the reorganization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> is pursuing would create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 % to 90 %</NUMEX> of the size of the pre-bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> .
     He projected it would be operating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</NUMEX> flights a day by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late spring</TIMEX> , only slightly fewer than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's old volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,050</NUMEX> a day .

     HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> are weakening .
     The method of calculating the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> tax , paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way , is due for a change in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , thanks to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> 's tax act .
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity ; they have been trying to head it off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> backed a simplification plan in the pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser .
     Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> 's stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning .
     `` We hear it has low priority on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> side , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Starr</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CPAs</ENAMEX> .
     If the law is n't changed , he says , `` we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement , because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> still could resolve the issue with other legislation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> or next , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> adds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">HUGO</ENAMEX> 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds .
     This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> as disaster areas , as well as regions so designated after other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> disasters .
     It lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> elect to deduct casualty losses on either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> or amended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 16</TIMEX> to choose .
     Amending a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> return to claim a refund brings cash faster ; but for personal losses , there are other factors to consider , notes publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prentice Hall</ENAMEX> .
     A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> and that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> 's total losses exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of adjusted gross income ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> may pick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> when income is lower and deductions higher .
     In filing an original -LRB- not amended -RRB- return , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately .
     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> DELAYS several deadlines for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     Returns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> filing extensions were due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> '' and postmarked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 16</TIMEX> .
     Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> or less of the liability .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS Notice 89-136</ENAMEX> describes this and other deadline relief for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .

     Excise-tax returns due by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 30</TIMEX> may be delayed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 16</TIMEX> .
     Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment-tax returns due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> or for depositing withheld taxes , but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> had no proof ; but testimony of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stepmother</ENAMEX> about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-employer</ENAMEX> about his honesty and habits satisfied a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income , so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX> rejected its claims .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay Peterson</ENAMEX> mounts her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bicycle</ENAMEX> and grinds up yet another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> .
     After a tortuous climb , she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista : a glade of golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">aspens</ENAMEX> under an azure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Indian-summer</TIMEX> sky .
     This place is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">12 miles</NUMEX> into the back country -- a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">day-long</TIMEX> trudge for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hiker</ENAMEX> , but reached by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> others in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a mere two hours</TIMEX> of pedaling fat-tired mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> .
     `` This , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson </ENAMEX>, `` is what it 's all about . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">Twelve hundred miles</NUMEX> away , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rangers</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Napa County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This summer</TIMEX> , speeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> were blamed for an accident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Napa County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> , in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> -- spooked on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trail</ENAMEX> that was closed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> -- broke its leg .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> had to be destroyed ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> fled and were never found .
     In numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">parks</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rangers</ENAMEX> have been forced to close <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trails</ENAMEX> , set up speed traps and use radar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">guns</ENAMEX> to curb fast and reckless riding .
     They have even sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopters</ENAMEX> in pursuit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equestrians</ENAMEX> complained they were being driven from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trails</ENAMEX> .
     `` We were being overrun , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Fiala</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trails</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bay Regional Park District</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , the district decided to limit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> to fire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> in its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">65,000 hilly acres</NUMEX> .
     From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years ago</TIMEX> , the number of mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is expected to grow to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least half</NUMEX> that growth will have come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> alone .
     The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bicycles</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bikers</ENAMEX> -- many of them ardent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> -- proclaim their sport an efficient , safe , fitness-promoting way to get back to nature , while asserting a right , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> , to pedal on public lands .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> ' burgeoning numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas , from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Sierras</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Seaboard</ENAMEX> , to ban them from the back country .
     Key to the issue is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> , in skillful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> of terror .
     An adept <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bicyclist</ENAMEX> can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance .
     Such skills allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">up to 40 miles an hour</NUMEX> -- a thrill for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclist</ENAMEX> but a nightmare for unsuspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equestrians</ENAMEX> .
     For harried public-land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , the response is increasingly to shut the gates .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , following the lead of some regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">parks</ENAMEX> , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">paths</ENAMEX> in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">parks</ENAMEX> to mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bicycles</ENAMEX> .
     The move largely consigns them to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> used by motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .
     Most other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have enacted similar bans .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> are unwelcome on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trails</ENAMEX> in national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">parks</ENAMEX> .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Forest Service</ENAMEX> , whose lenient `` multiple-use '' philosophy permits motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">thousands of miles</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trails</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , has begun to close some lands to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> , including major portions of the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Pacific Crest Trail</ENAMEX> , which stretches from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> , the politically potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> among them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sierra</ENAMEX> has been instrumental in securing a number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> bans .
     It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal , pushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> bike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cycles</ENAMEX> in federally designated wilderness areas , where they are now prohibited .
     Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sierra</ENAMEX> 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> , which estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> own mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> .
     Pressure from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">club</ENAMEX> recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no longer , for example , lumps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> into the same category as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">motorcycles</ENAMEX> and other terrain-marring off-road <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">club</ENAMEX> still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> unless studies indicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> wo n't injure the environment or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> .
     `` I have a mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> , yet as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hiker</ENAMEX> I 've been run off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> careening down a fire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trail</ENAMEX> on them , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Coan</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sierra</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , echoing the concerns of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who feel that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX> should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Langton </ENAMEX>, associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mountain and City Biking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Canoga Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langton</ENAMEX> is among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> who got their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> taste of wilderness as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX> .
     He says fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> ; many are appalled that the conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> would suddenly consider them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> .
     To fight back , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langton</ENAMEX> are forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> to lobby land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> can responsibly share trails .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langton </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association</ENAMEX> , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Santa Monica Mountain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">trails</ENAMEX> designated for closing .
     Biking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Montana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Idaho</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> have won similar concessions , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Blumenthal</ENAMEX> , mountain bike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bicycling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> have been trying to improve the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biker</ENAMEX> 's image ; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-area park district where a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranger</ENAMEX> was clobbered by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> have formed a volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrol</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rangers</ENAMEX> enforce regulations , and to school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> in proper trail etiquette .
     Even staunch anti-bike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sierra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> concede that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> cause most of the problems .
     While some are renegade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> who simply scorn regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through `` education and peer pressure , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hasenauer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Mountain Biking Association</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think we 're making progress . ''
     Few would have foreseen such a furor when , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Marin County</ENAMEX> bicycle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> created a hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> using fat tires , lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology .
     They wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">machine</ENAMEX> that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cycles</ENAMEX> .
     They got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">machine</ENAMEX> more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> that then were the rage .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> first entered mass production in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , they were dismissed as a fad .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bicycles</ENAMEX> sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> were mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , a bellwether market , they accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 %</NUMEX> of all bike sales .
     The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> never even make it into the high country .
     City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Crested Butte</ENAMEX> , population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX> , is a bastion of the sport .
     By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> estimate , everyone here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under 50</TIMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> .

     Stock-market tremors again shook bond prices , while the dollar turned in a mixed performance .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Early yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> scrambled to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     But stocks later recovered , erasing most of their early declines .
     That cut short the rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds and depressed prices moderately below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> 's levels .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60.25</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day</TIMEX> , finished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.65</NUMEX> points lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2638.73</NUMEX> .
     Long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues declined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     `` The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Conlon </ENAMEX>, an executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nikko Securities</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world did n't end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> '' or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Gold</ENAMEX> , a closely watched barometer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> anxiety , was little changed .
     The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit surged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.77 billion</NUMEX> .
     But the dollar later rebounded , finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence .
     In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short-term interest rates , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> once again pumped money into the banking system .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> move was a small gesture , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-quarter</NUMEX> percentage point .
     The federal funds rate on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> loans between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> has been hovering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> previously .
     Although stocks have led bonds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> predict that relationship will reverse during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few weeks</TIMEX> .

     The new reserves bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's provision for loans to Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> 's medium and long-term loans to these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> were only slightly disappointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's numbers .
     `` There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carole Berger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C.J.

     Earnings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's global consumer business grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> .
     `` The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDermott</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keefe , Bruyette & Woods</ENAMEX> .
     Corporate finance and trading results in member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</ENAMEX> were `` relatively flat , sometimes choppy , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> said , and profit for the area sank <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> .

     But he reiterated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 billion</NUMEX> , covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.9 billion</NUMEX> of such loans outstanding .

     A `` concerning '' item the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> cited was the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> jump in expenses , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> and its overseas branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said , however , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> continued to generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the highest profit margins among major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , minimizing a drop in net interest margin with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages .
     Its margin fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> basis points , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/100ths</NUMEX> of a percentage point , from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , compared with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-point drop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> and much larger declines among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> 's net interest income rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 537 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     Non-interest income fell slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.9 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 193.3 million</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> continued to rigorously control non-interest expense , which was almost flat at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 393.4 million</NUMEX> .
     The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.25 %</NUMEX> return on average assets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</NUMEX> higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> 's and a profit ratio matched by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> 's return on equity increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.4 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.8 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 806.8 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 880.9 million</NUMEX> .
     But the amount was still <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 %</NUMEX> higher than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> level , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> higher as a percentage of total loans .
     That trend , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs , are about the only worries <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> 's financial picture .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve , which increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 711 million</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 664 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter</TIMEX> but was down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 852 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> still had some shaky foreign loans .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 million</NUMEX> gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> .
     The comparable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> number was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 million</NUMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</NUMEX> , covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     The net interest margin - the difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , as did certain areas of wholesale banking .
     Fees from syndicating loans dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million</NUMEX> .
     `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     Expenses unrelated to interest rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 541 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PNC Financial</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PNC Financial</ENAMEX> cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs .
     Net interest income in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> edged up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 317.7 million</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's total allowance for credit losses was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 502.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.82 %</NUMEX> of total loans .

     After a landslide win in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> in polls held after the assassination of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indira Gandhi</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride .
     His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">early</TIMEX> promises to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy .
     His pledge to clean up local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> politics , including his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> , went unfulfilled .
     His `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr. Clean</ENAMEX> '' image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal , which will be a major campaign issue .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> predict that disappointment in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi </ENAMEX>'s spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will crest at the polls .
     `` There 's a wide feeling of indignation across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bhabani Sen Gupta</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Center for Policy Research</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Delhi</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will be judging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">regime</ENAMEX> by a petty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> , by a corrupt revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> .
     This could be a big protest against an administrative failure . ''
     Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- retains control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi </ENAMEX>'s ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority .
     Economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> call his trail-blazing liberalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> economy incomplete , and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lok Sabha</ENAMEX> , or lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> , has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">542</NUMEX> elected and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> appointed seats .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- captured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</NUMEX> seats , the largest victory in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> democracy .
     The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> at the time .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> had been assassinated by separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sikhs</ENAMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> feared their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> might split apart .
     In the previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress Party</ENAMEX> won after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> 's victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Bangladesh war</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> was thrown out of office after her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">19-month</TIMEX> emergency rule , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , after her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> made a mess of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> in power , she was restored to office .
     Most political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> unites to field single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">precincts</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- will lose big .
     But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> remains fractured , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- could win a small majority , or lead a coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chimanbhai Mehta</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parliamentarian</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- will win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 150</NUMEX> seats , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">house</ENAMEX> , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> fields single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of the races .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> will struggle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> .
     The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> signed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</NUMEX> contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AB Bofors</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nobel Industries Sweden AB</ENAMEX> , to purchase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> artillery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">pieces</ENAMEX> .
     The contract was negotiated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime ministers</ENAMEX> , and was supposed to be free of commissions or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> ' costs .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1987</TIMEX> , evidence surfaced that commissions were paid .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> charged that the money was used to bribe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , an allegation denied by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     But many of his statements on the issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence .
     The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> blocked passage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> constitutional amendment bills .
     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> that such government bills were defeated .
     In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">school</ENAMEX> , the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bofors</ENAMEX> has become a potent rallying cry against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     That illustrates the kind of disappointment many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> feel toward Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his first two years</TIMEX> in power .
     His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has chalked up some successes .
     But the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> had tremendous hope in the youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> and his promise to make both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> more effective and less corrupt .
     His failures in those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> .
     `` We do n't like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sooraji Jath</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Gujarat</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bread</ENAMEX> and not giving us any support .
     When there are well problems , light problems , road problems , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> tells us to forget it . ''
     The greatest thing going for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party</ENAMEX> is the poor reputation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> .
     Even if it unites for the elections , its coherence is likely to be temporary .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- lost the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> election , following Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's hated emergency rule , a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> took power and then disintegrated .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> fear a repeat of that experience .

     The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices .
     But bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market .
     In early trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's stock market debacle would be repeated .
     But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</TIMEX> , dashed those expectations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds also were hurt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late in the day</TIMEX> by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> offering by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt .
     `` Bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Early</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated Investors Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     `` When stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . ''
     Meanwhile , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second straight day</TIMEX> , the bond market paid little attention to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> 's open market operations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> injected more cash into the banking system by arranging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> of repurchase agreements during the usual <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">pre-noon</TIMEX> intervention period .
     The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence .
     `` The intervention has been friendly , meaning that they really did n't have to do it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Fiorini Ramirez</ENAMEX> , money-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .</ENAMEX>
     She said a more aggressive move was n't needed .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further .
     It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> from its previous target level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</NUMEX> .
     The rate , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> loans , is considered an early signal of changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> policy .
     It ended at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 11\/16 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , but was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as low as 8 1\/2 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1\/2</NUMEX> point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 5</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount , while the yield moved above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     Investment-grade corporate , municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell .
     But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Some so-called high-quality junk issues , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">R.H. Macy & Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 1\/2 %</NUMEX> subordinated debentures , rose .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Macy 's</ENAMEX> issue closed up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> point at a bid price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> 's public debt offering was its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">15 years</TIMEX> .
     Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said hedging related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> pricing also pressured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Underwriters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> bonds reduced their market risk by selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> to cover at least part of their -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> -RCB- holdings , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James R.

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> will announce the size of its next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> note sale and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> will announce details of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bond offering .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> estimate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.75 billion</NUMEX> of new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> will be sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> , and they expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX> to offer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion to $ 6 billion</NUMEX> of long-term `` bailout '' bonds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX> was created to help fund the thrift bailout .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> issue came to market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Office of Finance</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Home Loan Banks</ENAMEX> said it priced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-part <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.27 billion</NUMEX> bond offering for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to yield from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.125 % to 8.375 %</NUMEX> .
     The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market , including a report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.77 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , up from a revised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.24 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> gap was expected to have expanded to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.1 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Securities
     Treasury</ENAMEX> securities were essentially flat to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/2</NUMEX> point lower .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond was quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 28\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 19\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.97 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .

     The discount rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> bills rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.52 %</NUMEX> for a bond-equivalent yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.75 %</NUMEX> .
     The rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.53 %</NUMEX> for a bond-equivalent yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.92 %</NUMEX> .
     Corporate , Other Issues
     Investment-grade corporate bonds ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4 to 1\/2</NUMEX> point lower , while most junk bonds ended unchanged .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> 's huge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> offering dominated attention in the new-issue market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.06 %</NUMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.42 %</NUMEX> ; and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> notes priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.33 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> , which operates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest electric power systems , is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> wholly owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's bond sale was part of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.7 billion</NUMEX> refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> owes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX> priced a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> note offering to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.39 %</NUMEX> .
     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new Remics totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 850 million</NUMEX> were offered and talk circulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX> more issues that could be priced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> of volatile trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> noted that it 's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Remics priced were a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> issue underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> deal underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Greenwich Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
     The Remic issuance supported prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> securities , which held up better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> securities during an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> sell-off .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 29\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/32</NUMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1\/2 %</NUMEX> securities at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 31\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6\/32</NUMEX> ; and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> securities at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 29\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/32</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 5\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/32</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue was yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.43 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> note held at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.42</NUMEX> percentage points .
     Municipals
     Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena , as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds .
     Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading .
     Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer</ENAMEX> , will accept bids <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large lists of bonds that include many such issues .
     The lists total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 654.5 million</NUMEX> .
     Pre-refunded bonds are called at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue .
     Meanwhile , several new issues were priced .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Underwriters</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> set preliminary pricing for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 144.4 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Health Facilities Financing Authority</ENAMEX> revenue bonds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaiser Permanente</ENAMEX> .
     Tentative reoffering yields were set from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.25 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.227 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2018</TIMEX> .
     As part of its College Savings Plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100.4 million</NUMEX> of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.25 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.90 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2006</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2007</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2009</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Securities</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> won a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> general obligation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> ' tax note issue due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 1 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 3\/4 %</NUMEX> notes yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.25 %</NUMEX> .
     Foreign Bonds
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride , pulled down by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock market gains then up by a wider-than-expected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit and falling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock prices .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.95</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> point from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.01 %</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 3\/4 %</NUMEX> notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1994</TIMEX> were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97.85</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.31 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3\/4 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2003\/2007</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23\/32 to 112 10\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.03 %</NUMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> bonds ended weaker .
     The benchmark No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> ended on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> ' screens at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> point to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.27 %</NUMEX> .

<DOCNO> WSJ2044 </DOCNO>
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 67 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> spending bill that provides a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
     The current ceiling on home loans insured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> would be increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 124,875</NUMEX> .
     Separately , the bill gives authority to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> provision , affecting so-called <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> mortgages , has met strong opposition from investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> represented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Public Securities Association</ENAMEX> .
     And a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">squad</ENAMEX> of influential former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> employed by the Wall Street firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Capitol</ENAMEX> in a vain attempt to strip the provision .
     By an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> margin , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> voted to preserve the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> mortgage refinancing plan , and despite powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">opposition</ENAMEX> found itself undercut by an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> currently is subsidizing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 23,000</NUMEX> loans <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 11 %</NUMEX> under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> program , and however disruptive to private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , the refinancing is expected to yield <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 15 million</NUMEX> in savings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     This sum has been guarded jealously by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appropriators</ENAMEX> anxious to offset spending elsewhere , and conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX> cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests .
     `` We are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stewards</ENAMEX> here , not of the mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> .
     The action came as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> won final congressional approval of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 million</NUMEX> in assistance for elections scheduled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> .
     The bulk of the money would be funneled through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Endowment for Democracy </ENAMEX>, but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> had refused <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> to invoke cloture and limit debate , but behind the bipartisan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> , a solid majority took shape <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> .
     Final approval -- on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> roll call -- was never in doubt , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> drew an unusual mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX> .
     The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> is likely to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Union Nacional Opositora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> 's standing , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> irony is that under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> law a major portion of the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> 's funds must be shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Electoral Council</ENAMEX> .
     Within the appropriations conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 67 billion</NUMEX> measure is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science , housing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> and the environment .
     The decision to raise the ceiling on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> home loans still faces strong opposition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 1 billion</NUMEX> in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget .
     These costs will complicate the budget picture in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> , and the measure further commits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to a set of costly projects , including the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> construction funds for the space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">station</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">station</ENAMEX> is promised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> within the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.36 billion</NUMEX> provided for research and development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's high-speed aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> -- cut by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> -- could receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 60 million</NUMEX> in new funds or transfers .
     Similarly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> agreed to add back <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62 million</NUMEX> to continue work on the advanced communications technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">satellite</ENAMEX> , being developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co .</ENAMEX>
     And while setting a statutory limit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> on the automated space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">probe</ENAMEX> , the conference appropriated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> for the start-up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CRAF</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cassini</ENAMEX> mission , a successor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Voyager</ENAMEX> space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">probe</ENAMEX> .
     Among major domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 829.9 million</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $ 1.57 billion</NUMEX> is separately allocated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Science Foundation </ENAMEX>, and within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Housing and Urban Development Department</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 9.2 billion</NUMEX> is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> that serve the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     To an unusual degree , the massive bill has become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> to earmark funds for projects in home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> , environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">projects</ENAMEX> and urban grants designated for specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">communities</ENAMEX> .
     The most striking example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> may have been in community development funds , where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> had separately approved a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> projects valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> , and the conference added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> more valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's conference agreement is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major bill to emerge from negotiations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appropriators</ENAMEX> approved a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> transportation bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights .
     An exemption will remain for flights <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than six hours</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , but estimates by the tobacco industry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> indicate all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> flights would be covered .
     Separately , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> conference report covering an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.4 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Postal Service</ENAMEX> bill was sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> after passing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">383</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> roll call <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     And after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of delay , the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape .
     Defense and foreign aid are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most critical areas remaining from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's standpoint .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Gold</ENAMEX> , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness : The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market .
     The settlement prices of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> gold contracts were even with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's final prices .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1989</TIMEX> contract , which has the greatest trading volume , ended at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 371.20</NUMEX> an ounce .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">other months</TIMEX> posted advances of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents to 20 cents</NUMEX> an ounce .
     According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , Bernard Savaiko of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , the stock market 's ability on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to rally from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices , and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> 's , in particular .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> traded within a narrow range .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Gold</ENAMEX> tried to rally on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than a year</TIMEX> : selling by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> , who want to fix the highest possible price for their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> is trading in a range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 365 to $ 375</NUMEX> -LCB- an ounce -RCB- and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> said .

     Also , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> noted , stock market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> attractive .

     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> are comfortable with the actions of the -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> -RCB- in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock market rebound on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , '' he said .
     There is n't any rush on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in the West to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> , he said .
     `` They still bear the memory of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> , when they bought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nichols</ENAMEX> said .
     `` It 's an experience they do n't want to repeat . ''
     At the moment <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> .

     There is little incentive to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> because if the stock market goes higher , it may be just a false alarm .
     This is keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> handcuffed . ''
     The most remarkable feature about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's action was that the price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 370</NUMEX> an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> around the world to aggressively sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> said .
     `` I do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> are grateful for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> or so that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> has risen over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> or so , '' he said .
     Previously , he noted , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as much as possible before selling .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> observed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> merchandise trade deficit , which rose sharply in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , according to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's report , has been having less and less impact on the gold market .
     `` The dollar has n't reacted much to it , so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> has n't either , '' he said .
     In other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> :
     ENERGY :
     Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market .
     Since stock market indexes plummeted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in all markets have been wary .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> become confident that the stock market has stabilized , oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration .
     Crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery edged up by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 cents</NUMEX> a barrel to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.75</NUMEX> a barrel .
     Heating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> prices also rose .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> slipped slightly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SUGAR</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices rose on a report that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> may seek to postpone some sugar shipments .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> contract advanced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.14 cent</NUMEX> a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.11 cents</NUMEX> .
     According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year</TIMEX> , into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is perceived as a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> has been deferring shipments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     `` To the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> in the trade it did n't cause much surprise .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> futures contract traded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 14.24 cents</NUMEX> , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">LIVESTOCK</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">MEATS</ENAMEX> :
     The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> shook off fears that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> .
     The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     Cattle futures prices were also supported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">GRAINS</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SOYBEANS</ENAMEX> :
     The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is interested in buying from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">South America</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 250,000 metric tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">as many as 400,000 metric tons</NUMEX> of soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meal</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> are especially sensitive to reports of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> soybean sales because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports are lagging .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 1</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 13 million fewer bushels</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> have been sold overseas than for the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .

     HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort , even as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> fades .

     In lobbying on other health-coverage topics , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX> will press for legislation that would give self-employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> tax deduction for their own health plans , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> currently .

     Small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves .

     But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">24,000 miles</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">garage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> say they would benefit because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> would be less likely to go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> for the simpler repairs after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> .
     The repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> are n't united , however .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Shops</ENAMEX> represented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Automotive Service Industry Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> oppose any increase in warranty length .
     They say the longer the warranty , the longer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> will automatically return to new-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , which then find non-warranty work that might otherwise go to repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Energy Committee</ENAMEX> will debate the issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this month</TIMEX> .
