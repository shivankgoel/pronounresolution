     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanislav Ovcharenko</ENAMEX> , who represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> here , has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika .
     In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> overlooking the runway of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko</ENAMEX> enthusiastically throws out what he calls `` just ideas '' :
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , he suggests , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA Group Ltd.</ENAMEX> , the international aircraft leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland</ENAMEX> , could lease some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">jetliners</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> flag <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> , could teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeings</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> could be based here at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport</ENAMEX> .
     That 's not all , he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">authority</ENAMEX> , could build a cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">terminal</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> could lease some of its cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus</ENAMEX> , through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA</ENAMEX> , for a joint-venture cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     And then there is his notion of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> to ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Armenians</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon</ENAMEX> .
     Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko</ENAMEX> 's head ?
     Hardly .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> aviation connection is alive and well here at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA</ENAMEX> is indeed talking about leasing Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> and even about buying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tupolev</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">204s</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus</ENAMEX> is in discussions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> about a cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> and other possibilities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta</ENAMEX> already has so many ventures with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> that its chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> is studying <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> .
     Unlikely as it may seem , tiny , politically neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland</ENAMEX> has penetrated the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> airline bureaucracy .
     And as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> aviation industry seems poised to benefit .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are similar , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko</ENAMEX> .
     `` They look the same .
     They 're very friendly . ''
     Moreover , he says , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are small but spunky .
     `` We have to study their experience very well , '' he says .
     `` We must find any way to get business . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups have been working together since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> , long before <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> were the rage in the West .
     Aeroflot carried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 125 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's largest transit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> flights and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> pass through .
     An apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> is the crew-rest and staging area for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> of aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Tankers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ventspils</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> unload <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">25 million gallons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> into a special tank farm at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> .
     What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> does n't pour into its own gas-guzzling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">Ilyushins</ENAMEX> is bartered to the airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">authority</ENAMEX> , which resells it to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pakistan International Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> thus pays its landing fees , ground-handling and catering bills with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> , preserving its hard currency .
     That is n't all .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">authority</ENAMEX> , in a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> , opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hard-currency duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Sheremetyevo Airport</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta</ENAMEX> now manages duty-free sales on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> international flights out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
     Duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Leningrad</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Pulkova Airport</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , and hard-currency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Leningrad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> frontier are coming soon .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta</ENAMEX> is talking about similar joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tashkent</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sochi</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Black Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">resort</ENAMEX> , and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tbilisi</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> 's international fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">285</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> is being repainted and refurbished at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon Airport</ENAMEX> .
     Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to issue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> tickets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> here are taking advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> 's reasonable prices to board flights in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon</ENAMEX> for holidays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Havana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kingston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mexico City</ENAMEX> .
     The round-trip fare to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Havana</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">410 Irish punts</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 578</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Jamaica</ENAMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">504 punts</NUMEX> .
     A formal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raisa Gorbachev</ENAMEX> stopped here for talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Haughey</ENAMEX> .
     New trade accords were signed .
     It all started with geography .
     When it opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1939</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">landfall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> for thirsty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> flying from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> .
     Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> made a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon</ENAMEX> stop unnecessary for most Western air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">fleets</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> still flies inefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">Ilyushins</ENAMEX> that ca n't make it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Managua</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hop .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland</ENAMEX> did n't spurn the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> after they shot down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Korean Air Lines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jetliner</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Sea of Japan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , though it suspended direct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon</ENAMEX> flights for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus</ENAMEX> started ferrying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Shannon</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> stripped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> landing rights .
     Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Rianta</ENAMEX> is making a heap of money from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> friendship .
     And , with those contacts in place , it could be relatively simple to add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aer Lingus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GPA</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">team</ENAMEX> .
     Then , perhaps , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovcharenko</ENAMEX> 's ideas would n't sound like so much blarney .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor Corp.</ENAMEX> begins shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> from the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thin-slab <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets .
     An ebullient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Iverson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> eventually will make <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a ton</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.5 man hours</TIMEX> , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four to six man hours</TIMEX> at a conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mill</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 've had the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> visiting us , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> beams .
     `` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely . ''
     Especially his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> , the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> .
     Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco Inc.</ENAMEX> are studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor</ENAMEX> 's technology to see if they can adopt it .
     Says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> : `` It 's damn worrisome . ''
     The once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990s</TIMEX> technology revolution .
     New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller , less cash-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">decades ago</TIMEX> .
     It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market -- the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> ' largest , most prized , and until now , untouchable , market .
     But such thin-slab technology is only the beginning .
     Eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting , which by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the 1990s</TIMEX> will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces .
     Those massive structures , while posing cost and environmental headaches , effectively locked out all but deep-pocketed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> from steelmaking .
     `` There 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dennis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , manufacturing and technology , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Iron Ore and Steel Institute</ENAMEX> .
     It is n't that major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> have blithely ignored high technology .
     In fact , they 've spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> to boost the percentage of continously cast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.6 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years before</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , their balance sheets are rich with diversity , their old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> shuttered , and work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> lean .
     But that wo n't suffice .
     `` It 's no longer enough to beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> .
     You have to beat everyone around the world , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX> .
     He wants to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> more involved in computers and artificial intelligence .
     The problem : They 're saddled with huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> that require costly maintenance .
     And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening , hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity -- the industry 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Vadar</ENAMEX> .
     `` The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Marcus</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` They 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to be flexible . ''
     No one expects <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimills</ENAMEX> to eclipse major integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> , who remain the undisputed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">kings</ENAMEX> of highest-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> and refrigerators .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Crawfordsville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> , ultimately will produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only one million tons</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , a drop in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">40-million-ton</NUMEX>-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket , and it will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> before such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> can compete in the high-profit market .
     Still , flat-rolled is the steel industry 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bread</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">butter</ENAMEX> , representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">the 80 million tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> expected to be shipped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches .
     Because all operations are connected , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> equipment failure forces a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> shutdown .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some days</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> does n't produce anything .
     `` At this point , the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market , but it does challenge them to develop new markets , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James McCall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , materials , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Battelle</ENAMEX> , a technology and management-research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , with demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> not growing fast enough to absorb capacity , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> will have to change the way they do business .
     In the past , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Corey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> made a product and set it out on the loading dock .
     `` We said : ` We 've got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , ' '' he says , adding : `` Now we 're figuring out what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need , and are going back to make it . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco</ENAMEX> 's sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CITY">Fairfax</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kansas City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two or three days</TIMEX> a week .
     When they determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> needed parts more quickly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco</ENAMEX> convinced a steel service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> to build a processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> nearby so shipments could be delivered within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> .
     Cementing such relationships with major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and appliance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> -- is a means of survival , especially when those key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> are relying on a smaller pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> and flirting with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aluminum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     For example , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> began talking about plastic-bodied <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Iron and Steel Institute</ENAMEX> began a major lobbying effort to show <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> how they could use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> must also find new markets .
     After letting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aluminum</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> take the recycling lead , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> started a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Battelle</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCall</ENAMEX> thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> should concentrate more on construction .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weirton Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Weirton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">W. Va.</ENAMEX> , for example , is touting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> fashionable steel doors , with leaded glass inserts , as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> envision steel roofs covering suburbia .
     Still others are looking at overseas markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> reactivated its overseas sales operation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Producers</ENAMEX> also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimills</ENAMEX> .
     Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> involve building electrogalvanizing lines , used to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> for such products as household appliances and car doors .
     But unfortunately , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">segment</ENAMEX> is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's like everyone climbing out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">QE II</ENAMEX> and getting into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">lifeboat</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jacobson</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AUS Consultants</ENAMEX> .
     `` After a while , someone has to go over the side . ''
     Although he does n't expect any bankruptcies , he does see more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> being sold or closed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall</ENAMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Brookings Institute</ENAMEX> , agrees .
     `` Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">minimills</ENAMEX> . ''
     Not to mention the incursion of imports .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> , which have led the recent technology developments , are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can expect more competition from low-cost producing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Pacific Rim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> recently announced plans to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nucor</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid Corp.</ENAMEX> 's patent-infringement damages case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> , one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever , is getting scant attention on Wall Street .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">78 days</TIMEX> of mind-numbing testimony in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , the trial is being all but ignored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> .
     Most have read the pre-trial documents , however , and estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> will be ordered to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> for infringing on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> patents .
     That may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> seeks .
     The highest patent damage award to date was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith International Inc.</ENAMEX> was ordered to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 205 million</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baker Hughes Inc.</ENAMEX> for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> later agreed to settle for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 million</NUMEX> .
     Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think it is worth their time to slog through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> trial testimony .
     `` It 's like panning for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Grand Central Station</ENAMEX> .
     You might find something , but the chances are low , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ellman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Glazer</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> , said : `` If you hired an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> to be there all the time and give you a -LRB- prediction -RRB- of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">75-day</TIMEX> trial in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , infringed on patents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass .</ENAMEX>
     The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was `` willful and deliberate . ''
     If so , the damages could be tripled .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> who have read the transcripts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Nelson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvert D. Crary</ENAMEX> , a litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Labe , Simpson &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. David Mazzone</ENAMEX> will decide in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's favor on the `` willful and deliberate '' issue .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crary</ENAMEX> said testimony by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis T. Carr</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kenyon &amp; Kenyon</ENAMEX> , showed that `` he worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> continuously from the outset of the project '' in an effort to avoid infringement .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> on many occasions to avoid various features because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> 's patent positions , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> followed his advice in every instance , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crary</ENAMEX> said .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Kayton</ENAMEX> , a patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">George Mason University School of Law</ENAMEX> who is familiar with the case , said the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> patents were infringed `` suggests that infringement was willful .
     It 's difficult to be that consistently wrong . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> also wonder whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mazzone</ENAMEX> will use the lost-profits method of determining damages , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> favors because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> had n't entered the market .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it would n't have been forced to match <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's lower prices .
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">side</ENAMEX> has called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Business School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> to testify on that issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Buzzell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> brought in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Dolan</ENAMEX> .
     `` There 's nothing that says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Business school</ENAMEX> have to agree with each other , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buzzell</ENAMEX> .
     Testimony is expected to continue until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early December</TIMEX> .
     A decision is n't expected until some time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> said earnings tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , even a bit further than expected , rendering the outlook doubtful for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few quarters</TIMEX> .
     The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives , a business that accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some 10 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> revenue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which telegraphed the poor results <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three weeks ago</TIMEX> , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> .
     Earnings fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 877 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.51</NUMEX> a share , somewhat below securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' revised expectations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1.60</NUMEX> a share .
     That compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.10</NUMEX> a share -- which was inflated by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15-cents</NUMEX>-a-share gain from the sale of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> relating to a software dispute .
     Revenue climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.31 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.71 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , remained upbeat .
     The computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> results have been dismal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , noted that revenue rose again in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , following an increase in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> period .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said in a statement that `` demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> products and services continues to be good world-wide .
     We do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth . ''
     Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , however , remained downbeat .
     `` I think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">another mediocre year</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Milunovich</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Stevens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.50</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> and to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.50</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.35</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected .
     Both estimates would mark declines from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.81 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.80</NUMEX> a share , which itself was well below the record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said he kept a `` buy\/hold '' recommendation on the stock only because `` all the damage has been done . ''
     He said the stock has n't traded below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/2</NUMEX> times book value over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 10 years</TIMEX> , which at the moment computes to a stock price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> .
     The stock closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 103</NUMEX> a share , up just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> as the market surged .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` A key part of the question is , how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up ? '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Cohen</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SoundView Financial Group</ENAMEX> .
     `` And the input I 've had from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> is that it still could be a while . ''
     On leasing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Djurdjevic</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Annex Research</ENAMEX> said he thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has hurt itself unnecessarily .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has priced its leases aggressively , thinking that would help win business .
     But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> would have won the business anyway as a sale to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> that would have then leased the equipment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Bardagy</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Comdisco Inc.</ENAMEX> , a huge leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , said : `` To put it mildly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM Credit</ENAMEX> has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> we have ever seen . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes .
     But the basic technology in the line is almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">five years old</TIMEX> , which means it is long in the tooth , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> are rolling out strong products of their own .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market , and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     But it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">these days</TIMEX> , and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely on for much growth .
     The disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">AS\/400</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's highly successful minicomputer line , is losing its momentum , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said sales could even decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's growth in software in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 8.8 %</NUMEX> , well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's payment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> and the stronger dollar .
     And expenses , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , have stayed stubbornly high .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.17 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.43</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.46 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.83</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42.25 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39.68 billion</NUMEX> .

     So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have said they are looking for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.30 to $ 3.35</NUMEX> a share .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , the soft-drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.90</NUMEX> a share .
     Results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> will include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 40 cents</NUMEX> a share from the dilutive effects of snack-food and bottling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> acquisitions .
     In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.125</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.125</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> sales are expected to increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.12 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year 's third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Domestic soft-drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> -- well below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % to 5 %</NUMEX> growth of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years</TIMEX> -- but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX> blamed the slower volume on rainier weather , a dearth of new products in the industry and -- to a much lesser extent -- pricing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo</ENAMEX> said its soft-drink prices were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</NUMEX> higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX> also noted that soft-drink volume rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a hefty 9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year 's third quarter</TIMEX> , making the comparison more difficult .
     International soft-drink volume was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6 %</NUMEX> .
     Snack-food tonnage increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a strong 7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , while domestic profit increased in double digits , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX> said .
     Excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> snack-food business acquired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , snack-food international tonnage jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> , with sales strong in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> .
     Total snack-food profit rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> .
     Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pizza Hut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> , restaurant earnings increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> sales increase .
     Same-store sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pizza Hut</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13 %</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> 's increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> continues to benefit from its price-value strategy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tacos</ENAMEX> .
     Same store-sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> , which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> , which has been slow to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> ' shifting tastes away from fried foods , has been developing a grilled-chicken product that may be introduced nationally at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next year</TIMEX> .
     The new product has performed well in a market test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev.</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX> said .
     After a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.7 billion</NUMEX> acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bottlers</ENAMEX> , a fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> and an overseas snack-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX> said he does n't expect any major acquisition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year or so</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">CHICAGO</ENAMEX> - Options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> were among the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">victims</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunging stock market , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that required an emergency <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> bailout .
     While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's rebounding markets helped other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> recoup losses , many options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> losses , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> here and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> said .
     Options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> were hurt worse than others on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based .
     Thus , options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Miller</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is `` very easy for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to get wiped out .
     That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures . ''
     An options contract gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> the right to buy -LRB- call -RRB- or sell -LRB- put -RRB- a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based on a predetermined price within a given time period .
     Options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling .
     They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss .
     The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fled the market because of huge losses .
     Making matters worse was the fact that late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE</ENAMEX> halted stock-index options trading in step with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> 's halt in stock-index futures .
     But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merc</ENAMEX> reopened <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour later</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE</ENAMEX> remained closed , leaving many options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger `` Duke '' Chapman</ENAMEX> , said that , unlike the futures market , the options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade .
     Exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and final time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE</ENAMEX> reasoned that its best course was to remain closed .
     The damage was so bad at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett Corp.</ENAMEX> , an options trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options of Chicago</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> , as a result of options trading losses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fosset</ENAMEX> so far is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">member</ENAMEX> of a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> to be forced to be taken over by another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's rout .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett</ENAMEX> still had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several million dollars</NUMEX> in capital left after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's close of trading , but not enough that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> , worried about another potential market plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing Corp.</ENAMEX> , as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Fossett</ENAMEX> , put up a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> in case the market plunged again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.

     `` A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> . ''
     The bailout was cobbled together over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Comptroller of the Currency</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> as well as the options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     `` It was great to have the luxury of time , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rawls</ENAMEX> said .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , an options industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> had to talk the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</ENAMEX> 's night <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchman</ENAMEX> into giving him the home phone number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silas Keene</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chicago Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options</ENAMEX> did n't have to put any money into the bailout .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">CBOE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to conclude that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> had some losses and liquidity problems during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash as well , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rawls</ENAMEX> said .
     A federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> worked with securities and banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> to fashion the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett</ENAMEX> bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> .

     In some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> sneak massage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , fearful that upper-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> wo n't approve .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX> 's indulgence is nothing like the oily , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>-long rubfests enjoyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> .
     Nor does it at all resemble -LRB- despite what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> think -RRB- the more intimate variety offered at specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parlors</ENAMEX> in bad parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> .
     On the contrary , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> , where stressed-out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> relax in specially designed chairs , fully clothed .
     The massages <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last 15 minutes</TIMEX> and typically cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heinz</ENAMEX> , even pay part of the fee .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vidunas</ENAMEX> has been seeing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> a visit since the program was started at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heinz</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .

     Massage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> say that kneading the head , shoulders , neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale .
     They also insist that touching is a basic need , as powerful as the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> or sleep , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> is as good a place as any to do it .
     `` The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minnie Morey</ENAMEX> , an operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , where massages began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     `` When you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> after your massage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say you look like you 're glowing . ''

''
     Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , opened its doors to on-site massage .
     And even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> paid the bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> grumbled .
     `` Sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear ` oohs ' and ` ahs ' coming out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , '' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Banks</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> 's health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> .
     `` And you ca n't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> coming into an audit hearing ` oohs ' and ` ahs . ' ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , the complaints intensified and the massages ended .
     `` Now we 're looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> with thicker walls , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> says .
     Massage also has an image problem to contend with .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs</ENAMEX> have tried to get around this by calling themselves `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodyworkers</ENAMEX> '' and describing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> visits as `` reinvigoration breaks . ''
     But massage , no matter how chaste , is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution , and that makes some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> nervous .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the research and development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weyerhaeuser Co.</ENAMEX> , the large wood-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , invited a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuse</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tacoma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Harms</ENAMEX> , a software <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> , was an eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> .
     `` You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all day</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     But after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about eight months</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Soule</ENAMEX> , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soule</ENAMEX> says his only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> was that the massages were being given in a company conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> 's supervised health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> would have been fine .
     `` In my view , -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with an appropriate mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> around , '' he says .
     Given such attitudes , some corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs</ENAMEX> prefer to go about their business quietly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Borner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Park Ridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , says he has been working for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> at a huge chemical and manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> -- unbeknownst to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     He visits the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">two or three weeks</TIMEX> .
     His massage chair is kept in a closet , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> escorts him past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is common with a lot of large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borner</ENAMEX> , who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">23 years</TIMEX> before choosing his current trade .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> , he contends , `` are afraid how they 're going to look in the eyes of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> .
     My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch .
     My attitude is : Let 's come out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">closet</ENAMEX> . ''
     Occasionally , all that 's needed is a little coaxing .

     She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits . `` I pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byler</ENAMEX> , who has been visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Emerson</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .

     To help do this , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer</ENAMEX> developed a portable massage chair <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> that he hopes will bring `` structured touching '' into mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> .
     `` The culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45</NUMEX> , '' he says .
     `` The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seated .

     Sitting in one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer</ENAMEX> 's chairs , which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 425</NUMEX> and have since been copied by others , is a bit like straddling a recliner .

     In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> , an international bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate</ENAMEX> has terminated a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million</NUMEX> credit for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shanghai</ENAMEX> property project .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders Asia Ltd.</ENAMEX> , agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last November</TIMEX> to provide the loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> property <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks ago</TIMEX> , in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> killings , the loan was canceled , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> close to the project .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the move .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Lenders</ENAMEX> had doubts about the project even before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> , but the harsh crackdown , which caused many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to reassess their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> transactions , `` gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> the out they wanted , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shanghai</ENAMEX> venture .
     The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> have taken toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> .
     While some commercial lending has resumed , international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> remain nervous about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's economic troubles and foreign debt -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1988</TIMEX> .
     Many loans are being renegotiated , especially those tied to the hotel sector , which has been hit hard by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">post-June 4</TIMEX> tourism slump .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> view property-sector loans as particularly risky .
     The canceled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shanghai</ENAMEX> loan leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , saddled with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-story apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> and heavy debts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> owes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shui On Group</ENAMEX> , the project 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> , and a significant , though unspecified , amount in legal fees to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coudert Brothers</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> say .
     The project , known as Lotus Mansion , has been mired in controversy .
     When the loan agreement was announced , it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     Unlike most loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">guarantor</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> secured a promise from state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Communications</ENAMEX> that it would lend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the entire $ 55 million</NUMEX> at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing .
     The loan was to have matured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just two to three years</TIMEX> , as soon as construction was completed .
     But in a letter sent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Development</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders</ENAMEX> said the loan was terminated because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> on time , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> close to the project .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Creditors</ENAMEX> involved in the project contend , however , that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations .
     Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> say , the loan fell victim to nervousness about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's political turmoil , as well as to concern about the loan 's security .
     The bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate</ENAMEX> is made up mostly of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , but it includes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citic Industrial Bank</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down .

     `` Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Hood</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> in the industry . ''
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGlade</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> raised a more fundamental question about the deal .
     `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? ''
     She said , `` I would say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> 's number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> job is to address its market-share loss -LCB- in discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> -RCB- , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins .
     At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonini</ENAMEX> is intent on pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> into new retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> is opening big food and general merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hypermarkets</ENAMEX> , and warehouse-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> specializing in office products and sporting goods .
     It also operates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waldenbooks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pay Less Drug Stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Builders Square</ENAMEX> home improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> .
     In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings .
     Under terms of the agreement , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> will soon make a tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pace</ENAMEX> shares .

     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A minute</TIMEX> later it soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX> points , then zoomed back down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> points , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's close .
     `` It was crazy , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman</ENAMEX> , general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Capital Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` It was like flying without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> in the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> . ''
     But those who said `` This ca n't be happening '' were right .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotrons</ENAMEX> were wrong .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , blamed the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> foul-up on `` a timing problem in our software '' caused by the enormous early volume -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 145 million</NUMEX> shares in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading .
     The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> said , but the average was wrong .
     Meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:40 a.m.</TIMEX> on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> and asked , `` What 's going on ?
     Is the market up or down ? ''
     At the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> was reporting that the industrial average was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> points .
     In fact , it was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holly Stark</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> who heads the trading desk at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , said that once she figured out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> numbers were wrong , she called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> to tell them .
     `` It 's been kind of annoying , to say the least , '' she said .
     To confuse matters further , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> stock finally opened on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:08 a.m.</TIMEX> , the price was listed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 324.75</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 45</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> ; in fact , its true price was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 224.75</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55</NUMEX> .
     That was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 's blooper .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> cited a `` technical error '' and declined to elaborate .
     And there were other blunders .
     When the market opened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 a.m. EST</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> newswire miscalculated the industrial average 's drop as a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> decline when it really was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> .
     `` It was a case of human error , which we found almost immediately and corrected , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> said .
     Meanwhile , some currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices .
     But it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> problems that had lingering effects .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read</ENAMEX> 's Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stark</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early afternoon</TIMEX> that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification , and she said portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen .
     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">less than a week</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> has had problems calculating the industrial average .
     At the start of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Wednesday</TIMEX> , the average appeared to plunge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> points .
     Actually , it was down only a few points at the time .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> said that snafu , which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes</TIMEX> , resulted from a failure to adjust for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stock split at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris Cos .</ENAMEX>
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said recent software changes may have contributed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's problems .
     She said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">all days</TIMEX> , '' she lamented .
     `` The eyes of the world were watching us .

     Literally .
     It turns out Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machelle Parks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> , did n't like the way defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Alexander</ENAMEX> acted during the legal proceedings .
     So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> in return for the right to punch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> .

     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> scuttled the deal at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</TIMEX> , angering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX> 's side .
     `` I never agreed to it , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> says , adding that `` it 's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements . ''
     When Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> heard about what had happened , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX> says , they volunteered that they would like to give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> a good walloping .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX> says he passed that along to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversary</ENAMEX> , and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Derr</ENAMEX> could keep its money and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> could take a shot at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> .
     Although time and place have yet to be determined , some details are in place .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX> says he agreed to strike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> above the belt .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> indicated they want to `` catch him unawares from behind , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> , for his part , insisted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">punchers</ENAMEX> ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else , ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> says he regards the agreement , which has n't been submitted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , as something of a joke .
     However , he acknowledges they `` have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to . ''

     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday .
     As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> 's huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stock-index futures pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> .
     The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> as prices soared , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guys</ENAMEX> were minting money in there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Legittino</ENAMEX> , a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elders Futures Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     The S&amp;P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to three</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early yesterday</TIMEX> after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> .
     Each index point represents a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> profit for each S&amp;P 500 contract held .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said that they were able to trade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> S&amp;P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Since the crash , many futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S&amp;P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> jammed the S&amp;P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> were shouting bids and offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a full five minutes</TIMEX> before the start of trading at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30 am</TIMEX>
     The contract fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> points at the open to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323.85</NUMEX> , the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> to stem a market slide .
     But several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher .
     The market hovered near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's closing price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328.85</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a half hour</TIMEX> , moving several index points higher or lower in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> , then broke higher and did n't look back .
     The S&amp;P 500 contract that expires in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> closed up a record <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.65</NUMEX> points on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 80,000</NUMEX> contracts .
     `` Traders <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">five feet</NUMEX> from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> S&amp;P 500 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> .
     `` You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , '' he marveled .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> was among the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> of stock-index futures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     Brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> as a rule do n't comment on their market activity .
     Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> in the S&amp;P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> profits .
     `` With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> indictments lodged against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> .

     The market for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge .
     But the junk recovery , led by the bellwether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings</ENAMEX> bonds , was precarious .
     No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> fled and brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues .
     `` Nothing traded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were n't really sure where the market should have opened '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Minella</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-head</ENAMEX> of merchant banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>

     `` Now , I feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria . ''
     But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , he said , `` You could n't buy -LCB- junk bonds -RCB- and you could n't give them away . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's rally was led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 3\/4 %</NUMEX> bonds , which initially tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96 1\/4</NUMEX> before rebounding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 3\/4</NUMEX> .
     Bonds issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kroger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duracell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Safeway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Standard</ENAMEX> also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     `` Liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> .
     `` The deadbeats are still deadbeats , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Asquith</ENAMEX> , associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Sloan School of Management</ENAMEX> , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early years</TIMEX> after issuance and rise later , says , `` We 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the big issue years of 1984 to 1986</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Bachmann</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , confirms that there is `` increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market . ''
     `` Junk bonds are a highly stratified market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Glucksman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> say junk bond offerings by `` tightly stretched '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> seem to be growing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Almost $ 8 billion</NUMEX> of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillette Holdings</ENAMEX> -LRB- not related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillette Co.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seaman Furniture</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allied Stores</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Gypsum</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">M.D.C.

     `` You could still have some very bad times ahead , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bachmann</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's possible to have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> default rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> , because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy .
     I 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom . ''
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's rally among `` good '' junk was a badly needed tonic for the market .
     Many issues `` bounced off the floor , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella</ENAMEX> said , and benchmark junk issues `` recovered all of their losses '' from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early yesterday</TIMEX> .
     In contrast , he says , `` The stock market gained back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</NUMEX> what it lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , and the -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> -RCB- bond market lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> what it gained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's rally was fueled by insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past month</TIMEX> .
     In addition , mutual funds did n't appear to be major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> of high-yield securities as was expected .
     `` Sometimes a shakeout is healthy , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinman</ENAMEX> .

     Should you really own stocks ?
     That 's a question a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are asking , following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility .
     Whipsawed financially and emotionally by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's heartstopping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>-point rebound , they 're wondering if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> has any business being in the market .
     The answer , say academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> .
     But , they say , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should n't try to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock .
     The case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling .
     `` If you look at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">75 years</TIMEX> worth of investment history -- including the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression</ENAMEX> and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Berlin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Wachovia Capital Management</ENAMEX> .
     A dollar invested in the stock market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1926</TIMEX> would have grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 473.29</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of last June</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Siegel</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ibbotson Associates Inc .</ENAMEX>
     But a dollar invested in long-term bonds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1926</TIMEX> would have grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 16.56</NUMEX> , and a dollar put in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills would equal <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a meager $ 9.29</NUMEX> .
     The longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market .
     Over time , the odds increasingly favor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> with a diversified portfolio .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Gregory</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index , the chance of losing money is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 % to 4 %</NUMEX> over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> period , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> .
     `` If you do n't need the money for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> , there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> says .
     Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> owns , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blankenship Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute of Certified Financial Planners</ENAMEX> .
     Stocks have a place in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says .
     There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> should have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least three to six months</TIMEX> of living expenses set aside in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , most investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> also should focus on building equity in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses .
     `` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blankenship</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Del Mar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> .
     But once the basics are covered , `` then I would start to invest , even if it 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 1,000</NUMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lipper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical Services Inc .</ENAMEX>
     He says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> should consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such as high-quality bonds .
     Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> should n't try to profit from short-term developments .
     `` It 's very difficult to do , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Holt</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wedbush Morgan Securities</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> can compete with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> . ''
     Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market .
     The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> of the order 's value is an average , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> 's Growth and Income mutual fund .
     And assuming their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> investment is successful , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will have to pay taxes on their gains .
     That can reduce returns by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> or more , once local taxes are included , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> says .
     After that , individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing .
     `` It 's very tough for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to out-trade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mutual funds</ENAMEX> or the market , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> .
     `` You should really think twice if you think you can out-smart the system . ''
     Then , too , many individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> lack the sturdy emotional makeup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> say is needed to plunge in and out of the market .
     So what 's the best way to buy stocks ?
     `` Unless an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> has a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000</NUMEX> to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> .
     Still , he adds , `` I could see owning both , given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> often have an advantage over big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in spotting special situations based on their own insights , '' he adds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Douglas</ENAMEX> , first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have a particular edge now in `` small to medium-size niche <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with exciting earnings prospects '' -- a traditional stomping ground for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     This growth sector , which usually carries a price\/earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 , happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now .
     `` It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term .
     Many big Wall Street brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> are now resuming coverage of this area , he notes .
     `` We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , '' he says .
     The pros strenuously advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to stay away from the latest investment fad .
     They say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull market to bail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> out of their mistakes .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's correction presents `` a pretty good buying opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmine Grigoli</ENAMEX> , chief equity portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` Buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals , '' he says .
     In the long run , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks .
     In this method , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> invests a regular amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every month</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> into the stock market whether the market is up or down .
     That cuts the risk , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , points out .
     `` When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you 're buying fewer shares , '' he says .
     Otherwise , if you put all your money in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> to get even , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> says .
     A disciplined program will work the best , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesel</ENAMEX> says .
     `` One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , '' he says .
     `` But that 's just the time when you should be buying them . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> , who faced rising doubt about his bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> even before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> buy-out came apart <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , withdrew his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.54 billion</NUMEX> offer .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> trying to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> met with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> about reviving that purchase at a lower price , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">possibly around $ 250</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.65 billion</NUMEX> .
     But a lower bid could face rejection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> , who vowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> to `` go forward '' with the bid , said he was dropping it `` in light of the recent change in market conditions . ''
     He said he might now sell his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> acted after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> failed to obtain financing for their earlier <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share bid , which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     News about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , whose shares never reopened after trading was halted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> announcement , sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56.875</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 222.875</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3 million</NUMEX> shares , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> declined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.125</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76.50</NUMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7 million</NUMEX> shares changed hands .
     Together , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , and caused a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3 %</NUMEX> drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , second in size only to the stock-market crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> .
     Some said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market debacle had given Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal .

     Some takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> had been betting against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> because he has a record of disclosing stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that are potential takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">targets</ENAMEX> , then selling at a profit without making a bid .

     `` I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past Friday</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> declined to comment , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> did n't respond to requests for interviews .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> never said how much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stock he had bought , only that his holdings were `` substantial . ''
     However , he only received federal clearance to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 million</NUMEX> of the stock on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 20</TIMEX> , when the price rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 78.50</NUMEX> .
     Between then and his bid on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 5</TIMEX> , the price fluctuated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375</NUMEX> .
     In an attempt to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> promised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to notify the market before selling any shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> was trading at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 84</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 76</NUMEX> .
     Assuming that he paid a rough average price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80</NUMEX> a share , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76.50</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall</ENAMEX> might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> or company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     However , other knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> said they believed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said they believed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> , whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out , might come back with a lower bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Neidl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillon Read &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> `` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle .
     I 'm sure he still wants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> . ''
     But others remained skeptical .
     `` I was never sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> really wanted to take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mattis</ENAMEX> , a bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` What happened with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> was a gracious way for him to bow out . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> never obtained financing for his bid .
     That skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> in a proxy fight .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> , the two lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out , met with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> familiar with the talks said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> had discussed lowering the offer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> a share , but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> a share , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> would have to borrow <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6.1 billion</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     The first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal unraveled after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase</ENAMEX> could n't raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase</ENAMEX> had agreed to commit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> , and said they were `` highly confident '' of raising another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     Together , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> in fees to raise the rest of the financing .
     But other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> was willing to pay them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> familiar with the bank talks said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> -- is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest , but is n't likely to boost its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 965 million</NUMEX> equity contribution .
     Nor is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> likely to come forward with a revised offer within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 48 hours</TIMEX> despite the hopes of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time around .
     Even if the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is able to obtain financing , the transaction still faces obstacles .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n't any competing bids .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> , whose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275</NUMEX>-a-share offer was rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , has n't shown signs of pursuing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share back-up bid he made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">coalition</ENAMEX> of labor and management , longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> 's bid , could break apart now .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's resilience gets its first test <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> convene outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> in a previously scheduled meeting .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.C . -LRB- Rick -RRB- Dubinsky</ENAMEX> faces the tough task of explaining why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> refused to finance a buy-out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> approved overwhelmingly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     The pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides .
     But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives , it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> .
     If they were to insist on a low bid of , say <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200</NUMEX> a share , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> might hesitate to finance a transaction the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> oppose .
     Also , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> .
     That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> .
