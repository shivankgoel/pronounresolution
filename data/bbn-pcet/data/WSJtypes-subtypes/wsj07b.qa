     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Ramirez</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are late .
     They pile out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tank</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> , a freshly drilled oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two miles</NUMEX> deep .
     If they finish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> can pump <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roustabout</ENAMEX> , hanging by his hands from a ladder , bounces his weight on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">three-foot</NUMEX> wrench to loosen a stuck fitting .
     `` We 've been putting in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long hours</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramirez</ENAMEX> says -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-day weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last two months</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes , `` you 'd spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> working and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> in the yard , '' he recalls .
     After a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> nightmare of uncertain oil prices , draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs , fear is finally leaving the oil patch .
     Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drillers</ENAMEX> are gingerly sinking bits into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> 's crust again .
     Some in Big Oil are easing the grip on their wallets .
     Investment capital is creeping back , and oil properties are fetching more .
     Oil-tool prices are even edging up .
     What happened ?
     In broadest terms , stability has quietly settled into international oil markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mideast</ENAMEX> politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> seems under control for now .
     `` The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Burk</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of wild swings , oil prices over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last 12 months</TIMEX> have settled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 15 to $ 20</NUMEX> a barrel .
     That is n't <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $ 40</NUMEX> that delighted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $ 10</NUMEX> that pleased users <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     But it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies , low enough to promote consumption and , most important , steady enough for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to believe in .
     Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again .
     The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">producer</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</NUMEX> of the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> .
     A recession or new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> blowup could put oil markets right back in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soup</ENAMEX> .
     Also , the new stirrings are faint , and some question their extent .
     Drilling activity is still far below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX> , there 's no hiring surge and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> continue to shrink .
     With all this , even the most wary oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> agree something has changed .
     `` It does n't appear to be getting worse .
     That in itself has got to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to feel a little more optimistic , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Cox</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co</ENAMEX> .
     Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too .
     The same roller-coaster prices that halted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil exploration and drove many veteran oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> out of the business also played havoc with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> ' corporate and personal budgets .
     Now , at least some predictability has returned , for everyone from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> .
     Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> can plan again .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> does n't want surprises , '' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Zaves</ENAMEX> , who , as fuel-services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , buys <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">some 2.4 billion gallons</NUMEX> of jet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> a year .
     Prices had been so unstable that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zaves</ENAMEX> gave up on long-term forecasts .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> `` should be comfortable , '' adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Henson Moore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of energy .
     `` I do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price . ''
     The catalyst for all this has been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">About a year ago</TIMEX> , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">roller coaster</ENAMEX> and pitched oil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Caracas</ENAMEX> into recession .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">kingpin</ENAMEX> , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">About the same time</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iraq</ENAMEX> war , which was roiling oil markets , ended .
     In addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing .
     It is projected to keep growing by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">a million barrels</NUMEX> a day , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 2 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> to come .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> , that 's ideal .
     The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to plan confidently , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi Arabian</ENAMEX> Oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hisham Nazer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary-General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subroto</ENAMEX> explains : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> offer security of markets , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> provides security of supply .
     `` This is an opportune time to find mutual ways -LCB- to prevent -RCB- price shocks from happening again , '' he says .
     To promote this balance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem .
     At its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> that can produce far more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> than their allotments .
     Being held well below capacity greatly irritates them , and has led to widespread cheating .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> has repeatedly raised its self-imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output .
     Oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> now hope to solve the issue for good through an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> proposal that gives a larger share of output to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway .
     But `` if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem , production could increase to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">24 million barrels</NUMEX> a day , making for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a very troublesome first quarter</TIMEX> , '' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nordine Ait-Laoussine</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegate</ENAMEX> .
     That would send prices plummeting from what some gun-shy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> still regard as too low a level .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick J . Early</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco Corp.</ENAMEX> 's oil-production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending .
     The view of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Big Oil</ENAMEX> , he maintains , `` is very much -LCB- similar to -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> 's outlook . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just this week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations .
     Out here on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Querecho Plains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> , however , the mood is more upbeat ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> rumble along the dusty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> and burly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in hard hats sweat and swear through the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> sun .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Energy Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co.</ENAMEX> , bought from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> the rights that allowed it to drill the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">A mile and a half</NUMEX> away looms the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">150-foot-tall</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rig</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sniper</ENAMEX> , due to be pumping by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     `` Talk is that everybody is going to drill more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Folsom</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> aims to drill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> in this area in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> and double that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with a new attitude , as it found when it went looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> .
     `` We went to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> pitching the prospect , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Parker</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> were interested . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp.</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> , ponying up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 600,000</NUMEX> in drilling and start-up costs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX> will get a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> .
     `` A kind of no-mistakes mentality '' had been stifling activity , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Covey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's oil exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> .
     Now `` everybody is a lot more optimistic . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> attraction for oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' hunger for work .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kadane Oil Co.</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">independent</ENAMEX> , is currently drilling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> itself and putting money into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> , in southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , is a `` rank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wildcat</ENAMEX> , '' a risky <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> previously has n't been found .
     `` At this price , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18</NUMEX> plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> , the economics are pretty good , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Kadane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     `` If you know you 've got stability in price , you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> . ''
     The activity is enough to move some oil-service prices back up a little .
     Some drill-bit prices have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past month</TIMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boat</ENAMEX> to deliver supplies to offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rigs</ENAMEX> now costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 3,000</NUMEX> a day , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 60 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     Some service <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boats</ENAMEX> recently were auctioned for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.7 million</NUMEX> each , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     At the bottom of the slump , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schlumberger Inc.</ENAMEX> was discounting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> on an electronic evaluation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> ; now it discounts <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drillers</ENAMEX> say .
     Still , there is money to be made .
     Most oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , when they set exploration and production budgets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , forecast revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> for each barrel of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> produced .
     Prices have averaged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2</NUMEX> a barrel higher than that -- not a windfall , but at least a pleasant bonus for them .
     So , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.</ENAMEX> survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> .
     It says <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of those surveyed report that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> exploration spending will exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> 's .
     Funds for drilling may inch up more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> if oil prices stay stable .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> , thinking in terms of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18-to-$19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> says .
     Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , scarce since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'86</TIMEX> , are edging back .
     Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Thomas</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Commerce Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''
     Wall Street generally likes the industry again .
     The appetite for oil-service stocks has been especially strong , although some got hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> cut its short-term investment ratings on them .
     Contractors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Parker Drilling Co.</ENAMEX> are raising cash again through stock offerings , and for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> oil-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> recently went public .
     -LRB- They are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grace Energy Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marine Drilling Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     Most oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are still reluctant to add to the office and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> they slashed so deeply .
     But a few new spots are opening .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur Andersen</ENAMEX> , the accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , has increased its energy staff <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     Out in the oil fields , if activity picks up much more , shortages could appear because so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roughnecks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roustabouts</ENAMEX> and others left after the crash .
     Already `` it 's hard to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     They 're so busy , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> drilling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreman</ENAMEX> here .
     For most field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , it 's about time .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramirez</ENAMEX> , who arrived late at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sharpshooter</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> because he had started <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tanks</ENAMEX> at another site , just got the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> raise he can remember in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.50</NUMEX> an hour from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Young</ENAMEX> , a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mud-logger</ENAMEX> '' at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Sniper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> , has worked all but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about nine days of this year</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , `` I was off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a straight month</TIMEX> , then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two to three weeks</TIMEX> and another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two to three weeks</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butch McCarty</ENAMEX> , who sells oil-field equipment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Davis Tool Co.</ENAMEX> , is also busy .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> of the area , he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top , then surviving the bust running an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> year I came back there was n't any work , '' he says .
     `` I think it 's on the way back now .
     But it wo n't be a boom again .
     No major booms , no major setbacks , '' he predicts .
     Business has been good enough that he just took a spur-of-the-moment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekend</TIMEX> trip to the mountain area of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Cloudcroft</ENAMEX> , something `` I have n't done in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> . ''
     The figures confirm that there certainly is n't any drilling boom .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 14,505</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,900</NUMEX> dry holes , were drilled for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> and natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of the year</TIMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.4 %</NUMEX> from the like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> period .
     But that was off less than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear</TIMEX> , when completions lagged by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.1 %</NUMEX> .
     And the number of rigs active in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is inching up .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baker Hughes Inc.</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">992</NUMEX> rotary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rigs</ENAMEX> were at work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , up from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">933</NUMEX> .
     -LRB- In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , before the bust , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rig</ENAMEX> count was above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     Global <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">offshore-rig</ENAMEX> use shows a similar upward trend .

     Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Dorfman</ENAMEX> 's recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Money Matters</ENAMEX> article -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts</ENAMEX> '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 3</TIMEX> -RRB- , I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and proclaim that the findings of your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yearlong</TIMEX> experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> .
     In particular , I do not find the fact that your group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> selections of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorfman</ENAMEX> states that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stocks selected by your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and then sold those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one month later</TIMEX> , purchasing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> new pro picks , and repeated this process for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> would have accumulated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 166,537</NUMEX> , excluding account dividends , taxes and commissions .
     In contrast , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> portfolio over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> would have accumulated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 127,446</NUMEX> .
     Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation .
     Accepted theories state that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> require higher returns on riskier investments .
     Thus , rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal , I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk .
     I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> is very large .
     If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return , I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk , as I am sure your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> do .
     Your hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk .
     Moreover , your hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk .
     This means the returns can vary a great deal .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorfman</ENAMEX> provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of dart <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">throwers</ENAMEX> would have accumulated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 112,383</NUMEX> by randomly selecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> new stocks to be held in a portfolio <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott E. Hein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Texas Tech University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lubbock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> Your Investment Dartboard article misses the target .
     The fact that stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickers</ENAMEX> have bested a randomly selected portfolio in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight of 12 months</TIMEX> has no bearing on the efficient-market theory .
     What matters is that the stocks recommended by your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio .
     For example , your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickers</ENAMEX> ' recommendations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming month</TIMEX> are , on average , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.5 %</NUMEX> riskier than holding the market portfolio according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Value Line</ENAMEX> 's Beta estimates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Morgan</ENAMEX> 's pick for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dynascan</ENAMEX> -- is a substantial <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> riskier than the market portfolio ; his lauded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thermo Electron</ENAMEX> pick is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> riskier .

     BEING A TRAVEL <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> used to be pretty glamorous .
     Now it 's getting downright dangerous .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> have been robbed , compared with only a handful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">all last year</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and travel-agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> .
     Most of the cases have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was stabbed and another was shot and killed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> seem to be part of a crime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">network</ENAMEX> that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones .
     Already , the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world .
     So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> have stolen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,632</NUMEX> blank tickets , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Airline Reporting Corp.</ENAMEX> , a ticket processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> say the robberies are usually pulled off by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , who walk into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> near closing or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</TIMEX> , when few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are there .
     `` They looked like ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willy LLerena</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travel Air Service</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Monte Bello</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , describing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who entered his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> .
     But then , he says , they put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> loaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">pistols</ENAMEX> to his temple and demanded he open the safe .
     When he initially refused , he says , they stabbed him in the back and made off with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,000</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> blank tickets .
     `` They said they wanted to show me how serious they were , '' he says .
     As word of the crime spree has spread , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have started changing their open-door policies .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">El Monte Travel Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">El Monte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system .
     `` It 's hard to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> this way in a service business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph `` Bud '' Conner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , which was robbed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> blank tickets and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 850</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     `` But we 're just too nervous . ''
     The robberies also have set off a controversy involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> , which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets , should be doing more to catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> by confiscating the tickets when they 're used .
     `` They have the most sophisticated computers in the world , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LLerena</ENAMEX> .
     `` They ought to be able to do this . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> Get Reasonable Car Rental Insurance
     CONSUMER <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> have long claimed that car rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> charge too much for car rental insurance .
     Now , a new law in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> seems to be providing the proof .
     The law -- the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of its kind -- requires car rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> to charge only `` reasonable '' rates for collision-damage waiver insurance .
     Specifically , the law says the rates must closely reflect what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     Before the law went into effect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , car rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> were charging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 12</NUMEX> a day for the waiver in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
     Now , they 're charging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little $ 3</NUMEX> a day .
     `` If they 're telling the truth now , then they 've been charging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300 %</NUMEX> more than what is reasonable , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Gardner</ENAMEX> , an assistant state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz Corp.</ENAMEX> acknowledges , `` The waiver is n't a source of protection for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> , but a source of revenue . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hertz</ENAMEX> points out that at least it 's now charging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 3.95</NUMEX> a day in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , while some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> are charging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.99</NUMEX> .

     Flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attendants</ENAMEX> Lag Before <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Jets</ENAMEX> Even Land
     IF YOUR FLIGHT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant</ENAMEX> seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 straight hours</TIMEX> .
     A recent study for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> found that major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> sometimes make flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> or more straight -- despite union contracts at some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> limiting duty time to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 hours</TIMEX> .
     Some flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> on charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> are putting in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">work days</TIMEX> , the study found .
     This happens because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FAA</ENAMEX> does n't have any rules on duty time for flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> ; by contrast , it strictly restricts duty time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and air traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> , usually to a maximum of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 consecutive hours</TIMEX> .
     `` As far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FAA</ENAMEX> is concerned , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Finucane</ENAMEX> , air safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Association of Flight Attendants</ENAMEX> , `` flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> can work an unlimited number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> say <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">such long hours</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> pose a safety risk .
     For instance , tired flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation .
     `` At the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">their day</TIMEX> , they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zombies</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Galipault</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Aviation Safety Institute</ENAMEX> , a public-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Worthington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .

     Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation ?
     Why do you maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ?
     I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
     Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 29</TIMEX> page-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed capital-gains plan is a good example .
     You lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> reduced the capital-gains tax for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> only .
     You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation , which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate .
     The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation rate , times basis for the gain .
     Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6 %</NUMEX> rate without indexation .
     But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both systems .
     As you can see , the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> would not be temporary , but permanent .
     I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .

     That the motivation for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> reduction to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.6 %</NUMEX> is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest .
     The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses .
     But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense .
     A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation .
     Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> really believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ?
     Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption .
     Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % or 2 %</NUMEX> a year .
     The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .

     Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">poisons</ENAMEX> are capable of inducing an immunity to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">whooping cough</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Science</ENAMEX> .
     The current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccine</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">whooping cough</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pertussis</ENAMEX> , is part of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DPT</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pertussis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tetanus</ENAMEX> -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">shot</ENAMEX> given most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccine</ENAMEX> is effective in preventing a disease that still afflicts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a year world-wide , causing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated one million</NUMEX> deaths .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccine</ENAMEX> , however , causes allergic reactions that can be fatal .
     The reactions stem from the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccine</ENAMEX> contains multiple copies of the whole Bordetella pertussis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacterium</ENAMEX> , which causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">whooping cough</ENAMEX> .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacterium</ENAMEX> produces a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> that , if used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccine</ENAMEX> , can induce immunity to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">whooping cough</ENAMEX> .
     Unfortunately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> is also poisonous .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-led scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> said they had succeeded in getting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> , which could be used as a safe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccine</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reported they have been able to pluck the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> that produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> out of the pertussis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacterium</ENAMEX> .
     It turned out that although it took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> to produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> was responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> 's virulence .
     Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> , minus the one that caused the virulence , would have been transferred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacterium</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">E. coli</ENAMEX> , which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> said they did this , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> did n't induce immunity to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">whooping cough</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> then took the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> toxin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> and triggered a mutation in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gene</ENAMEX> that caused virulence .
     Then , using a new technique -LRB- called homologous recombination -RRB- for introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cells</ENAMEX> , they transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> closely related to the pertussis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">organism</ENAMEX> .
     These bacterial `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cousins</ENAMEX> '' ordinarily do n't make the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> were accompanied by a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> , called a promoter , that turns the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> on .
     The new bacteria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">recipients</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">genes</ENAMEX> began producing pertussis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> which , because of the mutant virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gene</ENAMEX> , was no longer toxic .
     Experiments showed that the new , non-virulent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> is capable of inducing immunity , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Selavo Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Siena</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Medical College of Wisconsin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Japanese National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1796</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer Amschel Rothschild</ENAMEX> founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild &amp; Sons</ENAMEX> and later sent his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vienna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Naples</ENAMEX> to begin the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's expansion during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX> .
     The original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> closed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1901</TIMEX> after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's banking activities focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elie de Rothschild</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , explains that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berlin</ENAMEX> had replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> 's financial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">center</ENAMEX> .
     Yet the chief reason for the closure , he says , was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to bear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> name without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     `` At the time we had only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> , '' explains the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">72-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX> , `` so we had to close the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> . ''
     Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's mystique remained .
     Although its palatial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> was destroyed by bombs during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> ' place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> 's history is still recalled by the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> bearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> name .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's long absence is understandable .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allied</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> during both <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War I</ENAMEX> and the long period of economic strife of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> .
     During the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Third Reich</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazi</ENAMEX> propaganda against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> .
     The persecution pursued the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazis</ENAMEX> grabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , confiscating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's property in the process .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William L. Shirer</ENAMEX> , in his book `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</ENAMEX> , '' wrote of how in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vienna</ENAMEX> he had witnessed `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squads</ENAMEX> of -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazi</ENAMEX> -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> carting off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> , tapestries , paintings and other loot from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">palace</ENAMEX> . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the immediate postwar years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> concentrated on rebuilding their other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , delaying their return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> .
     `` For a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> , the return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> is a very meaningful event , although it might not mean as much to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> banking as it means to us , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David de Rothschild</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elie</ENAMEX> 's younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rothschild &amp; Cie . Banque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , the competition is n't greatly concerned .
     `` It would be surprising if they did n't come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> in time for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , and they bring an interesting tradition .
     But the market really is n't going to be stood on its head , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> 's Big Three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     The return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> is modest .
     The new representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , with one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> -- none a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> -- will carry out no banking operations of its own .
     Instead , it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's mainstay banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rothschild &amp; Cie.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rothschild Bank AG</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> .
     The constraints do n't bother the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">54-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Stromeyer</ENAMEX> .

''
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschild</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> is linked by family ties and cross-ownership .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">N M Rothschild</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rothschild Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> showed assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 4.1 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.51 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.26 billion Swiss francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 774 million</NUMEX> -RRB- , respectively .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> does n't publish that figure .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> industry restructures ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's limited resources makes it a niche <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> .
     `` Obviously , there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David de Rothschild</ENAMEX> , `` but we feel we have some cards to play . ''

     As program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations , a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on Wall Street say it is time to consider extreme measures .
     The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures .
     A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard &amp; Poor 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index .
     Since stock futures were created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves .
     The conventional view , as voiced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> partner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fischer Black</ENAMEX> , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . ''
     But increasingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are questioning that view , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> include some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's most successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX> has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . ''
     Like others , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli</ENAMEX> says that if futures cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done .
     And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> . ''
     Essentially , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of stock-index futures fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> camps .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital .
     `` Before futures , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Harkins</ENAMEX> , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value . ''
     While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> now routinely check the futures markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> before they buy or sell stocks .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures prices jump up or down , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> follows .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , for instance , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">little more than an hour</TIMEX> .
     Then , in the space of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> coffee break , the average rallied almost all of the way back .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lesutis</ENAMEX> , who manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 billion</NUMEX> of investments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Provident Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , blames futures markets for leading the way .
     `` The fundamentals do n't change in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     `` I think they should close down the futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> and then we could get back to investing . ''
     Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility .
     Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bachmann</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edward D. Jones</ENAMEX> , says too much liquidity is n't a good thing
     `` The kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> and get out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day</TIMEX> .
     It 's too disruptive , '' he says .
     `` It is n't investing . ''
     But stock-index futures have plenty of support .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defenders</ENAMEX> say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to reduce risks .
     They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
     And , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> say , few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> complain about futures when stock prices are rising .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Margolis</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in charge of equity options and futures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> , says that trading baskets of stocks began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> before the advent of futures .
     Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs .
     He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> . ''
     Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says .
     Futures `` do n't need defending , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Yemma</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , which trades the S&amp;P 500 , by far the largest stock-index futures contract .
     Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> expect stock futures to disappear .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> have political and financial clout -- including many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape .
     `` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     `` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> . ''
     Average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume in S&amp;P 500 futures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,877</NUMEX> contracts .
     Based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's closing price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> , the average value of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day</TIMEX> 's trading amounts to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.6 billion</NUMEX> .

     Many investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can speculate in futures with little money down .
     Margin requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> are currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7 %</NUMEX> .
     `` For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> , you can move <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> of stocks , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> gripes .
     `` That gives futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> a lot more power . ''
     By contrast , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> in stocks must put up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> in cash .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say futures encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most .
     The S&amp;P <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> index futures `` transferred the identity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stocks into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unit - making them a simple commodity to trade , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Kegler</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A. Webster Dougherty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
     `` It took away the need to know the bad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> report of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , for example , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kegler</ENAMEX> says .
     Of course , portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities .
     `` There is a class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> that wants to be exposed '' to the whole market , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandip Bhagat</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers Investment Management Co</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stocks , he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&amp;P <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stocks .
     But owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stockholders</ENAMEX> , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices .
     Futures , on the other hand , are a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
     `` You do n't own anything , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .

     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will be notified so they can begin negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> on how to modify the pact .
     At issue is an accord dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> gained access to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> routes under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Inter</ENAMEX> 's flight numbers and the domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> got to fly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> under the flag of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shared results from this route swap , and followed rules on ticket pricing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC Commission</ENAMEX> decided that such an accord does n't benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> presented it as offering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> more choice and better flight connections .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said , `` we 're absolutely ready to study all solutions . ''

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> move follows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's declaration by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , which holds an unwelcome <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.45 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , that it is prepared to bid for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> is close to completing a friendly deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> that is likely to involve an eventual <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> stake and joint manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> .
     Speculative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , betting on an imminent clash between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , pushed up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's share price <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight U.S. cents</NUMEX> -RRB- to a near-record <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">720 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.60</NUMEX> -RRB- in late trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .

     `` We will not go over a certain level , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David N.

     `` I really do n't see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> doing something that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> does n't want over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next 14 months</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Warren</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Select Committee on Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Commons</ENAMEX> .
     `` The golden share is a single share , but it is the magic share . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> retained the single share after selling its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> to deflect criticism of privatization .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> restriction covers any would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> or foreign .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is willing to bid for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's shares if both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> could turn up the heat by convening a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ' meeting and urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> to drop the limits early .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> might succeed because many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> keen for a full bid or institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> unhappy over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> 's handling of its current financial difficulties .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> probably would n't give in readily to a hostile foray by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , however .
     It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 2.5 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Britoil PLC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     In wooing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-owned and independent .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> paid for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Commons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Lords</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> and tour its operations there .
     While the visit was unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Smith</ENAMEX> answered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> ' questions about it over lunch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .

     Politics also influences the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservatives</ENAMEX> do n't dare jeopardize marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Tory</ENAMEX> seats in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Coventry</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> , nor can the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> easily back down on promised protection for a privatized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's water and electricity industries .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> might , however , be receptive to any request by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Egan</ENAMEX> for the restriction 's early removal to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> amass <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 15 %</NUMEX> or mount a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> bid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> .
     In the end , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> -- rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share .

     This may have been true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> , but times have changed , even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> no longer stands out as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> .
     He has not changed , but those around him have .
     Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas , rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream , conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Utahans</ENAMEX> .
     Recently , some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> environmental and outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> representing such divergent points of view as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">League of Women Voters</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX> joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Central Utah Project</ENAMEX> .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> is not yet a haven for environmentalism , public views toward the environment have significantly improved .

     Furthermore , his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">power-plant</ENAMEX> construction , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> mining or to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment , but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Wasatch Range</ENAMEX> into a ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">resort</ENAMEX> .
     It astounds me he can rationalize his self-righteous and greedy actions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> .

     `` I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtin Windsor</ENAMEX> , who served as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> , among other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> connected to the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX> , fears the gathering of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , mostly from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> , will force Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> `` to explain and redeem himself '' in the wake of charges that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> failed to do enough to aid the removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> and moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> note the irony of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's joining a celebration of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> democracy at a time his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has sought sharp cuts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 57 million</NUMEX> in so-called economic support funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , down from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 million</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> said improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> uses mainly to make payments on its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> foreign debt .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> argue that the recent drop in coffee prices , combined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's continuing struggle to reinvigorate its economy , make the support as necessary as ever .
     `` We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo Sotela</ENAMEX> , an economic affairs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> deserves more assistance for the same reason that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is attending the celebration <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> : to reward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
     However , peace efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Arias</ENAMEX> have n't always helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's cause in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX> 's long-time refusal to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's campaign against leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> earned him the ire of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> .
     And more recently , he insisted on signing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-nation agreement intended to disarm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> faster than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> would prefer .
     `` I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's going there is a helpful sign , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Sanford</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C .</ENAMEX> -RRB- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> who pushed to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> about the same amount of aid as it received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> support the higher level .
     Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> defend Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's decision to make the trip .
     While they acknowledge the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> , they insist that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wo n't be extending the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> any special courtesies .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , endorsing a package of electoral aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">opposition</ENAMEX> , renewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade embargo against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and continuing to complain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> supports rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">region</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> also insist Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region , fighting illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and assisting the less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     `` Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     `` There wo n't be any formal resolutions or communiques , I do n't think .
     But we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many , many very important issues .

<DOCNO> WSJ0749 </DOCNO>
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Presidents Commission</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCAA</ENAMEX> , which oversees most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intercollegiate sports , contracted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Institutes for Research</ENAMEX> to do a survey on the college experiences of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">body</ENAMEX> chooses to call <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student-athletes</ENAMEX> .
     A brief `` executive summary '' was issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> , and attracted some , but not much , attention .
     More-detailed reports followed , and attracted even less notice .
     I suspect I may be one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to have read them all .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> and last report now is out , and it puts the effort in perspective .
     Titled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Comments From Students</ENAMEX> , '' it focuses on the real shame of college sports : what happens to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> once they enter academe .
     It 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible .
     The previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> reports were mainly statistical , but clear enough in outline .
     They showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Division I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> , the big-time `` revenue sports , '' entered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> with poorer high-school grades and test scores than `` minor-sport '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jocks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who participated in other extracurricular activities , and they got lower grades once they got there , at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> spent more time on their sports in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season</TIMEX> than they did on class attendance and homework combined -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 hours</TIMEX> a week versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.3</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49.8 %</NUMEX> -RRB- reported suffering `` mental abuse '' from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one-quarter</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.8 %</NUMEX> -RRB- said they had been pressured to ignore injuries .
     But even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> do in their own words .
     The composite portrait that emerges is n't of a pampered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jock</ENAMEX> marking time until he can land a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-figure pro contract -- he 's part of a tiny minority .
     Rather , it 's of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> -LRB- we 're talking about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">17 to 22 year olds</TIMEX> here -RRB- having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shot at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> .
     The pertinent question , coming at the end of a lengthy , confidential questionnaire , was this : `` Are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about ? ''
     Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> surveyed , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,240</NUMEX> took the time to respond .
     Here are a few of their answers : -- `` They say that I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student-athlete</ENAMEX> , but really I 'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete-student</ENAMEX> .
     They lied to me on the recruiting trip .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Football</ENAMEX> is the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> thing here '' . -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` Being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student-athlete</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> is a lot different from high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , the sport you play is no longer a game -- it becomes a job .
     Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress .
     You become expendable .
     Your interest is not taken to heart because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> only care about your performance '' . -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Freshman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> -- not treat us like pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> .
     They always say to get a degree <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , but they do n't allow us time or to skip practice to study for a test .
     They just want to get their job done at any cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> '' . -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Freshman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` The pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence , such as punching and slapping by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Some days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> make you feel as though you are part of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> .
     In other words , they treat you like a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> '' .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sophomore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` Playing intercollegiate sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others .
     We are almost left out of -LCB- campus -RCB- social activities .
     This mostly happens because we go from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall</TIMEX> to lifting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the winter</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring</TIMEX> '' . -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Freshman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` You talk about free time -- .what free time ?
     Time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> -LRB- meetings , lifting weights , conditioning or films -RRB- .
     There is no recovery period -- it 's go , go , go .
     ABUSE to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> is overwhelming .
     With our schedule , it 's hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next day</TIMEX> '' .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` Physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teammates</ENAMEX> ' lives '' . -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> , class unspecified .
     -- `` More often than not , college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> go through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> never really experiencing collegiate life to the fullest .
     One has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part , not a whole , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student-athlete</ENAMEX> 's life '' . -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sophomore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     -- `` Somehow , and I do n't know how , the game needs to be played for fun again , and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative TV contracts '' .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Graduate-student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> .
     There have been rumblings that , at long last , changes may be in the works .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Knight Foundation</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Akron</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , has established a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">commission</ENAMEX> to look into college-sports reform , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCAA Presidents Commission</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> recommended cutting spring football practice in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> , moving the start of basketball practice back by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> games from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> .
     The key word in that paragraph , though , is `` may . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCAA</ENAMEX> Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schultz</ENAMEX> , in accepting a place on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Knight Commission</ENAMEX> , urged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> take a `` balanced '' view , which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boat</ENAMEX> too much , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCAA</ENAMEX> 's full convention in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , which will vote on them .
     I read that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unnamed athletics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> predicted that the basketball-cutback proposal could fail because of `` real world '' -LRB- i.e. , economic -RRB- considerations .
     But the `` real world '' also includes the unpleasant truth that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> are cheating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> they have wooed and won .
     If they wo n't change their ways voluntarily , maybe somebody bigger -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> -- should make them .
