     Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinpoint</ENAMEX> 's computers pick the most relevant for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> and lay them out in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-to-five</NUMEX>-page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> 's fax machine .

     Many computer network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
     So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
     `` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Digate</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus Development</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who has started a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to cope with the problem .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digate</ENAMEX> says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beyond Inc.</ENAMEX> , has licensed technology known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Information Lens</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> and plans to develop it for commercial use .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">MIT</ENAMEX> project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senders</ENAMEX> or requires action in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next couple of days</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digate</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beyond</ENAMEX> will refine the product `` so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> . ''
     And if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is busy , `` he can set it for crisis mode : ` Do n't bother me with reports until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> . ' ''
     A program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Notes</ENAMEX> , which is under development by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> , also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Notes</ENAMEX> , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> news briefing from the company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have .

     Now that a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Diego Yacht Club</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> is splitting off to form his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , even more competition lies ahead .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Isler</ENAMEX> , the winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> in the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">America 's Cup</ENAMEX> challenges , has split from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Conner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skipper</ENAMEX> of the victorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Stars & Stripes</ENAMEX> , to form his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> for the next contest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     And , in addition to a crack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> has lined up some real brass to help him finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Isler Sailing International</ENAMEX> 's advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Cup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victor</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter G. Diamandis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Diamandis Communications</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph B. Vittoria </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis Inc .</ENAMEX>
     His steering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> includes other notable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> and old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy E. Disney </ENAMEX>.
     `` We have the structure , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and plan , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> said in a statement .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order of business is raising enough money to keep his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> afloat -- a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">yacht</ENAMEX> will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3 million</NUMEX> alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Cup</ENAMEX> challenge .
     The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Diego Yacht Club</ENAMEX> should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">catamaran</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">challengers</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">90-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">monohull</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> appellate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> overturned a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's ruling that awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Cup</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> .
     Pending an appeal by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Fay </ENAMEX>, the finals for the next <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Cup</ENAMEX> challenge are scheduled to be held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1992</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> .
     But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title .
     `` If you do n't know what the rules of the game are , it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dana Smith</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Team Dennis Conner</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsors</ENAMEX> until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate</ENAMEX> 's budget could easily reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesmen</ENAMEX> for both Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> say the formation of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">syndicate</ENAMEX> has to do with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> 's desire to skipper his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> and begin planning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> , rather than any falling out between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportsmen</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">America 's Cup Organizing Committee</ENAMEX> insist that the added competition for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">defender</ENAMEX> 's spot will only improve the race .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blake Hurst</ENAMEX> writing in the fall issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Policy Review</ENAMEX> about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">incinerator</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> :
     Of course I 'd rather have a computer software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in my backyard than a hazardous waste <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">incinerator</ENAMEX> .
     But I 'd also rather live next door to an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">incinerator</ENAMEX> than to some of the hog <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">farms</ENAMEX> I 've seen -LRB- and smelt -RRB- in these parts .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">incinerator</ENAMEX> is also probably better than having nobody next door -- on our farm there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> unoccupied <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> .
     On my <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">four-mile</NUMEX> drive to farm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> , I drive by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another four</NUMEX> empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">farmsteads</ENAMEX> , failing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , and crumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> is hardly a desirable one ... .
     The loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> jobs by a depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> is hardly of national importance except for this : If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Atchinson County</ENAMEX> , what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces ?
     After all , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> here work with `` hazardous '' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> , many of them the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> that would have been destroyed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">incinerator</ENAMEX> .
     We know they are dangerous , but if handled with care , their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .

     Just because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">High School</ENAMEX> did nothing when its valuable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1930s</TIMEX> mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> no longer owns the work of art , a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> ruled .
     The mural , now valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 million</NUMEX> according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appraisers</ENAMEX> , was tossed in a trash heap in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who were renovating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">100-foot-long</NUMEX> mural , painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Daugherty</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1934</TIMEX> , was commissioned by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Works Project Administration</ENAMEX> .
     After the discarded mural was found outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> by a concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stamford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> , it eventually was turned over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiram Hoelzer</ENAMEX> , a professional art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restorer</ENAMEX> .
     Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> school and city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> made no effort to locate the mural .
     Apparently the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> did n't even know the mural was missing until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> found that the painting was in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoelzer</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">studio</ENAMEX> and questioned school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> about it .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> thanked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoelzer</ENAMEX> for taking care of the mural -- and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoelzer</ENAMEX> , however , sued <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , claiming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis L. Stanton</ENAMEX> of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> that its ownership of the painting was in dispute .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX> had discarded it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoelzer</ENAMEX> did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's decision .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> ordered that a hearing be held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 17</TIMEX> to determine how much the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> should pay Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoelzer</ENAMEX> for his services .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary E. Sommer</ENAMEX> , corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural , which portrays various scenes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression</ENAMEX> .
     She said the mural `` preserves an era in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> and in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> when this type of work was being done .

     The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is keeping up its dizzying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> buying binge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> .
     Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> announced that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> had bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">1.2 million metric tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> , bringing their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> purchases confirmed so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about five million metric tons</NUMEX> .
     In trading at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> , the corn contract for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.75 cents</NUMEX> a bushel to settle at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.44</NUMEX> a bushel .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> purchases are close to exceeding what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to buy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the season</TIMEX> in which it usually buys much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> it imports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     That pace is causing some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> to speculate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> might soon purchase <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">as much as another two million metric tons</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> sign that more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> purchases are possible is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> grain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
     That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> .
     By some estimates , several grain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> combined bought contracts for the possession of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">roughly one million metric tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> .
     By buying futures contracts , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> that they are obligated to deliver .
     Rumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts .
     Among other things , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oil</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     On top of all this , corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">several inches</NUMEX> in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
     The harvest delays , however , are expected to be temporary .
     Balmy temperatures are forecast for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lekberg</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> to grain elevator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     The heavy selling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> helped to damp the price rally .
     Wheat futures prices rose slightly .
     In other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> :
     PRECIOUS METALS :
     Futures prices declined .
     A number of developments were negatively interpreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.80</NUMEX> an ounce to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 370.60</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> eased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7 cents</NUMEX> an ounce to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.133</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> was down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.60</NUMEX> an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 491.10</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2 %</NUMEX> in the consumer price index for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     He noted that the `` core inflation rate , '' which excludes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> and energy , was also low at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> .
     Other news that weighed on the market : Initial unemployment claims rose by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> will reduce its managerial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> through attrition ; the oil market turned weaker ; there was n't any investor demand for bullion ; and the dollar strengthened during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , putting pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> .
     Also , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said , economic circumstances are such that both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> , are being forced to continue selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> .
     Both are in great need of foreign exchange , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said .
     `` Putting it all together , we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">COPPER</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices recovered in quiet trading .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.50 cents</NUMEX> a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2795</NUMEX> .
     That contract fell a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.75 cents</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first three days</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , mostly in reaction to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's stock market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy and thus reduced demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> , a leading industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metal</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , however , there has been increased purchasing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     Some of this buying was by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bougainville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , which are major shippers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The increasing likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing , but even if any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> begin operating soon , their output wo n't be significant until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at least the end of the year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> note .
     So , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said , even though the long-term production problems may be easing , there will still be a significant need for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three months</TIMEX> , when inventories will remain relatively low .
     ENERGY :
     Crude oil prices ended mixed .
     West Texas Intermediate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 cents</NUMEX> a barrel to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.42</NUMEX> .
     But so-called outer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> contracts finished higher .
     For instance , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contracts for WTI rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.42</NUMEX> .
     Most energy futures opened lower , following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> 's market downturn .
     But a flurry of late trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> beefed up prices .
     Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .

     Suits are likely to be filed against engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> , as well as against local-government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> tort law say protections afforded government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> in such cases are pretty ironclad .
     Even claims against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> face significant roadblocks .
     The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an `` act of God . ''
     For now , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Drivon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president-elect</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">California Trial Lawyers Association</ENAMEX> , `` the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not .
     We still have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wandering around in a daze in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> worrying about whether it 's going to rain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> . ''
     But that wo n't stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> from seeking a little room for maneuvering .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty .
     Therefore , engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> can be sued for not keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structures</ENAMEX> up to standard , and government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> can be held accountable for failing to properly protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> from such a foreseeable disaster , if negligence can be proven .
     `` My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Chesley</ENAMEX> , a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> plaintiffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> .
     From what he saw on television , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chesley</ENAMEX> points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate 880</ENAMEX> , which collapsed and killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> , suffered serious damage while surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever .
     He adds that `` they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Andreas Fault</ENAMEX> . ''
     The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belli</ENAMEX> says he already has <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">interstate</ENAMEX> approaching it .
     `` We wo n't know until the smoke clears -- but yes , we 're looking into it , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belli</ENAMEX> says he wants to know whether state or federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> or private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> could have prevented the damage .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belli</ENAMEX> , who was at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , says he has hired civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> to check out his own mildly damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> and to investigate the bridge collapse .
     Defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , perhaps understandably , say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually .
     `` A lot of this is going to be code-related , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ignazio J. Ruvolo</ENAMEX> , a construction law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bronson , Bronson & McKinnon</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Plaintiffs</ENAMEX> , he says , will argue that damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structures</ENAMEX> were n't built to proper design standards .
     But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> can prove that they met <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's stringent building codes , `` that 's probably going to protect them , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruvolo</ENAMEX> says .
     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">entities</ENAMEX> , continues Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruvolo</ENAMEX> , could be protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">California Government Tort Liability Act</ENAMEX> .
     Under the statute , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> are provided `` defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruvolo</ENAMEX> says .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">entities</ENAMEX> to liability . ''
     Built into the statute are so-called design immunities , which are likely to protect government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruvolo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Covert</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> , which oversees the damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> is protected when plans and designs for public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structures</ENAMEX> were approved ahead of time or when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structures</ENAMEX> met previously approved standards , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covert </ENAMEX>.
     He believes those defenses might well apply to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> collapse .
     Nevertheless , he adds , `` I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> . ''
     If there 's going to be a race to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courthouse</ENAMEX> , it has n't started yet .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covert</ENAMEX> had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belli</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">courtyard</ENAMEX> was strewn with bricks .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belli</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was n't permitted into his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> by city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> worried about their safety .
     He said he set up shop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">sidewalk</ENAMEX> in front of his town-house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> and helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> apply for federal aid -- free of charge .
     In a news release issued by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drivon</ENAMEX> , the trial lawyers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> also promised free assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> said it would monitor the conduct of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and warned that solicitation of business is unethical .

     What if it happened to us ?
     In the wake of the earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> and the devastation of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness .
     Some , particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> earthquake zones , are dusting off their evacuation plans , checking food stocks and reminding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of what to do if emergency strikes .
     Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster .
     Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     Some big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of in-house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> focusing on safety and business resumption .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in safe regions , hoping they can transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> there and resume operations quickly .
     That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> -- like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Disneyland</ENAMEX> -- claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis , they would be able to feed and care for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as long as five days</TIMEX> .
     `` Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanie Masaki-Schatz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of corporate emergency planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .

     Retail advertising , which often represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the advertising volume at most <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> , largely is n't rebounding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half</TIMEX> from extended doldrums as expected .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> are bedeviled by lagging national advertising , especially in its financial component .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones & Co.</ENAMEX> recently reported net fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.9 %</NUMEX> , a reflection , in part , of continued softness in financial advertising at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barron 's</ENAMEX> magazine .
     `` We expect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a fairly soft year</TIMEX> in newspaper-industry advertising , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Morton</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lynch , Jones & Ryan </ENAMEX>.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> celebrated the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds .
     But the dollar was mixed .
     Stock and bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were cheered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's encouragingly low inflation rate .
     This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX>-bond prices immediately rallied , setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mid-afternoon</TIMEX> , finished with a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39.55</NUMEX> points , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2683.20</NUMEX> .
     That brought the average 's cumulative gain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 114</NUMEX> points .
     Since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , the industrials have soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 54 %</NUMEX> , and the widely watched market barometer is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4 %</NUMEX> below its record high set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> .
     The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues , but , unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's rebound , was broadly based .
     Indeed , over-the-counter stocks , led by technology issues , outleaped the industrial average .
     The Nasdaq Composite Index soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.52</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">470.80</NUMEX> , its highest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> jump in points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Among the biggest winners were brokerage-house stocks , responding to heavy trading volume .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> said consumer prices rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> expected twice as large an increase .
     That news , plus recent signs of economic sluggishness , greatly increases pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease credit further , which in turn would be good news for stocks , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say .
     `` I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy , and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garnett L. Keith Jr.</ENAMEX> , vice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> probably wo n't drive down rates immediately , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith</ENAMEX> said .
     Despite the inflation news , several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed .
     But Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few weeks</TIMEX> .
     If so , that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month or so</TIMEX> .
     That , in turn , is expected to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to cut their prime lending rate , a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans , by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a percentage point , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     `` We 're not out of the woods yet by any means , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George R.

     But the economy `` is slowing enough to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> leeway to reduce interest rates . ''
     But many individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> also are anxious about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's `` <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">witching hour</TIMEX> , '' the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks .
     This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's rout of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hopeful</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> district that has n't backed a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adlai Stevenson</ENAMEX> is another reminder that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has been on the rise over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past half century</TIMEX> .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">presidential election year</TIMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1948</TIMEX> did more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's congressional districts choose a different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> than for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives </ENAMEX>.
     Now that percentage routinely equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> and twice has been above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> .
     As we know , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> tend to favor <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> more in races for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> than in those for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     In every presidential election over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past half century</TIMEX> , except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldwater</ENAMEX> presidential candidacy , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Prior to 1932</TIMEX> , the pattern was nearly the opposite .
     What accounts for the results of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent decades</TIMEX> ?
     A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in the voting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">booth</ENAMEX> .
     The theory relies on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> assumptions :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> can `` buy '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> brands when they select their political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> brand that believes in big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     If these assumptions hold , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in races for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> face what in economic theory is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> .
     If they put a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> will be relatively powerless to prevent other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> from `` bringing home the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bacon</ENAMEX> '' to their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituencies</ENAMEX> .
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> , after all , is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">535</NUMEX> when it comes to national policy making .
     In races for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> 's incentive , at the margin , is to lean <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> .
     Although a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> may limit local benefits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> 's particular district\/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is also likely to be more effective at preventing other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> from bringing home the local benefits .
     The individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes .
     While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past half century</TIMEX> : Prior to the election of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Roosevelt</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> 's dilemma problem confronting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in races for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> was considerably less severe .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , it explains why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in disdain but generally love their own congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> : Any individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> appreciate the specific benefits that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> doing likewise for his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> , the theory suggests why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
     For example , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , once the most vulnerable of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbents</ENAMEX> , have become virtually immune to defeat .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception to this recent trend was the defeat of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> freshman <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> brought into office in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> revolution and running for re-election in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     Because these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freshmen</ENAMEX> placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX> , the theory indicates why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Republican Party</ENAMEX> may have a difficult time attracting viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for congressional office .
     Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> .
     To the extent that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and their financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> realize that the congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Republican Party</ENAMEX> will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX> , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> .
     To the extent that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> have held a disproportionate share of power in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1932</TIMEX> and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituencies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> have had an especially strong incentive to keep such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> in office .
     Finally , the theory suggests why <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> generally have fared better in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> races than in campaigns for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> .
     Is there any empirical support for this theory ?
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bennett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas DiLorenzo</ENAMEX> find that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> turn back <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 10 %</NUMEX> more of their allocated personal staff budgets than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> do .
     To the extent that the primary duty of personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> to pay less attention to narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> concerns .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , if the key assumption is valid , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .
     This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> attendance rate has not exceeded the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> attendance rate since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1959</TIMEX> .
     Finally , as shown in the table , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> allocate a higher proportion of their personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> to district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> .
     An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1986 and 1987</TIMEX> -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> .
     An additional piece of evidence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential and senatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> conducting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's tax burden is per <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> harder -RRB- .
     Put more simply , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> are looked on more kindly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> 's dilemma is more severe .
     Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> level as it does at the federal level .
     State <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is more typically split along <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> lines than the reverse .
     A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's major-party vote going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> gubernatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> share of the lower state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">house</ENAMEX> is a positive function of the state tax rate .
     In sum , at both the federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> display in the voting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">booth</ENAMEX> may have an exceedingly rational explanation .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nearly $ 17 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> bill that makes federal reparations for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese-Americans</ENAMEX> held in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> internment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">camps</ENAMEX> a legal entitlement after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Oct. 1</TIMEX> .
     The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then , but beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would be committed to meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> payments of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 500 million</NUMEX> until the total liability of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25 billion</NUMEX> is paid .
     The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments , but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> authorized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     The action came as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> bill providing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 156.7 billion</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Departments of Labor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Education</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> .
     Final approval was on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> roll call in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     Reversing an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight-year</TIMEX> federal policy , the measure supports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> abortions in cases of rape and incest , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> 's life is in danger .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill .
     The measure before the conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> funds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Departments of State</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     An estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.32 billion</NUMEX> is provided for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> 's census , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> stripped a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX>-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> .
     Elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> , nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.2 million</NUMEX> is preserved for assistance programs under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Economic Development Administration </ENAMEX>.
     And in a footnote to the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the conference voted to rescind <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.8 million</NUMEX> in unspent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EDA</ENAMEX> funds for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> , and an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> 's budget would be financed entirely by an added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 million</NUMEX> in filing fees .
     In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> in receipts by having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> costs in processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and security clearances .
     The bill does n't include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> in supplemental anti-drug funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's agreement would make it easier for state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> to handle the promised aid by deferring for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> a scheduled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants .
     Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Delaware</ENAMEX> a minimum allocation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 million</NUMEX> each in drug grants , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the current minimum .
     The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the more eclectic of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> run from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</NUMEX> for a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">farm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> to a music festival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">United States Information Agency</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> scrapped all of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> request for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Expo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> , but agreed elsewhere to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> for an oil portrait of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Burger</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hollings</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who also chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> , attached <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.H.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legal Services Corp .</ENAMEX>
     An estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 321 million</NUMEX> is provided to maintain the program , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudman</ENAMEX> also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> until new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are confirmed .
     The effective date of any new regulations by the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> would be delayed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1 next year</TIMEX> , and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> to cut off funds to service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Food Research and Action Center</ENAMEX> .
     The bill also provides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 620.5 million</NUMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> contributions to international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 million</NUMEX> for peace-keeping activities .
     Both accounts reflect significant increases from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> , although the amount for peace-keeping shows a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> cut from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's request .

     Watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sweat and grimace through its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> budget labors , fighting the urge to spend more , we 're reminded of those <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-night</TIMEX> movies in which the anguished serial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> turns himself in to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and says , `` Stop me before I kill again . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> know they 're doing wrong , but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Pryor</ENAMEX> spilled his guts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> floor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the other day</TIMEX> after he 'd joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early-morning</TIMEX> pork-barrel revels : `` I must tell you ...
     I come to the floor <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter .
     It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy . ''
     He was turning himself in .
     `` Frankly , as I was walking back to get in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , I heard many , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ... opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for slipping this in , '' he said .
     `` As I was driving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , I did not feel very good about myself . ''
     We can applaud Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX> 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confreres</ENAMEX> need restraint lest they kill again .
     A good place to start the rehabilitation is a `` legislative line-item veto '' bill now being offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Coats</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coats</ENAMEX> bill , which already has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-sponsors</ENAMEX> , is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills .
     Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items that just go too far .
     Under the proposal , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> would have a chance twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> to return a package of `` rescissions '' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hill</ENAMEX> -- once when he proposes his budget and again after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> disposes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> would have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 days</TIMEX> to reject the package with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> majority , but then a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> could veto that rejection .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> would then need the usual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> majority to override any veto .
     The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1974 Budget `` Reform '' Act</ENAMEX> .
     Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presidents Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> were both big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the impoundment power , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> saw its chance against a weakened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> and stripped it away .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> can still send up spending rescissions , but they 're meaningless unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has a guilty conscience and changes its mind .
     This is like asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">foxes</ENAMEX> to feel remorse about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> , and naturally rescissions are almost never approved .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> rescissions back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hill</ENAMEX> , but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3 %</NUMEX> of the spending total was approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coats</ENAMEX> 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> acts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> could still try to serve their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> with special-interest goodies , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> -LRB- in the form of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> -RRB- would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy , as they do now .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coats</ENAMEX> plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> .

     Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake-ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> would total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> .

     Securities-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> were moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Concord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo & Co.</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Emergency Operations Committee</ENAMEX> -- which met <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> -- moved its global-funds transfer system to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">El Monte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">500 miles</NUMEX> to the south .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">496</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> statewide remain closed , while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> automated-teller machines remained out of order .
     The most extensive damage was in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> near the quake 's epicenter , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">80 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Santa Cruz County</ENAMEX> estimates total damage at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 600 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Santa Clara County</ENAMEX> has a running total so far of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 504 million</NUMEX> , excluding the hard-hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Gatos</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> ; a section of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">I-880</ENAMEX> , a twotiered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> , collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> , causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX> estimated that damages to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     That includes dwellings in the ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> district that must be demolished , peeled business facades south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Market Street</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's outer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Richmond</ENAMEX> district that were heaved off their foundations .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">sidewalks</ENAMEX> buckled , and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured .
     The federal funds would go to a range of programs , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Emergency Management Agency </ENAMEX>, highway construction accounts and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Small Business Administration </ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vic Fazio</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> , which coordinates federal disaster relief , is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , which hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     It is likely to get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 800 million</NUMEX> initially in additional funds , and eventually could get more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has at its disposal <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 273 million</NUMEX> in funds remaining from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> released for the cleanup after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     `` We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate , short-term requirements , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said .
     He added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Management and Budget </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> are `` developing longer-term legislation '' that should be ready soon .
     Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     Some things ca n't be repaired .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Asian Art Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Golden Gate Park</ENAMEX> reports <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million to $ 15 million</NUMEX> in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">neighbor</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">De Young Museum</ENAMEX> , totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million to $ 5 million</NUMEX> in structural damage and shattered sculpture .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">library</ENAMEX> is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls , and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Beaux Arts City Hall</ENAMEX> broke off in the temblor .
     The ground along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Embarcadero</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> that skirts the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's eastern boundary and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">piers</ENAMEX> -- dropped <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">six inches</NUMEX> after the quake , wreaking major damage to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">piers</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">San Francisco International Airport</ENAMEX> , shock waves wrecked the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> , knocking down computers and shattering glass .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Rent Board</ENAMEX> were destroyed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> estimate does n't include damage to freeway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">arteries</ENAMEX> leading into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> , some of which remained closed .
     A major chunk of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> deployed in the emergency , said a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos </ENAMEX>.
     `` All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> emergency reserve was spent in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</TIMEX> '' on overtime salaries , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</NUMEX> claims were received in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</TIMEX> after the quake , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is braced for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 5,000</NUMEX> claims from its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX> residential and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX> business policyholders in the affected area .
     `` Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> damaged in this -- to a major processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We 're delivering a check for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750,000</NUMEX> to an automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> that burned on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's</ENAMEX> is part of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicate</ENAMEX> that supplies business interruption insurance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , which must pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the three weeks</TIMEX> or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> want to eliminate temporarily a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> for each disaster , as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , under the highway-relief program , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> provides <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> of emergency highway aid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only the first 90 days</TIMEX> of a repair effort .
     After that , the federal share diminishes .
     For interstate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> , the federal share normally would drop to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> of the cost of repairs , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> would have to pick up the remainder of the cost .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> want to extend the period for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> federal funding for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months</TIMEX> .
     Those changes also would apply to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas hit hard by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">U.S. Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio </ENAMEX>.
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> announced a toll-free telephone number -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800-462-9029</ENAMEX> -RRB- to expedite service to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of the earthquake .
     Lines will be available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and growing worse over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next several weeks</TIMEX> .
     Some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> normally cross the closed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> is calling in a flotilla of navy landing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessels</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boats</ENAMEX> to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem .
     Moreover , state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are urging freight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haulers</ENAMEX> to bypass many of the area 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> and to travel <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> or during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">predawn hours</TIMEX> .
     Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gray</ENAMEX> , a deputy district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> .
     `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Idaho</ENAMEX> and go fishing for a while . ''
     Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> already have left -- despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> 's offers of rate cuts .
     `` Everyone left , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lang </ENAMEX>, reservations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Mark Hopkins Hotel</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Westin St. Francis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> , which survived the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> earthquake and fire , currently is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</NUMEX> occupied .
     `` We still have our die-hard baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` One <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> said she 's not going <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">home</ENAMEX> until the -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> -RCB- is over . ''
