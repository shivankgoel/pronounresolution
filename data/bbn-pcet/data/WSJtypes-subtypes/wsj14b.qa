     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> 's ability to produce more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">petroleum</ENAMEX> than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets .
     Output from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> is already at a high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> and most member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> are running flat out .
     But industry and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> agree that a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months from now</TIMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">cheaters</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , the effort by some oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> is taking on increasing urgency .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> is scheduled to meet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vienna</ENAMEX> beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 25</TIMEX> .
     So far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , rising demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> oil and production restraint by some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others .
     But that could change if demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> softens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seasonally early next year</TIMEX> as some think may happen .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> is currently producing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">more than 22 million barrels</NUMEX> a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> ceiling of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.5 million</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at an oil conference here sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oil Daily</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Herald Tribune</ENAMEX> .
     At that rate , a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC </ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> have reached their output limits , they said .
     But it is estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">at least three million barrels</NUMEX> a day -- and possibly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">as much as seven million barrels</NUMEX> a day -- of spare capacity still exists within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC </ENAMEX>.
     Most is concentrated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , including his own , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Issam Al-Chalabi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> , told the conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     He puts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> 's current capacity at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">28 million to 29 million barrels</NUMEX> a day .
     That 's higher than some other estimates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Kuwait </ENAMEX>'s oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> , recently estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> capacity at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">25 million barrels</NUMEX> a day .
     Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .
     Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iraq</ENAMEX> , could upset the market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hisham Nazer</ENAMEX> insisted in their comments to the conference that their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> would act responsibly to maintain a stable market .
     However , in interviews later , both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> stressed that they expect future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">member</ENAMEX> .
     Under that approach , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> 's production ceiling than they would under the current system .
     `` If you are already producing at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">105 %</NUMEX> of capacity ? '' asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Chalabi</ENAMEX> .
     At an inconclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC </ENAMEX>'s oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> halfheartedly approved another increase of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">one million barrels</NUMEX> a day in their production ceiling .
     They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> that could n't produce more received higher official allotments .
     The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">cheaters</ENAMEX> .
     Still , there was a breakthrough at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> .
     Previously , no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's total output target , or ceiling .
     But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> proposal , was generally endorsed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> .
     In the end politics got in the way .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Libya</ENAMEX> accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Kuwait </ENAMEX>.
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> , a chronic quota <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">cheater</ENAMEX> , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways .
     But the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> 's meeting .
     It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan .
     The ceiling would be lifted to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">21.5 million barrels</NUMEX> to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Libya</ENAMEX> 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> is still an issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">kingpin</ENAMEX> , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said .
     Insisting on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.5 %</NUMEX> share of any ceiling , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> , however , they supported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> 's proposal because it would have left the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> total intact , and increased actual <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> volume to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">nearly 5.3 million barrels</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> .
     Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">23,000 barrels</NUMEX> .
     Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazer </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> , reiterated here that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">kingdom</ENAMEX> would insist on maintaining its percentage share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> production under any quota revisions .
     `` Under any circumstances , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> should get more '' rather than less , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazer</ENAMEX> said .

     In a blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafale</ENAMEX> jet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fighter</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time publicly stated its desire to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-18 Hornets</ENAMEX> to defend its aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers</ENAMEX> .
     The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's military establishment over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafale</ENAMEX> , which is made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA</ENAMEX> .
     In an interview in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> 's official <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cols Bleus</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">second-in-command</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yves Goupil</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> still intends to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafales</ENAMEX> as scheduled in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1990s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 21st century</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">air force</ENAMEX> is to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 250</NUMEX> more .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> ca n't wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> , when the naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafale</ENAMEX> becomes available , to replace its obsolete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , used since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers</ENAMEX> from attack .
     Rather than renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Dassault</ENAMEX> is proposing to do for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1.8 billion French francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 286.6 million</NUMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> wants to buy used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-18s</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> .
     Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafale</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said that when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-18s</ENAMEX> wear out , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> is prepared to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafales</ENAMEX> to replace them .
     But unofficially , senior navy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> sharply criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafale</ENAMEX> as an air force <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> ill-suited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carrier</ENAMEX> use .
     Although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-18</ENAMEX> on operational grounds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Dassault</ENAMEX> .
     Although government-controlled , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Dassault</ENAMEX> still is run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serge Dassault</ENAMEX> , who has fiercely protected his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> 's independence .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Rafale</ENAMEX> project is the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's inability jointly to develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> question whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> can continue paying for expensive independent programs .
     So far , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dassault</ENAMEX> has resisted pressure to change .
     What brought the naval issue to a head is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusader</ENAMEX> squadron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , said that the last other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> , retired its last ones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusader</ENAMEX> crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> heightened pressure for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> here .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Dassault</ENAMEX> 's proposal to renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> , saying the cost was impossible to estimate .
     Even modernized , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carriers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> has sent to meet such crises as the wars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Pierre Chevenement</ENAMEX> told a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Anglo-American Press Association</ENAMEX> that the question of modernizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Crusaders</ENAMEX> or buying used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F18s</ENAMEX> is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .

     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX> , the smooth ride may be ending .

     Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead .
     Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> remains clouded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's turmoil since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> .

     `` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Eddington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay </ENAMEX>'s commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Hall</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd.</ENAMEX> , says there is n't much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> can do about rising costs for jet <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">fuel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar .
     These factors are further complicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's push to transform itself from a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> to an international one , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> says .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's profit to grow <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 13 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and next .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , it earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.82 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 361.5 million</NUMEX> -RRB- on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 11.79 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> is taking several steps to bolster business .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> step is to beef up its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> .
     In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> an order for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">A330-300s</ENAMEX> .
     The expansion , which could cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as US$ 5.7 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next eight years</TIMEX> , will expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of last year</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     The fuel-efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> will be used largely to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Tristars</ENAMEX> for regional flights , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> will be used on long-haul routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
     Fierce bidding for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is pushing up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's labor costs by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> a year for low-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , while experienced , skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> as part of the brain drain .
     Some jobs already have been moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> , and there are plans to place others in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bell</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> is working to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
     Although the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> have hurt its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> flights , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay </ENAMEX>'s other routes have retained high load factors .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> regards promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as an important part of attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , where the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> looking to travel abroad has surged .
     There also has been speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> will be among the major private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's plans to build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> possibly investing in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">terminal</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> decline to comment on the speculation .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> sees alliances with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> -- particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's recent link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> -- as an important part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay </ENAMEX>'s strategy .
     But he emphasizes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> with which it has cooperated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about a decade</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> is approached for such swaps by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> .
     `` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> says .
     `` But we 'd rather put funds into our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> rather than someone else 's .
     I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . ''
     In a pattern it aims to copy in several key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> destinations , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> recently announced plans to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> by flying into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">hub</ENAMEX> and routing continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> onto a flight on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 'll never have a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> says .
     `` But this way , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American</ENAMEX> will coordinate good extensions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> .
     We 'll coordinate on this end to places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bangkok</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> traffic , which currently accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> 's business , is expected to continue as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's mainstay .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> has long stated its desire to double its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> .
     Further expansion into southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> is also possible , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     While a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have reincorporated offshore ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> , such a move is n't an option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> because it would jeopardize its landing rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> emphatically rules out a move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> : `` Our lifeblood is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> traffic rights . ''
     He says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> is putting its faith in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> , which include the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dragon Airlines</ENAMEX> , will continue to be negotiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> fret that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">post-1997</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> ultimately will be responsible to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
     `` My feeling is -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> does n't -RCB- have a hope in the long run , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , who declines to be identified .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> acknowledges that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
     `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by , headphones jauntily in place , weaving their way along a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> of fractured and fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> .
     At a nearby corner , they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , oblivious to any danger .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away .
     -- A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who has been out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> shows up at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Marina Middle School</ENAMEX> to learn that her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> is on the condemned list .
     She is told she ca n't enter unless she is accompanied by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> .
     She bursts into tears and walks away .
     Nearby , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the school <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">shelter</ENAMEX> sit on stools , having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuses</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> offered a very <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">San Franciscan</ENAMEX> response to the disaster .
     In addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone calls and a free shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> to a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">club</ENAMEX> , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cafeteria</ENAMEX> offered donated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">croissants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">brie</ENAMEX> for breakfast , and for dinner , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pasta salad</ENAMEX> and chocolate mousse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">torts</ENAMEX> along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">salmon</ENAMEX> .
     `` This has been a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">15-pound</NUMEX> earthquake for me , '' said resident <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan O'Shea</ENAMEX> , who works in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acupuncturist</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     She and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are considering offering earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> free yoga classes and `` aroma therapy '' -- massages with scented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oils</ENAMEX> .
     She finds the response of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> -- primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> and elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> -- to the devastation of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> `` incredible .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have been very respectful of each other .
     I do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else . ''
     Out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of badly damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> were allowed a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX> scavenger hunt through their possessions .
     `` It 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara May</ENAMEX> .
     She went <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> for personal mementos .
     In post-earthquake parlance , her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> is a `` red . ''
     After being inspected , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> with substantial damage were color-coded .
     Green allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last entry to gather everything they could within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yellows</ENAMEX> went about their business with a kind of measured grimness .
     Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows .
     It did n't help that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> , after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three days</TIMEX> of sunshine , it rained .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal computers , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Fitzgerald </ENAMEX>, who helped others empty their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> wanted photo albums , a certain brooch , kind of sentimental things . ''
     He showed an unbroken , still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> .
     It belonged to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> defied orders and returned to `` red '' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> to retrieve goods .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> was upgraded to red status while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were taking things out , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> , telling her to keep sending things down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobby</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policewoman</ENAMEX> had to be called in to make her leave ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policewoman</ENAMEX> helped carry out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last load .
     Enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> trying to remove his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> was told by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to get out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garage</ENAMEX> .
     When he sneaked back later to try again , a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> offered to help him get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> also has become the focal point of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> efforts to reunite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> with any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake .
     On lampposts along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fillmore Street</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">artery</ENAMEX> , posters were offering a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> reward for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> lost during the quake .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</ENAMEX> also has been providing medical care , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> and foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> for quake-displaced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">SPCA</ENAMEX> says it has received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> requests for foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> , though some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have sought temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> .
     For example , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> parakeet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> returning home found that her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> , like many others in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> , did n't have heat .
     `` She can stay there with no heat , but for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeet</ENAMEX> , that can be deadly , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daralee Konowitch</ENAMEX> , animalcare services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">manager</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">SPCA</ENAMEX> .

     The neighborhood around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alexander Haagen Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Watts</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit .
     But turn into the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> 's parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lot</ENAMEX> , and one could be in the safe , busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mall</ENAMEX> of a prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suburb</ENAMEX> .
     Only it is safer , and busier .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> there have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> burglary , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> thefts of or from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> , no purse-snatchings , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> attempted robbery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mall</ENAMEX> , which opened in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     A shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> of similar size in an affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suburb</ENAMEX> would , per year , be expected to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> burglaries , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> thefts of or from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> robberies .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Watts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mall</ENAMEX> has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 350</NUMEX> per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haagen</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Watts</ENAMEX> area are doing almost as well .
     A successful low-crime <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mall</ENAMEX> in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability .
     Major regional and national chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> are replaced by mom-and-pop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
     Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> used to provide to community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     Thus there is even more to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson Center</ENAMEX> than a good place to shop .
     This defensible commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">zone</ENAMEX> becomes , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> , a secure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">oasis</ENAMEX> in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> are not invincible .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> improves the community image to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment .
     An additional benefit is the creation of jobs .
     This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     It continues through the life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson Center</ENAMEX> has created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> permanent private-sector jobs at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time cost in public funds of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 2,500</NUMEX> per job .
     As many of these jobs are filled by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,500</NUMEX>-per-job public investment should repay itself in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> .
     And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like .
     Profits are also plowed back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> ; the non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp.</ENAMEX> receives <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of the profits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson Center</ENAMEX> and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> -- now running into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">units</ENAMEX> -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford Crowe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Economic Development Office</ENAMEX> , says : `` There is no question that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson</ENAMEX> had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood .
     What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> and shoe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson</ENAMEX> yields . ''
     Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietors</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> are minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Grand Boulevard Plaza</ENAMEX> developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matanky Realty Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Third Ward</ENAMEX> , opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Robert Taylor Homes</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> to date have been leased to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of other minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> will have worthier role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> than the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kingpins</ENAMEX> .
     So what 's the catch ?
     Primarily that putting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> possess .
     Security costs are also quite high .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> can involve years of negotiating with numerous public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> , local political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , and citizen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , and with prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of financing .
     Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them .
     Security at a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haagen</ENAMEX> inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> is impressive , but unobtrusive .
     The entire site is enclosed by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">6-to-8-foot</NUMEX>-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Shrubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance .
     Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> ; lighting levels are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</NUMEX> times the industry standard .
     The security command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">post</ENAMEX> , camouflaged as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-story retail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">space</ENAMEX> , has its own `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">nest</ENAMEX> '' above the roofs of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , with a panoramic view of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> .
     Local law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">enforcement</ENAMEX> is present in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">sub-station</ENAMEX> occupying space donated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> .
     These features are also used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matanky Realty Group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Grand Boulevard Plaza</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haagen</ENAMEX> has its own large security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of well-trained and well-paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on round-the-clock duty at each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> .
     Security is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 % to 70 %</NUMEX> of the common area charges of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> , vs. an industry average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> .
     These security costs are kept off-budget because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax-free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing .
     Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
     However , since these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> from enacting legislation with similar provisions .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> .
     These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it .
     Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
     With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> , inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment .
     New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets .
     If the risks and rewards are reasonable , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> will respond .
     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Vermont-Slauson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Grand Boulevard Plaza</ENAMEX> and decide for themselves .
     The answer will be obvious .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Justice</ENAMEX> .

     If growth regains its glamour among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , a sluggish segment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market could show some flash .
     Some stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickers</ENAMEX> already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks .
     Best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , are languishing at depressed prices .
     Growth stocks will return to favor , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements .
     Against such a backdrop , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with proven track records of earnings gains of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> or so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> have extra appeal .
     `` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Farrell </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     Among her OTC picks are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oshkosh B'Gosh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A&W Brands</ENAMEX> .
     Like many OTC growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million</NUMEX> .
     Some like to specialize in growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> whose shares have n't traded publicly very long .
     These are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , though they also have expanding-profit track records .
     While many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum .
     That 's an important distinction because some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks .
     `` You can find some good , quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> over the counter , '' but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should be selective , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Palicka</ENAMEX> , chief portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midco Investors</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , money management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 900 million</NUMEX> invested in growth stocks of varying sizes .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palicka</ENAMEX> 's picks from the OTC market include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mail Boxes Etc.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Payco American</ENAMEX> .
     The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy .
     `` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Keith Mullins</ENAMEX> , a growth-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> .
     Eventually , he believes , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will be willing to pay higher prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with proven track records of earnings growth .
     In anticipation of that shift , he and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are encouraging their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> to buy such issues now .
     Understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently .
     The average issue on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock Index gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> says .
     Smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 15 % and 20 %</NUMEX> .
     In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     Also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> and the S&P 500 has grown <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> .
     The Nasdaq Composite has gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> this year , but that 's largely due to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> .
     Among his favorites in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's index are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Novell</ENAMEX> .
     However , more money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are reassured that profit is regaining importance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Schoeppner</ENAMEX> , portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quaker Capital Management</ENAMEX> , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can support . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barney Hallingby</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' buying decisions .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St. Jude Medical</ENAMEX> to the list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> stocks it strongly recommends .
     The opinion is largely based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's earnings momentum , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hallingby</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St. Jude</ENAMEX> 's market value on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> , so it is n't a small stock .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Kruger</ENAMEX> , who follows the stock for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> , anticipates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's net income will grow <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.15</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> took a huge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> provision for loan losses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     It charged off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 200 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> loans , leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> with a reserve for future losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 255 million</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 61 %</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">its $ 416 million</NUMEX> of troubled loans and repossessed real estate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> made the move under pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> .
     The action capped a spurt of grim <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> banking news for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , and emphatically signaled that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> is challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's largest locally owned banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , reported a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 72.2 million</NUMEX> loss and suspended its dividend .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinnacle West Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , which has been wrangling with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">months</TIMEX> over what to do about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinnacle</ENAMEX> 's moribund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merabank</ENAMEX> thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , suspended its dividend and reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</NUMEX> plunge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> credit losses surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 109 million</NUMEX> , mainly because of sour <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> real-estate loans .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> took an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 85 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX>-related charge .
     Furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> 's loss suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> have concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> losses and are forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> to do something about it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Examiners</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</ENAMEX> had been combing through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> 's real-estate portfolio since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> ; they first recommended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> take a provision that was less than the eventual <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> hit .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> balked , arguing that the figure was too high , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> responded by raising their recommendation to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> .
     `` At that point , -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> -RCB- decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> close to the talks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas P. Marrie </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations .
     He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . ''
     The tough regulatory stance portends large future losses , especially at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least six</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> savings and loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> have either been taken over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Savings & Loan Association </ENAMEX>, which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a negative $ 357.4 million</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> .
     It had a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 258.9 million</NUMEX> loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Yet it still held <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 916.3 million</NUMEX> of repossessed real estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever .
     It also had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 479.7 million</NUMEX> of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small .
     The rapid deterioration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 166 billion</NUMEX> .
     Together , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> government-controlled or essentially insolvent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> have tangible capital of a negative <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> , foreclosed property of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> and pastdue loans of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.63 billion</NUMEX> .
     They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are moving to set up .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> had a combined loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 487.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> have been recovering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 50 cents to 60 cents</NUMEX> on the dollar on foreclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> property , if they can sell it at all .
     All this havoc is the result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the worst busts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980s</TIMEX> banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> poured money into office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">condominiums</ENAMEX> and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> would grow at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % to 6 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> to come .
     Now , annual population growth is running at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</NUMEX> a year , some desert tracts bought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90,000</NUMEX> an acre are being sold at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25,000</NUMEX> an acre and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-year</TIMEX> supply of unoccupied office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">space</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> -- it might have knocked out some of our empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.W. Jackson</ENAMEX> , a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> think the worst may be yet to come .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Shattuck </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foreclosure Update</ENAMEX> newsletter , said foreclosures have climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,482</NUMEX> a month just in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Maricopa County</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> is located .
     That 's up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 687</NUMEX> a month in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , and it 's accelerating : So far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , foreclosures are averaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 85</NUMEX> a day .
     `` It 's frightening , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shattuck</ENAMEX> said .
     Moreover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shattuck</ENAMEX> and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures .
     And the generally frail condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> means there is little capital available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> to shore up the economy and slow down the slide .
     `` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&L</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson </ENAMEX>.
     `` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between now and year-end</TIMEX> ... .
     The only thing a lot of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> can get out of their mouth now is : ` Pay me in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">60 days</TIMEX> . ' ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 214.4 million</NUMEX> loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 's third quarter</TIMEX> , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> operations .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the six months ended June 30</TIMEX> , it reported net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 234.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.83</NUMEX> a share , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46 million</NUMEX> from tax credits and accounting changes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6 billion</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion</NUMEX> of assets .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marrie</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> real-estate prices , which plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last year</TIMEX> , to fall another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> before stabilizing .
     Some in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> think that may be optimistic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> `` achieved results as expected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , '' but did n't specify the results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate</ENAMEX> stock closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.625</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> , in composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Since its unsuccessful bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marrie</ENAMEX> said the problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> have only `` increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective . ''
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> lowered its ratings on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National Corp.</ENAMEX> 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus , affecting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 million</NUMEX> of long-term debt .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&P</ENAMEX> also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National Bank of Arizona</ENAMEX> .
     The ratings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> said the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's financial condition .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> will be able to withstand the current downturn in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> real estate .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Immunex Corp.</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> .
     The molecule is the mouse version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">interleukin-4 receptor</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">IL-4</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">hormone</ENAMEX> which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> 's immune response .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">IL-4 receptor</ENAMEX> on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> 's defense .
     But in certain conditions such as autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> and transplant rejection , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
     A soluble form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">receptor</ENAMEX> might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">IL-4 receptor</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">receptors</ENAMEX> to be developed and tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Receptech Corp.</ENAMEX> , a spinoff of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> , through a proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> initial public offering .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> will contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">spinoff</ENAMEX> to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">agents</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> will have the option to buy back <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Receptech</ENAMEX> shares after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers .
     It said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its third quarter</TIMEX> soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 cents</NUMEX> a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .
     Its revenue totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 184.4 million</NUMEX> , an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">172 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 67.8 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers , the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment .
     Since its inception , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five to 10</NUMEX> times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines .

     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are likely to keep close on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> 's heels .
     `` They are going to catch up , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Claridge</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> already produce hard-disk drives , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also is studying the field , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claridge</ENAMEX> said .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> is n't standing still .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> introduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> products , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks .
     Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> drives uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">a mere 1.5 watts</NUMEX> of power and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">just 5.5 ounces</NUMEX> .
     `` Most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> are announcing products based on our -LRB- older -RRB- products , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finis Conner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that bears his name .
     `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
     These new products could account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 35 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's business in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> estimated .
     `` We 're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> already is shipping its new drives .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only six pounds</NUMEX> and fits in a briefcase .
     From its inception , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagate</ENAMEX> .
     The availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand for laptop computers , whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> , which as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> owned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     Sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner 's</ENAMEX> business in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 %</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .

     Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900</ENAMEX> '' number has been launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telelawyer</ENAMEX> , using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communication Corp.</ENAMEX> 's toll-tele-phone service .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cane & Associates</ENAMEX> touts its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX>-a-minute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the `` cheapest legal hour</TIMEX> you 'll ever find . ''
     Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> is available only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , Telelawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Cane</ENAMEX> says he plans to franchise it in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     He says his aim is to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to take their case or simply ca n't afford <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' consultation fees .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cane</ENAMEX> stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to his doorstep .
     `` We will only deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> on the phone , '' he says .
     `` We have no in-office business . ''
     Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit .
     Local bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">associations</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law .
     There also are `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800</ENAMEX> '' hotlines which refer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , usually personal-injury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , for in-office consultation .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> reaches Telelawyer by dialing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">900-TELELAW</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receptionist</ENAMEX> refers the call to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> .
     In an effort to determine whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> has reason to sue , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> and several support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> .
     There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone .
     If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cane</ENAMEX> says , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> may refer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> to a law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     But he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cane & Associates</ENAMEX> does n't receive referral fees .
     So far , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cane</ENAMEX> , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> calls a day , and the average call lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 minutes</TIMEX> .
     Out of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> charge , the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> pockets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.55</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> , interest-free loan from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South Bronx</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcias</ENAMEX> were cleared of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities .

     In addition , he says , publishing the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation .
     Nevertheless , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lupel</ENAMEX> anticipates no legal action to reverse the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Illinois Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's decision to institute the changes .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Rich Greene Inc.</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1966</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> said that the tobacco and food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said another potential contender is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , which works on some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> products .

     Also mentioned as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contender</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TBWA Advertising</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> denied it was participating .
     The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     The account billed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 60 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Leading National Advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> has scaled back ad spending on the brand over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said , and it now bills <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 30 million to $ 40 million</NUMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> had asked the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maxwell</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wheat First Securities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Richmond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> has slipped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> of the cigarette market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 4.1 %</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter of this year</TIMEX> .
     The brand is No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> overall in the cigarette business , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said .
     The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> picturing a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch .
     That ad generated so much publicity that a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> launched a contest for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to guess who the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was and what he was doing .

     This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> is girding for gridlock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> avoid travel routes ravaged by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake .
     Estimates of damage in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-county <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area neared <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">artery</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from the east , will be closed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least several weeks</TIMEX> .
     Part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> collapsed in the quake , which registered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> on the Richter scale .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> normally carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> a day .
     Also , most of the ramps connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> to its main link to the south , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">101</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> , have been closed for repairs .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> system , which runs subway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trains</ENAMEX> beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BART</ENAMEX> has increased service to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> a day in preparation for the onslaught .
     Most unusual will be water-borne <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">East Bay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">32 years</TIMEX> , ferry service has been restored between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">East Bay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Red and White Fleet</ENAMEX> , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Marin County</ENAMEX> , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">East Bay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> a chance to ride the waves for the price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> round-trip .
     That tariff is too stiff for some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Financial District</ENAMEX> wage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">earners</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'll stay with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BART</ENAMEX> , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> to be swamped with an extra load of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">East Bay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> making a long detour .
     `` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 23,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> typically travel over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">commute hours</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 130,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> cross during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> period .
     Meetings canceled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> raised the specter of empty hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> .
     It also raised hackles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boosters</ENAMEX> .
     `` Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> are calling -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Shafer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX> .
     City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stuck by their estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> in damage to the quake-shocked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">counties</ENAMEX> have increased their total damage estimates to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     All estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> .
     Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage .
     The most worrisome stretch is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">1.2 miles</NUMEX> of waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Embarcadero Freeway</ENAMEX> .
     Until it was closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , it had provided the quickest series of exits for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> heading into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Financial District</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Engineers</ENAMEX> say it will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least eight months</TIMEX> to repair the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Embarcadero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> .
     As part of the quake recovery effort , the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Building Department</ENAMEX> has surveyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , including all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Financial District</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">high-rises</ENAMEX> .
     The preliminary conclusion from a survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">high-rises</ENAMEX> is that `` we were incredibly lucky , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kornfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's chief building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> .
     While many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage .
     City building codes require construction that can resist temblors .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">England</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Leach</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's of London</ENAMEX> , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster .
     `` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leach</ENAMEX> said .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , during a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> to survey quake damage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> promised to `` meet the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> plan to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> reserve , and is expected to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> to that fund in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year</TIMEX> .
     Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief .
     However , state initiatives restrict the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> to raise such taxes unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> approve in a statewide referendum .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> posted a loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">980.2 million Australian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 762.4 million</NUMEX> -RRB- , the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> corporate history .
     That loss compared with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 273.5 million</NUMEX> .
     In preliminary , unaudited results reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> also posted an operating loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 814.1 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended June 30</TIMEX> , compared with operating profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 354.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Operating revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 8.48 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 5.01 billion</NUMEX> .
     But the net interest bill jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 686.7 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 371.1 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property .
     Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> 's assets and those of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     The results included a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 453.4 million</NUMEX> write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 149.5 million</NUMEX> on the sale of a stake of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lonrho PLC .</ENAMEX>
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later .
     Earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 123.8 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 247.3 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the general financial performance of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> brewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> , was `` disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> 's shares closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> before news of the results at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28 Australian cents</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one Australian cent</NUMEX> .
     The staggering losses cap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a tumultuous year</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">flagship</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only a year ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> , who controls <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 58 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> has agreed to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> brewing assets .
     It has sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> of other assets and has more on the block .
     But in a TV interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> said , `` We 've taken a big loss .
     We 've taken it on the chin .
     But we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     It said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios .
     The result `` will ultimately be a very different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> in size and structure , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> said in a statement .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">auditors</ENAMEX> cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 Australian cents</NUMEX> a share , vs. positive asset backing of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A$ 1.92</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Still , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> confirm absolutely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is solvent . ''
     Indeed , in a note to the results , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> said if the `` true worth '' of some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one .
