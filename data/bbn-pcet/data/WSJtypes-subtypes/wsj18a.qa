     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.4 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Postal Service</ENAMEX> bill providing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 billion</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> and increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Customs Service</ENAMEX> 's air-interdiction program nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> .
     Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , and the swift passage contrasted with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> .
     An estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</NUMEX> was added for university and science grants , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Smith College</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Southwest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> were a driving force behind <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54.6 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> , or more than double the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's request .
     More than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 million</NUMEX> is allocated for pensions and expenses for former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> , and the budget for the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> is more than doubled , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> designated for improvements to the property .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> is remembered with an extra <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> to help offset pay costs that other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> are being asked to absorb .
     Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> , nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.95 billion</NUMEX> is provided for processing tax returns , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> increase over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> and double what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> was spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years ago</TIMEX> .
     Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> specifically added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.4 million</NUMEX> for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .
     The large increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Customs Service</ENAMEX> air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> appropriations level has more than quadrupled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 196.7 million</NUMEX> provided for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> anticipates the purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">P-3</ENAMEX> surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Citation II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jets</ENAMEX> .
     Despite administration reservations , the plan has had the quiet backing of customs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> as well as influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> 's home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> .
     Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> expenditure for enforcement of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans .
     Small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> tax rules .
     Repeal is considered likely now , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim .
     Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HEI Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> to retroactively `` move '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hospital</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> to the next to justify higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> reimbursements .
     The provision seeks to wipe out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 1.4 million</NUMEX> in claims made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health Care Finance Administration</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HEI </ENAMEX>, which owned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sullivan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo.</ENAMEX> , during most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the four-year period</TIMEX> -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1983-1987</TIMEX> -- covered in the amendment .
     In a separate development , a private meeting is scheduled <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Miss .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- in an effort to end a dispute which for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> has delayed action on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 44 billion</NUMEX> agriculture bill .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference reached agreement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 5</TIMEX> on virtually all major provisions of the bill , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> over the fate of a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>-based program to provide technical information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fertilizers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> .
     The program 's nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsors</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">79-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mississippian</ENAMEX> takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> border .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan -- including the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> -- in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets , company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13.35 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.03 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- takeover bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> , intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to clear the way for its value-boosting measures .
     If anything , the gyrations in world stock markets -- and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> 's share price -- since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and several big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holders</ENAMEX> said .
     `` Thank God we have some deal on the table , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart Gilchrist</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish Amicable Investment Managers</ENAMEX> , which intends to vote its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 1 %</NUMEX> stake in favor of the restructuring .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> have been on a roller coaster .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's best-performing blue chip over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past six months</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> against a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> has been hit harder than other big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> stocks -- first by the market gyrations , then by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake , which could leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> facing big claims .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight cents</NUMEX> -RRB- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">756 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.91</NUMEX> -RRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> as a late market rally erased a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28-pence</NUMEX> fall earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     To fight off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">predators</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> plans to spin off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6 billion</NUMEX> in assets , largely by selling such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks</ENAMEX> and by floating its big paper and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> via share issues to existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> .
     Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of its shares and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> dividend increase .
     `` I think the restructuring will get the required support , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Pacitti</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> stockbroker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UBS Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> 's restructuring , which was never going to happen quickly , now will take longer because of the market upheaval .
     Company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next year 's first half</TIMEX> now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half</TIMEX> .
     `` We are n't forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> .
     We do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time , '' to take particular steps , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Prideaux</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> receives approval for the restructuring , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will remain in play , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , though the situation may unfold over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next 12 months</TIMEX> , rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hybrid</ENAMEX> whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> believe .
     Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> 's restructuring may only make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> a more manageable target for other corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">predators</ENAMEX> -- possibly such acquisitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hanson PLC</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last few days</TIMEX> will surely slow down the pace of events , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish Amicable</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilchrist</ENAMEX> .
     `` But I would n't write off '' Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> or other potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> .
     Among possible delays , the sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> -- which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas season</TIMEX> -- may slide into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second half</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> estimate that sales of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> could raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> is n't predicting a postponement because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> `` are quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prideaux</ENAMEX> .
     But the delay could happen if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> does n't get adequate bids , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> say possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">acquirers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> from both retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Cinema Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is interested in bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks</ENAMEX> .
     Other potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">May Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Limited Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> has declined to identify the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> .
     Though Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> has said he intends to mount a new bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> once approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">regulators</ENAMEX> is received , jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> leverage buy-outs are making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> more skeptical about Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> 's prospects .
     His initial offer indicated he needed to raise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 80 %</NUMEX> of the takeover financing through the debt markets .
     Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> 's attracting a premium price for its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing properties .
     Finally , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake initially knocked <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7 %</NUMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> 's share price in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> because of fears of the potential claims to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Farmers</ENAMEX> , which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Farmers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prideaux</ENAMEX> said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims .
     He added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> `` has no expectation of a material impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Farmers</ENAMEX> .

     Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> to come .
     But rail , air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake with only minor damage , and many are expected to be operating normally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , government and corporate transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     Air traffic at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">San Francisco International Airport</ENAMEX> was running <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> of normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , but airport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officals</ENAMEX> said they expect a return to full operations by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said that although none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">terminals</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> were damaged in the quake , road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-hour to five-hour</TIMEX> traffic delays on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">San Mateo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> , for example .
     In addition , power failures prevented its package-sorting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> from operating , causing delays .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> 's rail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> said that except for damage to shipping containers in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">yard</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">track</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structures</ENAMEX> were unharmed .
     That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">railroad</ENAMEX> is operating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trains</ENAMEX> but with delays caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> unable to get to work .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ENAMEX> , the hardest hit of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">railroads</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> , said service on its north-south coastline , which is used by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> , was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake .
     But service on the line is expected to resume by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     `` We had no serious damage on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">railroad</ENAMEX> , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southern Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are shut down . ''

     The passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">railroad</ENAMEX> said it terminated some runs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , relying on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">buses</ENAMEX> to ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> said it planned to resume some train operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Rail-transit operations suffered little damage , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Engelken</ENAMEX> , deputy executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Public Transit Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> `` withstood the earthquake perfectly , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trains</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> to provide an alternative for highway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> .
     `` The highway system is screwed up '' by the earthquake , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The transit system is how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are going to be getting around . ''
     He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's trolley <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and trolley <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">buses</ENAMEX> were also running at full service levels .
     Although air-traffic delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were significant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , they did n't appear to spread to other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> .
     The earthquake shattered windows at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">San Francisco International</ENAMEX> 's air-traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">tower</ENAMEX> and rained pieces of the ceiling down on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of whom suffered minor injuries .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">Terminals</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">San Francisco International</ENAMEX> also were damaged , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">tower</ENAMEX> itself was intact .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">Runways</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were n't damaged , but traffic was being limited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> arrivals and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> departures an hour -- down from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">tower</ENAMEX> was overwhelming without the windows , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> was closed , flights were diverted to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Reno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev.</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> gates were unusable , mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said none of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were injured at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> ; in fact , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> was being evacuated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> were born .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> were both fully operational by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said .
     In terms of diversions , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Stapleton International</ENAMEX> may have experienced the most far-flung : A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Japan</ENAMEX> was rerouted there .
     `` I think that 's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> nonstop commercial passenger flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Japan</ENAMEX> to land here , '' an airport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said its flights into and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were n't affected , but getting information about its operations was difficult .
     Its telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Burlingame</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , had been knocked out since the quake .

     Now , it wants to concentrate on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> and its newer hotel and restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     For rival liquor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whitbread</ENAMEX> auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> is planning a big coming-out party on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> for its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> line of mainframe computers .
     But an uninvited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">guest</ENAMEX> is expected to try to crash the party .
     On the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> of the long-planned announcement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> is to introduce its own new mainframe .
     `` Their attitude is , ` You want to talk mainframes , we 'll talk mainframes , ' '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> computer industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     `` They 're deliberately trying to steal our thunder , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> complains .
     `` Maybe we should take it as a compliment . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's target is the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion</NUMEX> market for mainframe computers , the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> needs to run its business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , has dominated the market for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> .
     That does n't scare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> , which has grown to be the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> by poaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's mid-range machines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes , and it has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 1 billion</NUMEX> developing the new technology .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">spoiler</ENAMEX> , nimble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem Computers Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cupertino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , jumped into the fray <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> with an aggressively priced entry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> appears more worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> , which has a broad base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> waiting for the new line , dubbed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX 9000</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's going to be nuclear war , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Willmott</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aberdeen Group Inc</ENAMEX> .
     The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market , where growth has slowed to single digits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's traditional mainframe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR Corp.</ENAMEX> , have struggled recently .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is promising a new approach .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Glorioso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for high performance systems , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices .
     And unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's water-cooled mainframes , it does n't need any plumbing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">challengers</ENAMEX> will have a big price advantage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is expected to tag its new line from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.24 million to $ 4.4 million</NUMEX> and up , depending on configuration .
     That 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the price of comparably equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> 's pricing is just as aggressive .
     The heightened competition will hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> at a difficult time .
     The computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> 's current mainframe line , which has sold well and has huge profit margins , is starting to show its age .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">3090s</ENAMEX> due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> will boost performance by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 8 % to 10 %</NUMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     Still , no one expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> to deliver a knockout .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has a near-monopoly on mainframes , with an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> share of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital </ENAMEX>-- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem </ENAMEX>-- and wields enormous market power .
     It counts among its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> a majority of the world 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , which entrust their most critical business information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> computers .
     `` We 're not going to walk in and replace a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframe , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth H. Olsen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing , which includes retail-sales tracking , airline reservations and bank-teller networks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> , which already specializes in on-line transaction processing , is a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> in that market .
     A key marketing target for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will be the large number of big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> who already own both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> systems .
     One such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust Co .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Rose</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , technological and strategic planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust </ENAMEX>, says that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's low prices , `` we are n't about to unplug our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> machine .
     The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> is still looking seriously at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">9000</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX</ENAMEX> to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts , juggling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of billions of dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each day</TIMEX> , he says .
     As that system grows , larger computers may be needed .
     `` In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> had to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> when they outgrew the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX</ENAMEX> .
     Now they do n't have to , '' he says .
     `` That 's going to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> revenue . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> can expect this pent-up demand for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX</ENAMEX> to fuel strong sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry F. Willman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</ENAMEX> , estimates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">9000</ENAMEX> could boost sales by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     He bases the estimate on a survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will announce a full family of mainframes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> , it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> model available will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">210</ENAMEX> , which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> interested in the optional super-charger , or vector processor , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Shannon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Data Corp.</ENAMEX> , a market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> more models , aimed squarely at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , are expected to begin shipping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late June</TIMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first quarter</TIMEX> , which begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next July 1</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's new line has been a long time coming .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product , and made a costly decision in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in revenue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willman</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will face still more competition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amdahl Corp.</ENAMEX> , backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> , has a growing share of the market with its low-priced , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX>-compatible machines .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Advanced Systems</ENAMEX> , a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Electronic Data Systems</ENAMEX> , is expected to unveil a line of powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX>-compatible mainframes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year</TIMEX> .

     The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off , but the dollar slumped .
     Stocks rose slightly as trading activity slowed from the frenzied pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> .
     Prices of long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds hovered in a narrow band most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> , finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon .
     Helped by futures-related program buying , the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.92</NUMEX> points to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2643.65</NUMEX> .
     But the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX>-consecutive session as more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> dumped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares .
     Bond prices rallied early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> scrambled to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues on fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle .
     But when stocks held steady , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds later retreated .
     Speculation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> will lower interest rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming weeks</TIMEX> helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> remain wary about stocks , partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers .
     `` I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility '' in stocks , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.</ENAMEX> , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legg Mason Wood Walker</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have issued junk bonds .
     In a bull market , credit does not matter , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeVoe</ENAMEX> added .
     `` But when it does matter , then it 's the only thing that matters . ''
     However , many institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as `` a great buying opportunity , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles I. Clough</ENAMEX> , chief investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
     `` Things are beginning to settle down .
     The markets are returning to normalcy . ''
     Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> would disrupt production .
     But prices <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> reversed course , finishing slightly lower , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> would quickly pick up the slack .
     In major market activity :
     Stock prices rose .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume shrank to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166.9 million</NUMEX> shares from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">224.1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     Advancers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> outpaced decliners by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">822</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">668</NUMEX> .
     Bond prices were little changed in sluggish activity .
     The yield on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> issue fell slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.03 %</NUMEX> .
     The dollar dropped .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> , the currency was at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8485 marks</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.75 yen</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8667 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> 's earnings decline comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> after the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> and the rest of the airline industry set profit records .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a spectacular second half of 1988</TIMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> 's stumble does n't bode well for the rest of the industry .

     Without federal subsidies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> of beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> , the economic and structural damage by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> would have been much less , as highlighted by your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 3</TIMEX> editorial `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Subsidizing Disaster</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">communities</ENAMEX> on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such as the hard-hit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Isle of Palms</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charleston</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31.9 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , were living in poverty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's figure was down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.4 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> decline in the poverty rate , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> drop was n't statistically significant .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> 's report also showed that while some measures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's economic well-being improved modestly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year before</TIMEX> .
     Summarizing data derived from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1989</TIMEX> survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Butz</ENAMEX> , associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> , said that `` most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> either stayed the same or improved . ''
     But , he added , `` Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> , the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal .
     There was no reversal -LCB- of that trend -RCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">between 1987 and 1988</TIMEX> . ''
     Per capita income , a widely used measure of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's economic health , hit a record in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> after inflation adjustment to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13,120</NUMEX> .
     But the median income of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time it has failed to rise since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butz</ENAMEX> said the divergence in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures reflects changes in family size and structure , including the rising number of female-headed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and a sharp increase in income reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who are n't living in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     As a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's decline , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's estimate for the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living below the poverty line declined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500,000</NUMEX> .
     The poverty threshold , defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times food expenses as calculated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agricultural Department</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12,092</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> counts all cash income in determining whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are below the line , but it does n't consider other government benefits , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> .
     Thanks largely to the continued growth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy , the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> peak of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.3 %</NUMEX> , but the improvements have been modest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX> .
     Poverty remains far more widespread among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.6 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> lived in poverty , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.1 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.8 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of all poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were white .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> living without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than three-fourths</NUMEX> of poor black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     The poverty rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under 18 years old</TIMEX> dropped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.7 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , but remained far higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX> .
     The rate among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> -- was n't significantly lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year before</TIMEX> .
     If it were n't for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> payments , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> would be below the poverty line , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butz</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> also said :
     -- Some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.2 %</NUMEX> of all money income received by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> went to the wealthiest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     That is the greatest share reported for any year since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1950</TIMEX> , although changing definitions over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> distort the comparison .
     -- The top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> of the income , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade earlier</TIMEX> .
     The bottom <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> of the income , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade earlier</TIMEX> .
     -- Confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation , earnings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year-round</TIMEX> , full-time male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> after adjusting for higher prices , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such drop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     Earnings of female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were unchanged .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> working full-time earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66 cents</NUMEX> for every dollar earned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> more than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven cents</NUMEX> more than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> .
     -- Median household income -- which includes both those living in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and those who are n't -- rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27,225</NUMEX> after inflation .
     It rose sharply in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and fell slightly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> .
     Median family income was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32,191</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> .
     -- Per capita income of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> , though still <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 60 %</NUMEX> that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , while per capita income of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.5 %</NUMEX> .
     -- Among married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> , the gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> narrowed sharply , as income of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> shot up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.8 %</NUMEX> while income of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> did n't budge .
     Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1983</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> said some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5 million</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would have fallen below the poverty line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1988</TIMEX> -- and the poverty rate would have been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.5 %</NUMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1 %</NUMEX> -- under the alternative calculation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     A report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Joint Economic Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> concluded , `` It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Jupiter</ENAMEX> is so enormous -- its mass is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">318</NUMEX> times that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gases</ENAMEX> and never let them escape .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> project started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> , and a number of project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> were on hand to watch the launch .
     An ebullient Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson </ENAMEX>, wearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars , called the launch `` fantastic . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny Chin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">probe</ENAMEX> , compared it to watching a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> leave home .
     `` I 'm happy and sad , '' he said .
     Anti-nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> took a less positive view .
     Having argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> 's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , they were n't quieted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's successful launch .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> will skim past <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Jupiter</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> also could crash to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> then .
     They said they dropped plans to infiltrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> beefed up its security .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> protest did get past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> 's guard , though ; a computer virus caused anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> messages to flash onto some computer screens at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">centers</ENAMEX> .
     The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> space-science program .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally Manufacturing Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> have agreed in principle to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 million</NUMEX> settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> 's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> familiar with the settlement talks , the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than two years ago</TIMEX> was reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> and will soon be submitted to a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Camden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J .</ENAMEX>
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> by agreeing to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6 million</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> shares for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 83.7 million</NUMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 18 million</NUMEX> above market price .
     The term greenmail refers to a situation where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acquirer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement , citing a request by a federal court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX> not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who are familiar with the matter said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 million</NUMEX> payment will be shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> , with the casino and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> probably paying the bulk of the money .
     The amount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     That settlement represented the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> were granted a major payment in a greenmail case .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> made a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 59.7 million</NUMEX> profit on the sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney</ENAMEX> of his investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> probably faced much more potential liability because , when he sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney</ENAMEX> during his takeover battle , he filed on behalf of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney</ENAMEX> offered to pay Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> a premium for his shares , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> did n't demand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also pay a premium to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> , he sued only on behalf of himself .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Delaware</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> is incorporated , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule .
     That rule gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seventeen</NUMEX> articles of impeachment against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bench</ENAMEX> , were approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1988</TIMEX> .
     The central charge against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> is that he conspired with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to obtain a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150,000</NUMEX> bribe from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> in a criminal case before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , in return for leniency .
     He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> 's public gallery was packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> , who erupted into applause after he finished his argument .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings </ENAMEX>, who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bryant</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who conducted a lengthy inquiry into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> ' activities , said `` a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> will deliberate behind closed doors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> is impeached , as is thought likely , he will be removed from office immediately .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">COMPANIES</ENAMEX> SEEKING to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> pay for pollution cleanup win court victory .
     In a case involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avondale Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers Cos</ENAMEX>. , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> ruled in favor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> issues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say are central to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of pollution cases around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies .
     They also have argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> proceedings notifying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit ; thus , such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the policies , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> say .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> disagreed on both counts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avondale</ENAMEX> was notified by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Louisiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avondale</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> to defend it in the state proceeding , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> did n't respond .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> upheld a district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's ruling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> had to defend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in such proceedings .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> also said , `` We think an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims '' stemming from any cleanup .
     `` This decision will have a very considerable impact , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Abraham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of environmental law and insurance law at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Virginia</ENAMEX> , because many commercial insurance policies are issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Greaney</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chemical Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> , said that while other appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages , the influence of the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> `` will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> sit up and listen . ''
     He said the decision was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in which a federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry R. Ostrager</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers </ENAMEX>, said , `` there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further . ''

     That is the conclusion of a report released by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York State Bar Association</ENAMEX> .
     The report was based on a telephone survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,250</NUMEX> low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> , a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the field .
     `` The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Genova</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> that oversaw the survey and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Milbank , Tweed , Hadley & McCloy</ENAMEX> .

     Nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> ranked housing problems as their most serious unmet legal need .
     Other areas targeted by the survey 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> -RRB- , consumer fraud -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.4 %</NUMEX> -RRB- , and health-care issues -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> -RRB- .

     After failing to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Sears Tower</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears , Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> is negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> pension fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldrich , Eastman & Waltch Inc.</ENAMEX> to refinance the property for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 850 million</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> close to the negotiations .
     Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> would receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as a convertible mortgage .
     At the end of the term of the convertible loan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> could still own half the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AEW</ENAMEX> could own the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> .
     Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">side</ENAMEX> would comment .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> are currently negotiating over who would manage the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , which will be emptied of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> ' merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , which is moving elsewhere .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> will face the daunting task of leasing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">1.8 million square feet</NUMEX> in a relatively soft <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> real estate market .
     Also , it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AEW</ENAMEX> will be able to convert into equity .
     Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> of late .
     In a convertible mortgage , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> lends the building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity , usually <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</NUMEX> , at the end of the loan term .
     During the term , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lender</ENAMEX> can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> 's appreciation or a fixed return .
     The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> said it would put the 110-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> on the block <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">almost a year ago</TIMEX> as part of its anti-takeover restructuring .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> shied away from bidding on the high-profile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> sentiment .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> appeared to have a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     But that deal fell through in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment , raising property taxes , and making it difficult to lease the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> at competitive prices .
     Real estate industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> ' investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> , sought financing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> then went back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AEW</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">adviser</ENAMEX> that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of bids <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AEW</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 billion</NUMEX> of real estate investments nationwide , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Datatronic AB</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> for cash .
     The amount was n't disclosed .
     The electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> previously estimated the sale price at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 100 million and $ 200 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Datatronic</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Victor</ENAMEX> microcomputer and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Micronic</ENAMEX> hand-held computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> will acquire rights to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Micronic</ENAMEX> names for computers .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Datatronic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> had combined sales in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> .
     The transaction will give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> computer brand that includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributors</ENAMEX> marketing to medium-sized business and educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 10 %</NUMEX> .
     Wall Street is seething over the rules , which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs .
     The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Senate</ENAMEX> , could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> , some tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> argue .
     Indeed , some investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules .
     Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> version of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the provisions .
     At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs .
     Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value , with interest accruing instead of being paid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holder</ENAMEX> .
     Under current rules , that accrued interest is deductible by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> issuing the debt .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version of the legislation would kill that deduction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n't deductible .
     The less-rigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> version would defer the deductibility for roughly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     `` You see these in just about every LBO , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Willens</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in charge of tax issues at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` It becomes a source of cash '' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> .
     Typically , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willens</ENAMEX> estimates , this type of debt makes up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> of the financing for LBOs .
     These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kroger Co .</ENAMEX>
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> provision passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> would eliminate a rule allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the previous three years</TIMEX> .
     For example , if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> posted a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> from buy-out interest payments , the existing rule would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , when it may have been a profitable public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street , which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue .
     `` Prices for LBOs have to come down if you do n't have that feature , '' argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Schloss</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for merchant banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Several Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say the proposed legislation already is having an impact .
     An investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> recently lowered a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.35 billion</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , because of the threat of the legislation .
     Moreover , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> , who requested anonymity , said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> did n't raise the ante for a target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> after a stronger bid emerged from a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that was n't concerned about the financing provision .
     `` We would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass , '' he said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is , give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> rather than just interest payments .
     That would force the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> and the target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's management to reduce their level of ownership .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter C. Canellos</ENAMEX> , tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz</ENAMEX> .
     Another solution , said a tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who requested anonymity , is for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount .
     Since they have a lower interest rate , they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percentage points above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes , has at least a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five-year</TIMEX> maturity and does n't pay interest for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least one year</TIMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> .
     The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .
     Currently , even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> does n't pay tax , the debt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> is taxed on the accrued interest .
     But those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are often foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> estimates that its version of the provision would yield <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> and a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 409 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version would raise slightly more .
     Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult .
     `` There 's no question it will make LBOs more expensive , '' he said .
     `` The interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> signed a disaster declaration covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">counties</ENAMEX> .
     The declaration immediately made the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">counties</ENAMEX> eligible for temporary housing , grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses .
     In addition , an unusually wide array of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> moved to provide specialized assistance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> prepared to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 100</NUMEX> vacant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> available for those left homeless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> for directing traffic .
     But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's wake , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> allocated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> in relief funds , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 273 million</NUMEX> of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake .
     Now , though , enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief .
     `` That obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us , and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said .
     The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said , `` There will be , I think quite obviously , a very large amount of money required from all levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> . ''
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> already are looking for ways to add relief funds .
     Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Emergency Management Agency </ENAMEX>, which coordinates federal disaster relief .
     More likely , relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is to begin considering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> .
     But it is n't just <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's relief dollars that are spread thin ; its relief manpower also is stretched .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> still has special disaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">centers</ENAMEX> open to handle the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Clanahan</ENAMEX> acknowledged that `` we 're pretty thin . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clanahan</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history .
     To further complicate relief efforts , the privately funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Red Cross</ENAMEX> also finds itself strapped for funds after its big <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> operation .
     `` It 's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a bad month</TIMEX> money-wise and every other way , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Stewart</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> .
     `` It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> has opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">shelters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> , serving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> capable of cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> were dispatched from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> wo n't be determined until state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> make specific requests to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> , agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     And in the confusion after the earthquake , `` the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Suchocki</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     Still , some aid is moving westward from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> almost immediately .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they will make available <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> that are under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> loans but now are vacant after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> have been inspected to ensure they are sound .
     Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said , and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use .
     Another federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> not normally associated with disaster relief -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> -- moved quickly as well .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> plans to announce specific relief procedures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming days</TIMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the minimum six-month period</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Francisco Bay area</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> that provide a ready base of supplies and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     Even before the full extent of the devastation was known , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> ordered the military services to set up an emergency command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and prepare to respond to various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> requests for assistance .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> began moving additional rescue and medical supplies , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> , communications equipment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FEMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
