     What does n't belong here ?
     A. manual typewriters , B. black-and-white snapshots , C. radio adventure shows .
     If you guessed black-and-white snapshots , you 're right .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of fading into the background , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tone photography is coming back .
     Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> pitching jeans , shoes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">liquor</ENAMEX> .
     Portrait <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios</ENAMEX> accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders .
     And black-and-white photography <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white .
     And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films . `` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard DeMoulin</ENAMEX> , the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> 's professional photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> , and they are expected to jump at least that much again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> , which largely ignored the market for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , black-and-white film sales now account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 15 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> in film and paper sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> recently began marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">T-Max 3200</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films . Aimed at commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> , the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Franz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Photofinishing Newsletter</ENAMEX> .
     Also trying to snare a portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX>-a-year industry is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bayer AG</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa</ENAMEX> recently signed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympic</ENAMEX> gold medalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence Griffith-Joyner</ENAMEX> to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and will compete directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's papers . Slated for market by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     The biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">beneficiary</ENAMEX> of the black-and-white revival is likely to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , known in the industry for its premium products .
     Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> varieties of black-and-white film <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> wo n't say by exactly how much . `` We hope the trend lasts , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie DiCara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford</ENAMEX> 's marketing communications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     Why all the interest ?
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye-catching and exotic . `` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen B. Butler</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the applied photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rochester Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
     `` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds .
     Such features have been especially attractive to professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
     Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.7 million</NUMEX> rolls .
     Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gap Inc.</ENAMEX> , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and other well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> modeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> 's jeans and T-shirts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Crisman</ENAMEX> , the account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for the campaign , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gap</ENAMEX> did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     `` We wanted to highlight the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
     The campaign won a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Cleo</ENAMEX> award as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's best ad by a specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> .
     Even food products and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">automobiles</ENAMEX> , which have long depended on color , are making the switch . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> `` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc L. Hauser</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> who is working on a black-and-white print ad for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stouffer Food Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lean Cuisine</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that are currently using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tone ads include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Epson America Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Portrait <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios</ENAMEX> have also latched onto the trend . Using black and white , `` we can make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives</ENAMEX> look like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Perrin</ENAMEX> .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">On-Broadway Photography</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Portland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore.</ENAMEX> , doubled its business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and , he says , is booked solid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dayna Brunsdon</ENAMEX> , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic .
     I show it to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> , and they all say ` wow . '
     It is n't ordinary like color . ''
     Still , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are n't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big obstacle is that few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">drugstores</ENAMEX> develop the film anymore .
     Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processors</ENAMEX> and may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> or more to be processed and returned .
     Black-and-white film costs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
     But for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">photofinishers</ENAMEX> , developing costs for black-and-white film are higher .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are starting to tackle that problem .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ilford</ENAMEX> , for example , recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">labs</ENAMEX> .
     Intent on wooing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes .
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Agfa</ENAMEX> is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> , offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> is distributing an instructional video to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processors</ENAMEX> on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are introducing related products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Beseler Co.</ENAMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of photographic enlargers , introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> who want to process their own black-and-white photographs .
     The kit , which has a suggested retail price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> noticed numerous requests from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's photography equipment . `` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Brightman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beseler</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> .
     But some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
     They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints . `` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rochester Institute</ENAMEX> .
     `` The color print <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> is far superior to prints of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> .
     You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
     But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Popular Photography</ENAMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> , selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">150th</NUMEX> anniversary , all were black and white . `` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred DeBat</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Professional Photographers of America</ENAMEX> .
     `` That 's the appeal .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McClatchy Newspapers Inc.</ENAMEX> said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</NUMEX> gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> a share .

     While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
     The barometer , developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Columbia University</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Center for International Business Cycle Research</ENAMEX> here , reached a record high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223.0</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest month</TIMEX> available , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
     The latest reading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223.0</NUMEX> was up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222.3</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215.3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as recently as March</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> rise marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> straight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> gain for the indicator , which uses the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> average as a base of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> .
     In contrast , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year</TIMEX> .
     Its ragged behavior through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">much of 1989</TIMEX> has prompted some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters</ENAMEX> to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> . But the far stronger showing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey H. Moore</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">facility</ENAMEX> .
     A leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on the business cycle , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> also is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Cycle Dating Group</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> that decides for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> when expansions and recessions begin and end .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .
     `` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tracks</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> reports .
     Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> foresee uninterrupted economic growth through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the rest of this year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> as well .
     They expect a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 %</NUMEX> rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .
     Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> 's index of leading indicators .
     Over the full post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> era , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> index , on the average , has entered sustained declines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">14 months</TIMEX> before the onset of recessions and turned up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight months</TIMEX> before recoveries .
     The comparable lead times for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 months</TIMEX> before recessions and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only three months</TIMEX> before recoveries .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> , before the stock market crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> that ushered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression</ENAMEX> .
     The indicator reached a peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1929</TIMEX> and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
     `` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> says .
     A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> corporate bond-price index , which is not a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> index .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the bond measure was at its highest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> average since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1987</TIMEX> .
     It also rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , while the stock market sagged .
     Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home-building permits .
     Notably absent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> index is the stock market , which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">As recently as 1975</TIMEX> , the stock market -- as reflected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> common stocks -- was rated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Bureau of Economic Research</ENAMEX> as the best of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> leading indicators that then made up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> index .
     It was assigned a mark of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> out of a possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> , compared with scores ranging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 69</NUMEX> for the other components .
     The stock market has lost some precursory power , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center</ENAMEX> claim , because of the growing impact of international developments . `` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .
     He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .

     An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> is standing trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> .
     This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election .
     The most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX>-dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> 's `` crime '' was writing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">commission</ENAMEX> charged with overseeing the election 's fairness , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan O'Linn</ENAMEX> , was openly sympathetic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO</ENAMEX> .
     Shortly after that , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Linn</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Stanley</ENAMEX> arrested and his passport confiscated .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator general</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , which made it a crime punishable by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to `` insult , disparate or belittle '' the election <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">commission</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO</ENAMEX> starts running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     To the extent Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Namibian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> were above all else the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of suppression by neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO</ENAMEX> has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.

     The elections are set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 7</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Press International</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX>-based conservative wire service , visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> to report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX>-monitored election campaign .
     He interviewed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Linn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> charged with investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Linn</ENAMEX> was openly sympathetic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO</ENAMEX> and indeed had defended its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> 's article was published in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Namibian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Linn</ENAMEX> had criminal charges brought against their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press</ENAMEX> have protested Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> 's detention .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> 's elections .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">SWAPO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> are intimidating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results .
     It now has the chance to redress that record in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Namibia</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> and the human-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> should insist that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> and his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> be released and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">United Nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitors</ENAMEX> make certain that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Linn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> investigates election complaints from all sides .

     Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness .
     Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Gold</ENAMEX> , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day</TIMEX> as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Copper</ENAMEX> and crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> reacted sharply to the concern that a crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Copper</ENAMEX> fell and showed little rebound through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved .
     Crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss .
     Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> was nervous and showed small declines .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybean</ENAMEX> prices rose slightly .
     Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> .
     In commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> : PRECIOUS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">METALS</ENAMEX> : Futures prices were moderately higher as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> gave up some of its early gains and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">platinum</ENAMEX> behaved independently , first falling and then later rising .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Silver</ENAMEX> performed quietly .
     The spot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> gold price rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 367.30</NUMEX> an ounce .
     The more active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> settled with a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.90</NUMEX> an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 371.20</NUMEX> , after trading <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 374</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">silver</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3 cents</NUMEX> an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.163</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Platinum</ENAMEX> behaved more like an industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metal</ENAMEX> , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Gold</ENAMEX> was nowhere the spectacular performer it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late-in-the-day</TIMEX> nose dive , so it could n't react to it .
     Back on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday , Oct. 16 , l987</TIMEX> , the stock market declined during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> contract <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 8.70</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 471.60</NUMEX> , and the more deferred positions , due to mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as late as March 1989</TIMEX> , rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 9.60</NUMEX> .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> contract tacked on further gains , rising to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 491.50</NUMEX> for a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 20</NUMEX> on top of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> advances , before giving up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 10</NUMEX> of that at the close .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</NUMEX> was miniscule compared with that .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Cardillo</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Josephthal &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market . `` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardillo</ENAMEX> .
     There 's a good chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> will retain its gains and rise further , he said .
     He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .
     Finally , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardillo</ENAMEX> , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gold</ENAMEX> , he said .
     ENERGY :
     Worried that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> , closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.59</NUMEX> a barrel for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> was due for a correction anyhow , following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several days</TIMEX> of significant gains .
     But most market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> agreed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> increased its production ceiling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> based on projections of robust demand .
     So any bearish indicator , such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well .
     Indeed , after reacting early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the trading day</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> took note of the stock market 's partial recovery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">COPPER</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract declined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.05 cents</NUMEX> a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2745</NUMEX> .
     Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">copper</ENAMEX> use .
     But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">copper</ENAMEX> as word spread that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> was about over , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .

     However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .

Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , caused prices to decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Simon</ENAMEX> , cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .

     However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> said .
     That selling continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and kept prices under pressure , he said .
     Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Delta</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming weekend</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> said .

     A price-depressing factor , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said , was that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> , which had been expected to buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">around 200,000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> in the world market , did n't make any purchases .

     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market . `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> , it could buy at lower prices , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Ganes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .

     The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> speculated that the stock market plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> will linger in the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supermarket</ENAMEX> , which would hurt demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> .
     The price of the hog contract for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> delivery dropped its maximum permissible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> limit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 cents</NUMEX> a pound .
