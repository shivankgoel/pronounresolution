     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PANHANDLER</ENAMEX> approaches , makes his pitch .
     It may be straightforward -- he wants money for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> -- or incredibly convoluted ; his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> is at this very moment near death in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hoboken</ENAMEX> , he has lost his wallet and has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 1.22</NUMEX> in change to put toward a bus ticket costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.83</NUMEX> , and wo n't you give him the difference ?
     No ?
     Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address ...
     Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Night Train Express</ENAMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
     But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> to help fight <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , famine , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse , or what have you .
     Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
     But will it ?
     In a distressing number of cases , no .
     In fact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> sometimes might be better off giving the money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panhandler</ENAMEX> : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 billion</NUMEX> was donated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> .
     While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> on the good works it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> , including fraudulent expenses .
     In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> .
     It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> , and downright fraud .
     But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
     State law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enforcers</ENAMEX> can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Council of Better Business Bureaus</ENAMEX> are not encouraging .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Philanthropic Advisory Service</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">BBB</ENAMEX> reviews <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every year</TIMEX> , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> was supposedly established .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Service</ENAMEX> figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> of the money taken in should be spent on program .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly a third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> reviewed flunk the test .
     Which , it should be added , does n't prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> from raking in a lot of money anyway .
     Without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
     On this basis , `` there 's no way the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> can know a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> from a bad one , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ormstedt</ENAMEX> , an assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> just get taken . ''
     Including those , he contends , who put <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 million</NUMEX> into the kitty for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Vietnam Veterans Service Center</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has sued these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> in state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82 %</NUMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ormstedt</ENAMEX> , went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund raisers</ENAMEX> and most of the rest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who ran the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> and to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> -- for fur coats , trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , Lucullan restaurant tabs .
     The telephone number for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shelton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , has been disconnected , and the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> could n't be located .
     Running a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> does cost money , but reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> manage to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Arthritis Foundation</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Way of America</ENAMEX> all say that they spend roughly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> of their income on programs , not overhead .
     With some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> , however , it s the other way around .
     The fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Children 's Cancer Society </ENAMEX>, for example , took in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to finance bone-marrow transplants for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     By the time it paid its expenses it only had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120,000</NUMEX> left -- not enough to treat even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> is suing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> for fraud in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telesystems Marketing Inc.</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund raiser</ENAMEX> .
     Both deny wrongdoing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> to come .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Burns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telesystems</ENAMEX> , says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case , noting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> have signed on as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clients</ENAMEX> because they were impressed with the amount he raised for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Children 's</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , a state court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> has allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> to go on soliciting funds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Enforcers</ENAMEX> ca n't put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> out of business simply because they spend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> 's share of their income on fund raising .
     State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
     It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-amendment right to freedom of expression .
     This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> recently .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> alone has put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of them out of business over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past couple of years</TIMEX> , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
     In making cases , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund raisers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , for instance , currently has under investigation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> drumming up funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> soliciting there .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Enforcers</ENAMEX> pay special attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorneys general</ENAMEX> in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , are already suing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Watson & Hughey Co.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Alexandria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outfit</ENAMEX> that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Heart Disease Foundation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cancer Fund of America</ENAMEX> .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> 's suit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Watson & Hughey</ENAMEX> sent mailings indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 1,000</NUMEX> on top of them , if they contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 7</NUMEX> .
     But the total value of the prizes was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 5,000</NUMEX> and most `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> '' will receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 10 cents</NUMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     The suit is still pending in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Watson & Hughey</ENAMEX> has denied the allegations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> decline to comment further .
     While they can target some of the most obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">miscreants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enforcers</ENAMEX> concede that they are only scratching the surface .
     There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit .
     The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
     What it does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself .
     `` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ! ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri </ENAMEX>.
     `` By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> cites a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-page mailing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Cancer Council</ENAMEX> that offers a chance to win <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> in gold bullion to those giving <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 5</NUMEX> to cancer education .
     `` A few boilerplate warnings about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> appear but that 's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">only two inches</NUMEX> in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pages .
     I think some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> does anything except write these letters , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> did n't return repeated phone calls .
     Many fly-by-night <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
     The established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
     `` We ca n't police the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> that have sprung up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> using part of our name .
     Most of them do n't last for long , but in the meantime all we can do is tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they are n't connected with us , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Heart Association</ENAMEX> .
     And sometimes a reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> with a household name gets used and does n't even know it .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rockford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12,591</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> using the name and logo of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</ENAMEX> , without permission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MADD</ENAMEX> did n't learn of the fund raising until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> sent it a check for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 613</NUMEX> , along with a letter saying that was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charity</ENAMEX> 's `` share . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> won a court order to prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> from raising further funds without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MADD</ENAMEX> 's permission .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rockford</ENAMEX> , law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> report .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denise McDonald</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MADD </ENAMEX>, says , `` It 's scary , because anybody could do this . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> , a crucial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">participant</ENAMEX> in the proposed buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> , washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     Specifically , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> officially withdrew its support for the previous <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share bid in a terse statement that said `` the original deal is closed . ''
     Company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said later that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> believes its involvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> when the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , which also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , failed to obtain financing for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> transaction .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     However , company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they plan to take `` no initiatives '' to resurrect the transaction , and `` are n't aware '' of any restructured bid in the making .
     Collectively , the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> will ever get off the ground .
     The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , with no signs or statements from the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> to indicate that any progress has taken place .
     However , in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out .
     Pilot union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick C. Dubinsky</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> will begin meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and will work through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> to devise a new proposal to present to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> `` at the earliest time possible . ''
     Pilot union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's participation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> declined to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's statement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen M. Wolf</ENAMEX> , who is leading the management end of the buy-out , has n't provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal .
     In another setback <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's machinist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws .
     In an effort to derail the buy-out , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> has already called for investigations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> .
     But there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> bright spot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> flight-attendants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake .
     The pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> is practical and achievable . ''
     Still , without the assurance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways </ENAMEX>' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> to convince already-reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's original investment represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 %</NUMEX> of the cash equity contribution for the bid .
     Under the previous plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> would have received a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> in exchange for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> equity investment , with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> stake going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King </ENAMEX>, was concerned about news reports indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> .
     The previous reports were based on remarks by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Stevens</ENAMEX> , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's stock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock dropped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.625</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190.125</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">923,500</NUMEX> shares in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> declined to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's statement .
     In an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones Professional Investor Report</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said , `` We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
     We 're not rushing into anything .
     We do n't want to be party to a second rejection . ''
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment .
     The original transaction fell through on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> approved the plan at a special meeting after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> also seemed eager to place blame on its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> .
     `` The -LCB- buy-out -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">consortium</ENAMEX> ceased to exist because our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> were not capable of organizing the financing , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest 's Airlines</ENAMEX> ' new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> to restructure the equity contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> .
     Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> 's statements since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> .
     Even before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's announcement , pilot union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> had been meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to consider their options .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paul , Weiss , Rifkind Wharton & Garrison</ENAMEX> .
     They also unanimously re-elected Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubinsky </ENAMEX>, the union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> who has led the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2-year</TIMEX> fight to take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid .
     They have maintained that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> remain interested in financing the transaction .
     The buy-out fell through after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> , the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in the transaction , failed to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.2 billion</NUMEX> in financing needed for the plan .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's legislative priority .
     A core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets .
     The plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a vigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of the capital-gains tax cut , called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">group</ENAMEX> to meet with him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> urged them to desist .
     Afterward , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned .
     The decision is a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , who needs the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> to pass the tax cut through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX>-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> .
     Having a proposal sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> would have given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> an advantage .
     Having only a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> measure makes the task harder .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     He said a clear majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> to overcome any procedural hurdle the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> might erect .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> , buoyed by his victory among fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> , strongly disagreed .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> has been predicting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's initiative would fail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , in an interview , he added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's first victory came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .
     That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version of the bill does include the tax cut .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation .
     To help lay the groundwork for that fight , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> plans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next week</TIMEX> to meet at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> apparently will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> bill to push , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> 's , and at least some of the dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> plan to support it .
     `` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Okla.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan , as expected , would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to exclude from income <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than one year</TIMEX> .
     The exclusion would rise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percentage points for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven years</TIMEX> .
     The exclusion would apply to assets sold after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> .
     As an alternative , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than three years</TIMEX> would be cut to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> from the current top rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> .
     That rate would gradually decline to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 29 %</NUMEX> for corporate assets held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan also would include a proposal , designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roth</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , education expenses and medical expenses .
     Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> 's net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,524,000</NUMEX> included a benefit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,640,000</NUMEX> from an accounting change .
     Revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 449 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 441.1 million</NUMEX> .
     In an interview , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pemberton Hutchinson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest nine months</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX> said , total coal sales rose to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 14.6 million tons</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 14.3 million tons</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     In addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 72 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 96 million</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1</TIMEX> .
     He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming quarters</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland</ENAMEX> 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Appalachia</ENAMEX> region .
     The operating territory includes coal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">terminals</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Ohio River</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland</ENAMEX> exports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a fourth</NUMEX> of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> produced by others that is used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> overseas .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland</ENAMEX> has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .
     Marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> and assets have been sold .
     The size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> has been reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 140</NUMEX> salaried management jobs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> wage positions have been eliminated .
     Even perks have been reduced .
     For example , the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> himself now pays <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of the cost of his health benefits ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> used to pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> .
     `` I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX> said of the restructuring program .
     `` Much of what we set out to do is completed . ''
     But he cautioned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland </ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third quarter</TIMEX> is typically better than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> , so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> `` should n't just multiply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> difference , he said , is that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> has significantly fewer workdays because of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">holidays</TIMEX> and the hunting season .
     `` I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said .
     `` We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
     It 's a process that never really ends . ''
     Nevertheless , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX> predicted that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> would be `` solidly profitable '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland</ENAMEX> and that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> would bring `` more of the same .

     An accounting adjustment made net income <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     In a move that complements the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's basic strategy , its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland Energy Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> is developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> coal-fired cogeneration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> .
     Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> buy will come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westmoreland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX> predicted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> results in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> `` will be exciting . ''

     WALL STREET , SHAKE hands with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the futuristic novel `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">1984</ENAMEX> '' invented a language called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Newspeak</ENAMEX> that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is , anything negative about the policies and practices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start .
     Its language -- call it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Streetspeak</ENAMEX> -- is increasingly mellifluous , reassuring , and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better , safer or cheaper than they really are .
     When something undeniably nasty happens , a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear , much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> .
     For example , we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Wrong .
     According to some of the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panjandrums</ENAMEX> of the market , it never happened .
     In their lexicon the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX>-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , was just a big blip .
     Trotting out a much-beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Streetspeak</ENAMEX> term , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Phelan</ENAMEX> recently declared that history would record the event as only `` a major technical correction . ''
     -LRB- Another much-beloved saying , however , this one in plain <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , holds that if something walks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> and quacks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> , it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 29 , 1929</TIMEX> -- a date <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DJ</ENAMEX> industrials fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.8 %</NUMEX> .
     In the `` technical correction '' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , they lost a whopping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.6 %</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX> hear a lot of this stuff from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who try to sell them stock .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> used to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> could n't raise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> on the phone .
     Either way , the word `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> '' is clearly out of favor .
     Of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> still calls its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> , they are `` financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> . ''
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Bache Securities</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> , they are `` account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> . ''
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , they are `` investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> . ''
     Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified , broad-scale competence and expertise in selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's myriad financial products .
     It is a competence and expertise that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle , do n't feel .
     `` It s almost product de jour , '' grouses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>.
     The transmogrified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> never let the C-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product .
     The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them , either .
     A case in point : `` government-plus '' bond funds .
     What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds ?
     What could be better than getting a tad more income from them -LRB- the plus -RRB- than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ?
     Indeed , conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , many of them elderly , have poured <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 50 billion</NUMEX> into such funds , which promise fatter yields than ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX> 's game .
     When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished , look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker .
     This seems to be happening now to limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> , many of which either have gone into the tank in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
     They are still being sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks they had under the old label .
     In such cases , the game has n't changed , only the name .
     In others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has changed .
     For example , `` no load '' mutual funds remain a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission .
     Getting out of them , however , may be a different story now .
     Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> -- when an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> sells his shares .
     Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds ?
     The mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
     And do n't expect anyone to change the term `` blue chip , '' either , even though some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> , for one , is still a favorite of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widows</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orphans</ENAMEX> and trust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">departments</ENAMEX> -- but shorn of its regional telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> and exposed to competition on every side , it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture .
     Also , blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Biehl</ENAMEX> , a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Mateo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , blames that on the advent of program trading , in which computers used by big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail .
     Blue chips , he says , `` are now being referred to as poker chips . ''
     Finally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did .
     Before the takeover mania of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '80s</TIMEX> , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects .
     Now , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biehl</ENAMEX> , value investing often means `` looking for downtrodden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with terrible management that are in real trouble . ''
     To institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , he adds , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with value is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> at risk of being swallowed up .

     I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     If the whole story were told , it would read something like this :
     -- During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
     -- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings -LRB- and management bonuses -RRB- ; the price , a sea of bad loans .
     -- For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past several years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , lacking a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> to underwrite their bad LDC credits .
     -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans -LRB- the Brady Plan -RRB- .
     -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">navy</ENAMEX> , they have no alternative but to go along .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was about to make a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.4 billion</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> and needed someone to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> jumped at the chance .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> , he was on his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to meet with top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> .
     And before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> was out , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> had offered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
     Not only that , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also agreed to give them a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's future profits and buy their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 40 %</NUMEX> more than the market value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> sticking point : The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> had a prior commitment .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just seven months earlier</TIMEX> , they had signed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> exclusive contract to make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> for which they had just produced the smash hit `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batman</ENAMEX> . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> figured that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Ross</ENAMEX> , would empathize and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> go , knowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . ''
     He figured wrong .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , following fruitless settlement talks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , now merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX> , filed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> breach of contract suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Los Angeles Superior Court</ENAMEX> against both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> promptly countersued , charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> movie business .
     The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides : As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> puts it , `` It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War III</ENAMEX> . ''
     That <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> who are n't all that well known outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> could occasion such a clash of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">titans</ENAMEX> suggests how desperate the quest for proven <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> is in the movie business .
     And they are a very odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in any case .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> was raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> and educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     He is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> with a string of academic degrees .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> is a high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropout</ENAMEX> who came to fame as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbra Streisand</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairdresser</ENAMEX> .
     Yet , they are far and away the most prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> .
     And despite their share of duds , they make movies that make money .
     That is a skill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> badly needs -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is loath to lose .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good summer</TIMEX> with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Ghostbusters II</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">When Harry Met Sally</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Pictures</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> have been thrashing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> at the box office .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years</TIMEX> of management turmoil , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> sorely needs a stable , savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> are n't universally loved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> but they are well connected .
     Their stock in trade as `` executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios</ENAMEX> to bankroll and distribute them .
     Sometimes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Flashdance</ENAMEX> , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Color Purple</ENAMEX> . ''
     It falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Rainman</ENAMEX> , '' for instance , Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> had virtually nothing to do with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success .
     Sometimes , as with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batman</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> really do make the film .
     In that case , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> acquired the rights in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">11 months</TIMEX> hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production .
     `` They 're the best production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> around , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian De Palma </ENAMEX>, beholden to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> for hiring him to direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> movie of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe</ENAMEX> 's novel `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bonfire of the Vanities</ENAMEX> . ''
     On that film , which is to start shooting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months</TIMEX> , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> and discussing the development of the script .
     And when you 're making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Palma</ENAMEX> adds .
     `` I wish they were around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> a day . ''
     And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> was working on a competing film , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     More recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> beat out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , reportedly including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> , for rights to the life story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chico Mendes</ENAMEX> , the murdered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> who fought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Amazon</ENAMEX> rain forest .
     Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> assiduously courted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> , showing her a tape of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Gorillas in the Mist</ENAMEX> '' to impress her with the quality of their work .
     Money helped , too .
     Ultimately , they paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 million</NUMEX> for the rights .
     -LRB- The sale caused a rift between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> and some of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> .
     Some of the money will go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chico Mendes Foundation</ENAMEX> , but it is n't earmarked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> trying to save the rain forest . -RRB-
     It 's hardly astonishing -LRB- given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> 's track record -RRB- that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> wants Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> .
     But it is puzzling to some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> rushed to hire them without clearing up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> situation <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> .
     Some note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and letting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> stay on to fulfill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> contract .
     But though `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in town may ask why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> , it 's good to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , and obviously the chemistry works , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Tisch </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> who once worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> .
     `` This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- it s about whether the ink is red or black .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> got together with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> , by then a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> in his own right , after the death of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart </ENAMEX>.
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> produced a number of hits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and others , their record was n't always so impressive .

''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> maintain that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">powerhouse</ENAMEX> , but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> never felt threatened until they linked up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> .

     `` They always listened , but they never acted , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says .

     The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
     But it paled by comparison to what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was to offer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> : the chance , at last , to run a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 50 million</NUMEX> in deferred compensation , up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's future cash flow , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> of the future appreciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's market value , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> salaries of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 million</NUMEX> for each .

     But in affidavits filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> deny that such an oral agreement was ever made .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> in his affidavit acknowledges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreed to release the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> but says that situation was altogether different .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> requested a release in advance .
     Moreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> pictures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> was n't as strong as it is now .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> itself was in negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's interest to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> by permitting them to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said in his affidavit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> go off to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> .
     At the very least , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> clearly sees an opportunity to use the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to get a pound of flesh from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> .
     During settlement talks , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> demanded such things as cable TV rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> movies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> involved in the talks .
     In any settlement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is almost certain to demand rights to most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 or so</NUMEX> projects Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> have locked up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> , notably sequels to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batman</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer before taking it up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .

     THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities . ''
     Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
     And there 's more .
     The assets backing the securities come from some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's biggest -- and most secure -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     Most earn high ratings from credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     Their yields are higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> issues .
     And the booming market has already attracted many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's biggest institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Ready to jump ?
     Well , think twice .
     The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     But the simplicity may be misleading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Skeptics</ENAMEX> say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
     They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .
     Moreover , the securities were introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only about 4 1\/2 years ago</TIMEX> ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
     `` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Carney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the investment securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">comptroller</ENAMEX> of the currency .
     `` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . ''
     Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring of 1985</TIMEX> , financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alchemists</ENAMEX> have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
     They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
     They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
     Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina</ENAMEX> and other debt-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     And the biggest volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds . ''
     `` This is the heyday of debt , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Grant </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grant 's Interest Rate Observer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newsletter</ENAMEX> .
     `` Before the sun sets on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '80s</TIMEX> , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . ''
     The result is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 billion</NUMEX> market , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities Data Co .</ENAMEX>
     That includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 9.5 billion</NUMEX> issued through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August of this year</TIMEX> , up sharply from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 billion</NUMEX> in the comparable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> period -- and more than in all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Most issues have been sold to professional money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">funds</ENAMEX> , bank trust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">departments</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     But wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> also have been jumping in , and lately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> have been pushing smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> into the asset-backed market .
     The entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> .
     `` We expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Addiss</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The process typically begins when an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears , Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> then issues securities -- generally due in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years or less</TIMEX> -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Enthusiasts</ENAMEX> say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">issuers</ENAMEX> , while providing a valuable new investment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig J. Goldberg </ENAMEX>, managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the asset-backed securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
     Consider a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> offering of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> and backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> credit-card receivables .
     The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 0.5</NUMEX> percentage point above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues .
     On a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> investment , that 's a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 50</NUMEX> a year .
     That kind of spread can be critical for money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> .
     But for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless .
     `` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> basis points -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> percentage point -RRB- becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant </ENAMEX>.
     `` But if you 're an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . ''
     Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
     That 's why some investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Powers</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> 's private banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in high-tax <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> has purchased asset-backed issues for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans .
     He points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> buying smaller amounts .
     Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
     The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues .
     That could make it tricky for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
     That 's particularly true , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans .
     `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan S. Paris</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">European Investors Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> investment-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who wants to know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , can simply check newspaper listings .
     There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
     Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
     It is n't .
     The front cover of the prospectus for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank N.A.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> or any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> thereof . ''
     In other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> to come to the rescue .
     The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> .
     That means <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
     That also is n't easy .
     Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
     Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
     Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
     Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> is so slim .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper .
     When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> could run into unexpected difficulties .
     If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> supports .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Underwriters</ENAMEX> insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
     But despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
     At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may be taking a heady gamble that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> will be able to repay loans in hard times .
     At the very least , a recession would prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
     That could widen the yield spread between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
     But it could be much worse .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are especially wary of credit-card issues .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , credit-card loans are unsecured .
     In addition , they fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have been overeager to issue cards to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> -- giving cards to too many big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spenders</ENAMEX> who will default during a recession .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A day</TIMEX> of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> government bonds , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Corcoran</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc.</ENAMEX> , an investment advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues ?
     `` Nope , we still say to stick with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corcoran</ENAMEX> replies .
     Ratings , he notes , `` are subject to change . ''
     All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     And it reminds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</ENAMEX> , of what he calls `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeVoe</ENAMEX> 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> :

     IF YOU FORCE financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-word sentence : Diversify .
     Judging by a poll of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Erdos & Morgan Inc.</ENAMEX> , serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have taken that advice to heart .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .
     Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
     By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> have protected themselves against squalls in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate .
     For example , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 88 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> owned stock -LRB- down slightly from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</NUMEX> in a similar poll <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 17.5 %</NUMEX> said they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> their money in the stock market .
     Similarly , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> own municipal bonds .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 6 % to 7 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were committing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> their funds to either of those alternatives .
     The poll , conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Aug. 7-28</TIMEX> , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> on a variety of other topics .
     It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood .
     Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sent a questionnaire , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">951</NUMEX> replied .
     The response rate , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 63 %</NUMEX> , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
     The results ca n't be extrapolated to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , though .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are relatively affluent , with a median household income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 75,000</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99,000</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</NUMEX> -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250,000</NUMEX> or more , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> said it was worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> or more .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     For example , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> said they expect a recession within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 months</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 8 %</NUMEX> were expecting a recession .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">An additional 56 %</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> expect the economy to slow down during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next 12 months</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 42 %</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> anticipated slowing growth .
     Apparently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
     A slim majority -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> -RRB- think stock prices will be higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1990</TIMEX> than they were in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1989</TIMEX> .
     Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 50 %</NUMEX> expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next 12 months</TIMEX> .
     By contrast , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 32 %</NUMEX> expect an increase in the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> .
     Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe inflation remains under control .
     Even though <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 12 %</NUMEX> actually predicted a recession , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly a third</NUMEX> said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
     For the most part , the changes were `` slight . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 31 %</NUMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 22 %</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> .
     Most own <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to 10</NUMEX> stocks , and buy or sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than three</NUMEX> times a year .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 71 %</NUMEX> had bought some stock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 57 %</NUMEX> had sold any .
     But the lurking shadow of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> 's stock-market crash still seems dark .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 33 %</NUMEX> considered another crash `` likely , '' while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 63 %</NUMEX> said one is `` unlikely . ''
     Those percentages hardly changed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> 's poll .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 60 %</NUMEX> of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 25 %</NUMEX> of their money in stocks .
     But as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 50 %</NUMEX> actually had stock-market investments of that size .

     Electronic theft by foreign and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> and disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> is costing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
     That was the message delivered by government and private security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all-day</TIMEX> conference on corporate electronic espionage .
     `` Hostile and even friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> routinely steal information from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and share it with their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel D.

     It `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Van Cleave</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Affairs</ENAMEX> .
     The conference was jointly sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">New York Institute of Technology School of Management</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association</ENAMEX> , a joint industry-government trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     Any secret can be pirated , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> said , if it is transmitted over the air .
     Even rank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX> can do it if they spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand dollars</NUMEX> for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
     They need only position themselves near a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's satellite dish and wait .
     `` You can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">competitors</ENAMEX> stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matchett</ENAMEX> said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . ''
     The only way to catch an electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX> , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information .
     Even though electronic espionage may cost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> said .
     By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> on electronic security , and are expected to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     Already many foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , have their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cryptographers</ENAMEX> , conference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> reported .
     Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , for example , doubling as foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory .
     He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> to read .
     No personal computer , not even the one on a chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> 's desk , is safe , this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> noted .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.

     Under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goode</ENAMEX> said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
     He cited the case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> who recently put out bids via telex for an oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tanker</ENAMEX> to pick up a cargo of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> stepped deeper into the contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught BioSciences Inc.</ENAMEX> by reaching an unusual agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chiron Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">University</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> agreed to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 million Canadian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.3 million</NUMEX> -RRB- over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> on research at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">University</ENAMEX> is seeking an injunction against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> bid , arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> 's predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> agreed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> 's ownership would n't be transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> are successful with their lower bid .
     It said the new agreement would `` replace '' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> takeover .
     `` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> , this accord would enhance research and development in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Keffer </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of research .

     In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques-Francois Martin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director general</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is still determined to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> .
     While he did n't comment directly on the pact between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> , he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> can transfer new products and technologies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> more rapidly than other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> `` not currently producing and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccines</ENAMEX> -LCB- who -RCB- can only promise this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">some ... years</TIMEX> in the future .

     Row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of the Upper Reserved at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> is a lofty perch , only a few steps from the very top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stands</ENAMEX> .
     From my orange seat , I looked over the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few minutes</TIMEX> before what was to have been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> game of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> .
     It was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five in the afternoon</TIMEX> , but that was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> time .
     Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the work day</TIMEX> was already over , so I did n't have to feel guilty .
     Even still , I did feel self-indulgent , and I could n't help remembering my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> 's contempt for a rich medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> who would go to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Tigers</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer afternoons</TIMEX> .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballpark</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> , was not a classic baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> -- too symmetrical , too much bald concrete .
     And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Yankee Stadium</ENAMEX> .
     But I liked the easy friendliness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around me , liked it that they 'd brought their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , found it charming that , true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of the future , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event .
     Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> .
     Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it ?
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The day</TIMEX> was saturated with the weight of its own impending history .
     Long lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> waited to buy special souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> postcards with official postmarks .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of us had paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5</NUMEX> for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> trivia , its historical photographs of great moments in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> past , and its instructions , in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> , for filling in the scorecard .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pitcher</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lanzador</ENAMEX> .
     Homerun = jonron .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Players</ENAMEX> ran out on the field way below , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stands</ENAMEX> began to reverberate .
     It must be a local custom , I thought , stamping feet to welcome the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> .
     But then the noise turned into a roar .
     And no one was shouting .
     No one around me was saying anything .
     Because we all were busy riding a wave .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> atop a concrete wall , waiting for the wipeout .
     Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on .
     Then I remembered the quake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'71</TIMEX> , which I experienced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-story motel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     When the swaying of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> woke me up , I reasoned that a -RRB- I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southern California</ENAMEX> ; b -RRB- the bed was moving ; c -RRB- it must be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Magic Fingers</ENAMEX> bed that had short-circuited .
     Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened .
     What should I do ?
     Get out of the possibly collapsing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> to the parking lot .
     But the lot might split into crevasses , so I had better stand on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , which probably was wider than the average crevasse .
     Fortunately , the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> , while the world shook , I thought of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX> and then it struck me that this time was different .
     If I survived , I would have achieved every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> 's highest wish .
     I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment .
     What was my angle ?
     How would I file ?
     All these thoughts raced through my head in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 15 seconds</TIMEX> of the earthquake 's actual duration .
     The rest is , of course , history .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> did n't fall .
     The real tragedies occurred elsewhere , as we soon found out .
     But for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> there , relief abounded .
     A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> found her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> , who had been out buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">hotdog</ENAMEX> .
     The wall behind me was slightly deformed , but the center had held .
     And most of us waited for a while for the game to start .
     Then we began to file out , to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch .
     It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> that I really understood the point of all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Walkmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Watchmen</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> moved in clumps , clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus .
     In this way , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> itself was blacked out , we kept up to date on events .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> of the quake itself , I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> .
     Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     And by then , expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon .
     Darkness fell .
     But the broadcasts continued through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the blacked-out night</TIMEX> , with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> and firefighting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> district .
     By then , our little sand village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> had been linked with a global village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> .
     Everyone at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Stick</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> had started out as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> and ended up as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> had ended up with this dual role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> turned into unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     The outstanding example of this was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorist</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway .
     The tape was on tv before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> was out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall McLuhan</ENAMEX> , you should have been there at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that hour</TIMEX> .

     Shearson , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Rivkin </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thought some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> had was that a red-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages .

     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivkin</ENAMEX> insists that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish .
     Instead , he says , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver '' on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
     In a report on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's foundering economy , the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Statistical Bureau</ENAMEX> disclosed that industrial output <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> - the lowest growth rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Retail sales are plummeting , while consumer prices still are rising .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation .
     `` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
     `` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . ''
     A lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> predict <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming year</TIMEX> will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
     Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> suddenly reverses course , wages for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> wo n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest .
     The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
     -LRB- Industrial output surged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , while inflation peaked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last February</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 30 %</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> to restrict operations to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two or three days</TIMEX> a week .
     In Western , market-driven <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> , which ate up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 billion</NUMEX> in bailouts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> . Nor are any of these inefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">monoliths</ENAMEX> likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
     Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> , which have fallen into disfavor as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> re-emphasize an orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX> preference for public ownership .
     `` When the going gets rough , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> .
     Reports of an economy near recession come as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> prepare a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> plenum for sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few weeks</TIMEX> .
     The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> .
     But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit .
     That would benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sino</ENAMEX>-foreign joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
     A dangerous buildup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">People 's Bank of China</ENAMEX> , the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , to allocate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.4 billion</NUMEX> in short-term loans to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn</TIMEX> harvest , the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">China Daily</ENAMEX> reported .
     But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
     The cycle has been repeated several times since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> began reforming its planned economy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> .
     And , because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     The statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureau</ENAMEX> 's report , cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">China Daily</ENAMEX> , notes that industrial output in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29.4 billion</NUMEX> , a rise of just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Output declined in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">provinces</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Jiangsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Zhejiang</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key coastal areas , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">breadbasket</ENAMEX> .
     Production in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">powerhouse</ENAMEX> and the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">source</ENAMEX> of tax revenue for the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> .
     Nationwide , output of light industrial products declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> -- `` the first decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> , '' a bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">China Daily</ENAMEX> .
     In an unusually direct statement , the bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> recommended that state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> extend more credit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeepers</ENAMEX> so that they can purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' goods .
     `` This will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are lining up for tax goodies all over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> .

     Big auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes .
     And heavy-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit .
     `` Everything is up for grabs , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Groom</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> for mutual life-insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Juliano </ENAMEX>, the head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . ''
     The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> act have been threatened as well .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with the highest incomes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> .
     As part of the same bill , the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> also voted in favor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in narrow tax breaks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , in what committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Pryor</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> would range from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pineapple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> to rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> to tuxedo-rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     To be sure , the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> bill .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> agree that the streamlining was temporary .
     Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions .
     `` There is n't any doubt that the thread of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'86</TIMEX> code has been given a mighty tug , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Downey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .

     Referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairmen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> tax-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> , he adds , `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next year</TIMEX> , every special-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> is going to be there knocking on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> 's door , on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> 's door . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are n't waiting that long .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> who want to open their own special loopholes .
     `` It 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Swiss-cheese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cheese</ENAMEX> smells pretty good , '' commented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> who was watching the proceedings .
     Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> bill , are encouraged .
     The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation -LRB- write-offs -RRB- or investment credits , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Huard </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Manufacturers</ENAMEX> .
     Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charls Walker</ENAMEX> is planning a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring</TIMEX> conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve `` competitiveness . ''
     In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train .
     Real-estate interests , for example , are protesting an omission in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's capital-gains proposal : It does n't include real-estate gains .
     `` If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains , they certainly want to be part of it , '' says real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Thevenot</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Concord Associates</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed tax bill , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thevenot</ENAMEX> got his wish ; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Antique Dealers</ENAMEX> are still trying to get theirs .
     They have sent a letter to congressional tax-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment .
     `` Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets , '' the letter states .
     All of this talk is antithetical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tax Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> an advantage over others .
     The goal was to tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wealthy</ENAMEX> to escape taxes .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the major ways that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tax-writers</ENAMEX> managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible .
     Many other tax benefits also were swept away .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , with prodding from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
     It appears likely that , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> or next , some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted .
     Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created .
     The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them .
     `` The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'86</TIMEX> act was a fluke .
     They wanted reform and they got a revolution , '' says overhaul advocate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willis Gradison</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     So , is the tax code now open game again ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juliano</ENAMEX> thinks so .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Chandler</ENAMEX> , in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1950</TIMEX> letter defending a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> book , likened a champion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to a baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champ</ENAMEX> has lost his stuff , the great mystery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> wrote , `` when he can no longer throw the high hard one , he throws his heart instead .
     He throws something .
     He does n't just walk off the mound and weep . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> might have been predicting the course of his own career .
     His last published novel featuring private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Marlowe </ENAMEX>, the inferior `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Playback</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1958</TIMEX> -RRB- , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work .
     When he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1959</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> left behind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> chapters of yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> book , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Poodle Springs Story</ENAMEX> , '' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Champ</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> 's last pitch , apparently , was a screwball .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Parker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of several best sellers featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX> , a contemporary private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> mold , has with the blessings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> estate been hired to complete `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Poodle Springs Story</ENAMEX> . ''
     The result , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Poodle Springs</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Putnam 's</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- is an entertaining , easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> chronicle , full of hard-boiled wisecracks and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> color .
     If it does not quite have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> 's special magic -- well , at the end , neither did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> .
     As the book begins , a newly wed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> roars into the desert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Poodle -LRB- a.k.a . Palm -RRB- Springs</ENAMEX> at the wheel of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Fleetwood</ENAMEX> .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> is the rich and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Loring </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> who also appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Long Goodbye</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Playback</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> move into her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mansion</ENAMEX> and ca n't keep their hands off each other , even in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">houseman</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovebirds</ENAMEX> have a conflict .
     He wants to continue being a low-paid private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> , and she wants him to live off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the million dollars</NUMEX> she 's settled on him .
     That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> 's setup .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Poodle Springs</ENAMEX> high life , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> low life and various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> who hang their hats in both worlds .
     The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ohls</ENAMEX> , the `` good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> '' of previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> books who still does n't hesitate to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> jailed when it suits his purposes .
     The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> 's prose at its most pared down .
     All told , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect .
     But there are grounds for complaint .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> in catching on to a double identity scam -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> is supposed to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pro</ENAMEX> .
     More bothersome , there are several apparent anachronisms .
     Contact lenses , tank tops , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> openly working the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and the Tequila Sunrise <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocktail</ENAMEX> all seem out of place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> .
     A little more care in re-creating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable .
