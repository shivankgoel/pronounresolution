     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">just months ago</TIMEX> was hemorrhaging financially , thinks it will be healthy enough soon to consider repurchasing public debt .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved fatal , now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls `` the data solutions '' business .
     `` I 'm not saying everything is hunky-dory , but we have completed the transition , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Price</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , said in an interview .
     `` Transition '' is a reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> restructuring effort .
     During that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> had losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> .
     Now , following asset sales that shrank revenue by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one-third</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> is flush with cash .
     So its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 172.5 million</NUMEX> in subordinated convertible debentures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     `` We 'd like to continue to reduce debt , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Perlman</ENAMEX> said .
     Noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is offering to buy back <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 154.2 million</NUMEX> in senior notes paying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 3\/4 %</NUMEX> , he said the response will help determine future debt-reduction efforts .
     The offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imprimis</ENAMEX> disk-drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagate Technology Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> , who is also acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> and the odds-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> to become the next chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is achieving `` modest positive cash flow from operations , and we expect that to continue into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> . ''
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has no intention of tapping its short-term bank lines `` for a good part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sometime next year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> will `` develop a new bank relationship , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> said .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">lenders</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> , has extended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 90 million</NUMEX> in revolving loans through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , as well as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 115 million</NUMEX> in standby letters of credit .
     Loan covenants require that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four-quarter</TIMEX> profitability test .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents</NUMEX> a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 763 million</NUMEX> .
     Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 484 million</NUMEX> , largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ticketron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> said future restructuring would be a question of strategy .
     `` We do n't need the cash . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ticketron</ENAMEX> 's automated wagering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , which operates lotteries in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , is not for sale , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     Rather , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> intends to bid for the coming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> lottery contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas , where `` there is great interest in games of skill . ''
     He would n't elaborate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> 's semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">VTC Inc.</ENAMEX> , continues to lose money , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> acknowledged , but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's strategy for keeping its computer products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> profitable -- it recently achieved profitability after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several quarters</TIMEX> of losses -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses .
     Partly , costs will be held down through strategic technology alliances , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> recently announced an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MIPS Computer Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> to jointly develop machines with simplified operating software .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Ousley</ENAMEX> , computer products group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , said such arrangements could help slash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> 's computer research and development costs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1990</TIMEX> .
     He disclosed that before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> scrapped its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ETA Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> supercomputer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past spring</TIMEX> , those costs were running at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 35 %</NUMEX> of group revenue .
     At the same time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> design projects were spiked , he said .
     Asked how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> hopes to expand its computer hardware <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ousley</ENAMEX> said it sees good opportunities in systems integration .
     `` We think we 're getting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 %</NUMEX> of the integration dollars our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are spending , '' he said .
     `` We 're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> , such as the scientific , engineering and academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> .
     Utilities management is a major commercial niche .
     Reviewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's scrape with disaster , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> conceded it had tried to do too much on its own .
     `` Absolutely , '' he said .
     But while its stock is selling at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> 's estimated breakup value , neither Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover .
     `` We 've been listed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidate</ENAMEX> for so long it 's not worth worrying about , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> .

     Well , the arrogant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> have spoken again -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Going for the Green</ENAMEX> , '' editorial , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 17</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Having resided in the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past seven years</TIMEX> , I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">tar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> ; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cheese</ENAMEX> and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit</ENAMEX> growing .
     Perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> , suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are `` whacky '' and referring to so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> as `` la-la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> . ''
     Strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> who seek to clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Boston Harbor</ENAMEX> or rid their beaches of medical waste .
     While there are no easy low-cost solutions , simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> and the world .
     If nothing else , such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> and encourage appropriate corrective action .
     Before your next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX>-bashing editorial , please spend more time out here witnessing the situation -- it just may change your view .

     I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> and its environmental movement , but picking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> to say it for you was a bad call .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> before it became fashionable among `` la-la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> . ''
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature .
     Obviously , it 's lost on you that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> -LRB- and in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> -RRB- consider themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> .
     As for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> being a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> run by liberal environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loonies</ENAMEX> , let 's not forget where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> came from .
     Perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> , who claimed that air pollution is caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> .
     But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?

     The illogic and inaccuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H.

     We may all hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will heed the scientific realities that their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> 's renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jukes</ENAMEX> provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their `` wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weepers</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate , rising demand for air travel and improved average yield -LRB- revenue received per ton of traffic transported <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a kilometer</NUMEX> -RRB- .

     If this battle were a movie , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> would be fighting over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common .
     In the opener , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> would agree to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> in a transaction valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 5 billion</NUMEX> .
     Shortly after that , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> would offer to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> and offer its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-chairmen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> , the chance to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> would fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> with the intention of telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven J. Ross</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> planned to end its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> contract to produce movies exclusively for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     That 's where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scripts would diverge .
     In affidavits filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Los Angeles Superior Court</ENAMEX> in connection with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> breach-of-contract suit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> brought against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> for hiring the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> tell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> tells another .
     In the affidavits , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says he was `` shocked '' when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> claims he reminded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX> , the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> , had `` repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept '' an offer such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's .
     In response , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> referred to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> with an `` obscenity '' and said : `` Tell them that they do n't have a job .
     You can take them with you . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> denies Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> ever said any such thing , and , in fact , denies virtually everything Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> say in their affidavits .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> will file another batch of documents contending that `` the essence of everything these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are saying is basically lies , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's chief outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Rabinowitz</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> is scheduled to rule on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's motion seeking to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> from going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> .
     The battery of legal documents filed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> dogfight .
     But they also make it clear that the first thing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> will have to decide is which , if any , version of events in this morass is fiction , and which fact .
     The matter may never even be tried in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> says that what it really wants is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to fulfill their contractual obligations , but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decade-long</TIMEX> relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> can ever be repaired .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , which is in the process of merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> , says it is willing to settle the matter out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     So far , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> has n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> do n't have much to gain from a protracted battle .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> , for its part , could decide that the cost of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> settlement or court fight is too high , choosing instead to find someone else to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> , although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> .
     In that case , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> might not suffer financially , but they would be left without their dream job of running a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> and with a considerably scarred relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , but other murkier issues will play a big role .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> are hanging much of their case on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's willingness <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to release the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> came up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> denies such an agreement was made , and disputes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> had on the matter .
     Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> ' current business dealings .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> say in their affidavits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stallone</ENAMEX> film `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tango and Cash</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says in his affidavit that the movie 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was told <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> was `` taking over '' the picture , and another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> would be giving all of the orders .
     Over his objections , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says , the film 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">release date</TIMEX> was moved up `` by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">many months</TIMEX> '' to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> , and plans for a soundtrack `` worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> '' were dropped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert de la Bouillaire</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> on the film , backs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> in a separate sworn declaration .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bouillaire</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Canton</ENAMEX> called him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> and said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> is `` off the picture .
     If he calls you up , just tell him everything is fine . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> also says the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> on the film , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Baird</ENAMEX> , told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> to screen the picture without telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stallone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Russell</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> .
     `` The less they know , the easier it is for us .
     If someone asks , just lie and tell them it will be done , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bouillaire</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baird</ENAMEX> told them .
     That , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabinowitz</ENAMEX> , is `` a total <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> lie . ''
     The movie , he says , is in its post-production stages of `` cleaning up the film . ''
     He says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> , as the contractual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> with consultation rights , have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> are still working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lot</ENAMEX> and consulting on various projects on a `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> basis , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> , in his affidavit , says that when he advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer at lunch on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 25</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says he brought to lunch a release document <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> had agreed to in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , when he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> made an aborted bid to buy part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says he had crossed out `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> '' with a red pen and written in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> , '' giving the document to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> .
     `` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> said absolutely nothing to indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> would have any objection to our assuming management positions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> , in his affidavit , does n't mention any hugging or congratulating .
     He says he told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> , would have a very negative impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> . ''
     He said he would contact Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and that , in a conference call , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> agreed they could n't let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> out of their contract .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , in his own affidavit , says he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> instructed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> would n't terminate their agreement .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> did convey that information and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> was `` crazy because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> deal , '' meaning , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says , that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> `` did not want to communicate to his new merger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> also says in his affidavit that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> `` told us that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> did not want us , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged , that there was no way ` to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> together , ' and that it would sue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">tons</NUMEX> of money . ''
     Moreover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> claims , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> told him that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> probably would n't object `` if it were anybody other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is a problem . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">side</ENAMEX> has said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> controlling important segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> entertainment business .
     Some in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> suggest Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> took encouragement from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canton</ENAMEX> too literally .
     According to this theory , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , hoping to strengthen their relationships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , encouraged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> in their ambitions to build a major entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in their affidavits deny ever telling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> they could get out of their written contract .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabinowitz</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> still wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to come back and fulfill their contract .
     `` They are like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mini-studio</ENAMEX> ; they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> projects in development for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used .
     For example , he says that since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> have developed over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> movie projects , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has `` passed '' or chosen not to produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 76</NUMEX> .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> deficit would have been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 10 billion</NUMEX> larger had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> been able to spend as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended on Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Trust Corp .</ENAMEX> could n't spend the money fast enough , the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     Nevertheless , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> deficit still exceeded the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 136 billion</NUMEX> target set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit-reduction law by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 billion</NUMEX> , a reminder of that law 's shortcomings .
     The law sets a deficit target of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 billion</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt , triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> law .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">side</ENAMEX> showed any sign of retreating .
     Meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , which would increase spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">future years</TIMEX> .
     Underscoring the size of the deficits of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> report showed that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time interest paid on the public debt -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240.86 billion</NUMEX> -- exceeded spending on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> , the single largest government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">program</ENAMEX> .
     In all , federal outlays amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.143 trillion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said .
     Federal revenues rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 990.79 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said a surge in tax receipts noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier in the year</TIMEX> did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> marked up its forecast by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , but that proved to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5 billion</NUMEX> too optimistic .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> ran a deficit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.16 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , compared with a surplus of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.17 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> .
     Outlays for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 105.39 billion</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87.57 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The increase reflects spending on the S&amp;L rescue as well as payroll and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> checks normally issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> that were issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September this year</TIMEX> because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> fell on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> .
     Revenues were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99.23 billion</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 97.74 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .

     Accrued interest on the refund was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 18 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as of Oct. 25</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck International Inc.</ENAMEX> 's agreement to acquire <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui Electric Co.</ENAMEX> proves that foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- if the alternative for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is extinction .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> , a fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15.6 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110 million</NUMEX> -RRB- for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 million</NUMEX> new shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> , a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , eager to rebut foreign criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> can make similar investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asil Nadir</ENAMEX> , echoed the official <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> view of the accord , which was announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     `` The myths that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is not open to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> from outside has , I think , been demolished at a stroke , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> said .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> is a special case .
     It expects to post a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.4 billion yen</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ending tomorrow</TIMEX> and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 13.8 billion yen</NUMEX> . ``
     If you find sound , healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , they are not for sale , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Watanabe</ENAMEX> , a management-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asia Advisory Services Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Statistics on acquisitions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> vary in detail , because unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> , which is listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Osaka</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> , most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> are privately held .
     But by all accounts foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have bought only a relative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">handful</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have acquired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Nor do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases .
     If the strong yen and the high stock prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and fiercely independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> corporate attitudes repel most would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">acquirers</ENAMEX> .
     Usually when a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest hour</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> was once <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's premier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiophiles</ENAMEX> .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , the market has moved toward less expensive `` mini-component '' sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other .
     Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's fellow audio-specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aiwa Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pioneer Electric Corp.</ENAMEX> , responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .
     As the yen soared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> lacked the money to build new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> .
     `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has not been able to cope very effectively with '' changes in the marketplace , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryosuke Ito</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     But even a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , some management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> maintain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshihisa Murasawa</ENAMEX> , a management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton -LRB- Japan -RRB- Inc.</ENAMEX> , said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> will likely be recommending acquisitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> more often to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> in the future .
     `` Attitudes -LCB- toward being acquired -RCB- are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murasawa</ENAMEX> said .
     `` In some industries , like pharmaceuticals , acquisitions make sense . ''
     Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen , but at the news conference , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> around .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> , he said , is a perfect fit for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> 's electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an `` original equipment maker '' basis for sale under other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' brand names .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> will greatly expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's product line , using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> to design the new products , and will move <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> .
     `` Whatever capital it -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> -RRB- needs so it can compete and become a totally global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entity</ENAMEX> capable of competing with the best in the world , that capital will be injected , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> said .
     And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> , it is bringing in a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> as executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> .
     Such risk taking is an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">everyday</TIMEX> matter for the brash Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> , who is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> as well as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> .
     He took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> , once a small fabric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">wholesaler</ENAMEX> , and used it at as a base to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> that has been doubling its profits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> foods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 557 million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 878 million</NUMEX> -RRB- .

     The bolstered cellular agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> , the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , the amended pact shows how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> 's persistence has pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> into a corner , forcing huge debt on the proposed new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The debt , estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.7 billion</NUMEX> , could mortgage the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's future earning power in order to placate some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> in the short term .
     The plan still calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> to combine its cellular telephone properties with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations .
     But under new terms of the agreement , announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> would receive a special cash dividend of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42</NUMEX> a share , representing a payout of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.23 billion</NUMEX> , shortly before the proposed merger .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend , but commitments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> still have n't been obtained .
     Under previous terms , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> would have received a dividend of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 20</NUMEX> a share .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> would exercise its right to buy out for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> equity interest of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metromedia Co.</ENAMEX> , in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> .
     That money also would have to be borrowed .
     In effect , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> has forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's hand by bidding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> for the stake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> .
     `` We 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to , '' acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Plouf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> .
     Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt , he estimated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would n't be profitable until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> or later .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analyst</ENAMEX> estimate the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> proposal at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 115 to $ 125</NUMEX> a share .
     They value <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> 's bid at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 112 to $ 118</NUMEX> a share .
     The previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> pact was valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 98 to $ 110</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> , the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">provider</ENAMEX> of cellular telephone service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , already owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.4 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> 's amended pact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kirkland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> extended its own offer to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125</NUMEX> apiece , which would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.3 %</NUMEX> controlling interest .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> continued to call for an auction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said they expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> to escalate the bidding again .
     `` This game is n't over yet , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel D. Gross</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp</ENAMEX> .
     `` At some point , it will become non-economical for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But I do n't think we 're at that point yet . ''
     Under its revised proposal , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> would have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> interest in the new cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and would be responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of its debt .
     To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> added a provision designed to give extra protection to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> if the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The provision , described as `` back-end '' protection , would require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> to pay a price equivalent to what an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> might have to pay .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> 's bid also has a similar clause .
     Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> 's proposal requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to begin an auction process in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1994</TIMEX> for remaining shares at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-party prices .
     To mollify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> concerned about the long-term value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> also agreed to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 10</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 540 million</NUMEX> , if , after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> , the trading value of the new cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is n't as high as the value that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> would have realized from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> offer .
     `` We 're very pleased with the new deal .
     We did n't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> to be so responsive , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick A. Moran</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moran Asset Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , which holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> 's `` back-end protection was flawed previously .
     We think this is a superior deal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> 's .
     We 're surprised .
     We did n't think a sleeping -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> -RCB- mentality would be willing to take on dilution . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Leon</ENAMEX> , a telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , finds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> proposal still flawed because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't have to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> to begin buying more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares .
     `` How many shares will be around in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> ? '' he asked .
     `` There 's nothing preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> from buying up shares in the meanwhile . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> 's revised proposal surprised many industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , especially because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O. McCoy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , said the revised agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> would dilute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> earnings by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">both 1990 and 1991</TIMEX> and by significantly less thereafter .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> 's cellular operations were among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> to become profitable .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.51</NUMEX> a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.6 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> were predicting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> earnings in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.90</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> , but now those estimates are being scaled back .
     In composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52.125</NUMEX> .
     In national over-the-counter trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares soared <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.625</NUMEX> to closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 112.625</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.50</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37.75</NUMEX> .
     The proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , including the newly acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metromedia</ENAMEX> stake , would give the new entity <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 million</NUMEX> potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35 million</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> markets .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> , in an attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Greene</ENAMEX> , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">system</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement .
     Urging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> to conduct `` a fair auction on a level playing field , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> asked how well the public interest would be served `` with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> controlling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 94 %</NUMEX> of all cellular -LCB- potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> -RCB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> markets .

     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading .
     Their motivation , however , has a strong practical aspect : Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks .
     The most controversial form of program trading , stock-index arbitrage , is `` making it tough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to make money , '' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Antolini</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</ENAMEX> .
     Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> stocks included in Standard &amp; Poor 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index .
     The S&amp;P 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies .
     The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading is n't known , as it is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , where it amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 13 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Estimates from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> put it at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 133 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Other market-maker gripes : Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market .
     Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves , a condition known as illiquidity .
     Moreover , the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> back to an OTC market that sorely misses them .
     Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market .
     But the big , often tumultuous slide in stock prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of retail equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were pleased to see stock prices rising .
     `` We were n't as concerned until they became sell programs , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> , who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman</ENAMEX> , however , executes program trades for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> , in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> , do program-trade OTC stocks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> say they do so only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , however .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> does program trading for its own as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ' accounts .
     Of course , there were sell programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">past years</TIMEX> , too , but they seem to hurt market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> more painfully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , when individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fled the market and trading activity dwindled .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> , to cut costs , slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> when other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are n't selling .
     And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> when no one else will .
     In such an environment , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> can suffer huge losses both on trades made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares .
     `` It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antolini</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> .
     But this skittishness , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antolini</ENAMEX> says , is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks .
     `` It 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> do n't want to -LCB- take the orders -RCB- .
     No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hardiman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX> , which oversees trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> , agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     But , he observes , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> suffer losses when program trading drags the market down , they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher .
     `` Sometimes -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> -RCB- lose sight of that , '' he says .
     The OTC stocks in the S&amp;P 500 include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's biggest , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Liz Claiborne</ENAMEX> .
     These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index .
     When the computers say `` sell , '' the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     The problem , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> say , is that while the industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in , the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Eight trading days after Oct. 12</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> before the stock market plunge , for instance , the Nasdaq Composite had fallen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> for the S&amp;P 500 , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</NUMEX> for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6 %</NUMEX> for the industrial average .
     This gap eventually closes , but slowly .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three days later</TIMEX> , as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's close , the Nasdaq Composite was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.9 %</NUMEX> for the industrial average , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.7 %</NUMEX> for the S&amp;P 500 and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8 %</NUMEX> for the Big Board Composite .
     The main reason for this lag is that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of the OTC market 's capitalization , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardiman</ENAMEX> , much more than on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> tend to be more cautious than institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> say .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.39</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">452.76</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , the index dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</NUMEX> .
     Weakness in big technology stocks hurt the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.43</NUMEX> , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">437.68</NUMEX> .
     The Nasdaq Financial Index lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.95</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">448.80</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's trading volume totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132.8 million</NUMEX> shares .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> share turnover for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 148 million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112 5\/8</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> from tendering their shares to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> , which dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 3\/4</NUMEX> , has offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125</NUMEX> a share for a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's shares .
     The revised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> promises to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> now plans to dole out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42</NUMEX> a share in cash , up from the earlier <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX> amount .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> eased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 7\/8</NUMEX> .
     The semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said the interruption in shipment of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486</ENAMEX> computer chip will be brief and have little impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's earnings .
     The stock fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> amid concerns over problems discovered with the chip .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will resume shipments of the chips within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two to three weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weisfield 's</ENAMEX> rocketed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> after the jewelry store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> said it is in preliminary discussions , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> it would n't identify , regarding the possible acquisition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Starpointe Savings Bank</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dime Savings Bank of New York</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21</NUMEX>-a-share acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Starpointe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kirschner Medical</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings will probably be lower than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 cents</NUMEX> a share it reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , despite a rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's revenue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kirschner</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 376,000</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.5 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 quarter</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline , including softer sales of joint-implants .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the turnover , largely confined to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index stocks , partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-week</TIMEX> trading account and the start of a new account .
     But they said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> economy and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's currency in the wake of the upheaval in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cabinet</ENAMEX> .
     A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warburg Securities</ENAMEX> noted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Gas</ENAMEX> , the most active blue-chip stock at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 million</NUMEX> shares traded , was affected by the political implications of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's departure and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cabinet</ENAMEX> shuffle .
     He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> may be in turmoil and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor Party</ENAMEX> positioned to regain control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and renew efforts at nationalization .

     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> , had only been in the job <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the multinational oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to switch into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Trading &amp; Transport</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell</ENAMEX> eased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416</NUMEX> on turnover of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8 million</NUMEX> shares .

     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , stocks closed lower but above <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">intraday</TIMEX> lows in active trading .
     The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> and fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151.20</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35527.29</NUMEX> .
     In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , the Nikkei index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148.85</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35378.44</NUMEX> .

     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-section volume was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3 billion</NUMEX> shares , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">886 million</NUMEX> shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wako Securities</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokerages</ENAMEX> ' excessive expectations about recent advances in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu Group</ENAMEX> shares and real estate issues were dashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Dealers</ENAMEX> placed heavy buy orders in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> to start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first trading day</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> transactions .
     But they failed to sell these stocks to client <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wako</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     Fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's profittaking was a natural result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> 's `` abnormal fever '' in buying real estate , shipbuilding , steel and construction shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> prices closed lower again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five days</TIMEX> and the culmination of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> that saw the DAX index lose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> .
     The DAX dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.69</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1462.93</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London</ENAMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> resignation , were responsible .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the DAX dropped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> more on a lack of any substantial buying interest .
     They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> had chosen to square positions ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentin Von Korff</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> .
     `` If you take away the outside influences , the market itself looks very cheap .
     What 's happening here is n't justified by the fundamentals . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     That 's leaving small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> with cold feet , they said , and prompting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well , at least until the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> settles down somewhat .
     Elsewhere , share prices closed lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> , and were mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> shakeup was widely cited for the declines .
     Share prices also closed lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sydney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Taipei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> .
     Concern about declines in other markets , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , caused selling pressure .
     Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> .
     To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1969</TIMEX> equaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> .

     That acquisition , to be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> , will include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cover Girl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Clarion</ENAMEX> makeup lines , making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketer</ENAMEX> of cosmetics in mass-market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> .
     It 's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> doing the acquiring : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> bring with them great experience with mundane products like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soap</ENAMEX> and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear .
     Though it is far from certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> best known for selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Promise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">margarine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Tide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> will succeed in cosmetics , there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry .
     For now , both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are keeping quiet about their specific plans .
     But industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing .
     But some cosmetics-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Estee Lauder Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revlon Inc.</ENAMEX> and other cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> traditionally have considered themselves fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     Cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> roll out new makeup colors several times a year , and since most products can be easily copied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> , they 're loath to test them with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it does n't mean they are packaged goods , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Lauder</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX> .
     `` They 're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars . ''
     In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> are the habitats of organization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in gray-flannel suits .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> that rely on extensive market research .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing .
     Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soaps</ENAMEX> and diapers -- to the extent that some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business .
     Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Oil of Olay</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> acquired as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Richardson-Vicks International</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     The moisturizer , introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1962</TIMEX> , had a dowdy image .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Oil of Olay</ENAMEX> brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had already aged , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Williams</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New England Consulting Group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin .
     It also redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Oil of Olay</ENAMEX> 's packaging , stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to one featuring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">mid-30s</TIMEX> vowing `` not to grow old gracefully . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> says sales have soared .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Goliaths</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> have enormous financial advantages over smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> plans to roll out a perfume called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Navy</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George L. Bunting Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> .
     Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's backing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> might not have been able to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the estimated $ 5 million to $ 7 million</NUMEX> needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands .
     Packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> `` will make it tougher for smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to remain competitive , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunting</ENAMEX> says .
     Further consolidations in the industry could follow .
     Rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> is interested in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schering-Plough Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> are widespread .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> wo n't comment ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schering</ENAMEX> , however , denies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brand</ENAMEX> is for sale .
     The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics .
     While the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are among the world 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads .
     Instead , they focus on events in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX> , for example , spends <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only an estimated 5 %</NUMEX> of sales on advertising in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX> says he has no plans to change his strategy .
     The most dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new-product development .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Nearly 70 %</NUMEX> of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> such as drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supermarkets</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Shore</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     That figure has been inching up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> .
     As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This fall</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L'Oreal Group</ENAMEX> , ordinarily a high-end line , rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Plenitude</ENAMEX> , which retail for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 to $ 15</NUMEX> .
     The packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> may try filling that gap with a spate of new products .
     Unlike the old-line cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition .
     Sales of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Tide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> soared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , for example , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> introduced a version that includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bleach</ENAMEX> safe for all colors and fabrics .
     That 's led industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands .
     `` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Peyrelongue</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cosmair Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">licensee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L'Oreal</ENAMEX> .
     `` You 'll see fewer gimmicks . ''
     But success for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX> acquired cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> say only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX> , which makes the mass-market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX> , has maintained a meaningful business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> , which acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helena Rubenstein</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> , sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brand</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven years later</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brand</ENAMEX> languished .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> already has experienced some disappointment .
     The mass-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Aziza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">brand</ENAMEX> , which it acquired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chesebrough-Pond 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , has lost share , according to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> is concentrating its efforts , may prove even more treacherous .
     In this niche , makeup colors change <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonally</TIMEX> because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions .
     Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned , careful training of store sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> by cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> is important .
     And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15</NUMEX> for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have yet to demonstrate on their own .

     There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> over how this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> conducts secret intelligence operations abroad .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of mistrust born of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Watergate</ENAMEX> , past misdeeds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> scandal , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities .
     If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has agreed to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
     That was n't always the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> handled such matters .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has pledged as well to respect the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">14-year-old</TIMEX> executive order barring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> from assassinating foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> or helping others to do so .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> never fully trusted former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">National Security Adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Poindexter</ENAMEX> to honor the ban .
     Despite objections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also has agreed to the establishment of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> who would be independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     In return , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> to inform it within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of the launching of any covert activity .
     It also has removed a ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> did n't get back in the assassination game .
     `` We 've finally been able to convince them that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> and -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver -RCB- North</ENAMEX> do n't work here anymore , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     The new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .
     It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> 's failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> support for such coups difficult .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> even disclosed privately that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">era</TIMEX> deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> required him to notify the odious <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> also hinted he might veto <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Okla .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- , for their part , angrily accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> for the bungled attempt to topple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities .
     Instead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> made it clear they respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and the moderate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> to iron out their differences .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> responded in kind .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> happily told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> had given Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said the relationship has reverted to its pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> character .
     There still are some details to be nailed down .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> does n't recognize .
     And a pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled .
     Moreover , both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">sides</ENAMEX> may face political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">conservatives</ENAMEX> will accuse the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of promising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> too much .
     And they continue anonymously attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> for being too accommodating to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , some congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> will accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> of wimping out , and they will warn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> harbors and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> sales .
     But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> could be entering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an era</TIMEX> when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards , while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> will balk .

     The market 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday-the-13th</TIMEX> plunge of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , program trading accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a record 13.8 %</NUMEX> of average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> , for example , said he wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> about program trading after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what I get back is gobbledygook . ''
     He said he 's upset that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , trying to calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> after the plunge , said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> `` is partly to blame -LCB- for the price swings -RCB- , because they 're <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">cowards</ENAMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> .
     `` Their powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">members</ENAMEX> manage them . ''
     The focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage , which accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the program trading that goes on .
     Index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Grasso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> said only that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is concerned about all its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">constituents</ENAMEX> .
     Privately , exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in trading will simply migrate to overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's .
     It is partly for this reason that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product that allows big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to buy or sell all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's index in a single trade .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> of the new basket product is index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> have complained for some time about program trading , particularly index arbitrage , to little avail .
     But according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , an organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">campaign</ENAMEX> from exchange-listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> might make the exchange finally consider big changes .
     `` They wo n't fight the listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Now the assault is on , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> ca n't ban stock-index futures , of course , but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to back off .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> put a bit of a damper on program trading when , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , it simply started to publish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> statistics of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's program-trading volume .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> is n't ready to go public yet with its effort , and that he does n't plan to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> once it is public .
     However , he said he planned to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> making calls to gather additional support .
     Among those Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said he has been talking to are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Weill</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Primerica Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GTE Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Johnson</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand Araskog</ENAMEX> .
     None of these chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> were available for comment .
     Among the targets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel</ENAMEX> 's part , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a month ago</TIMEX> informed each of its money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     It was just those kinds of ultimatums that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> unit said it cut off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> , which is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-biggest program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> on Wall Street , quickly announced pull-backs from index arbitrage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stand by their aggressive use of program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Executive Officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> said that despite the outcry even by some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , he believes index arbitrage does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole .
     '' However , pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> , could change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's policy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Welch</ENAMEX> has been `` besieged with phone calls '' complaining about his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's program trading , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> close to him .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is to promise business as usual .
     That may be the last thing she needs .
     As the air clears from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's storm of resignations and reshufflings , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> and her new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor of the exchequer</ENAMEX> , the untested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> , need to haul the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has to come to terms with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> economic integration , beginning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> is committed to joining fully someday .
     Finally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has to convince a rattled financial community -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> -- it is proceeding coherently toward its goals .
     It sounds like the work of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> , but the deadline is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1991</TIMEX> , when Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> is expected to call another national election .
     What 's worrying her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable .
     She could end up seeking a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit .
     Though Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has pulled through other crises , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> wonder if her steely , autocratic ways are the right formula <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     `` There 's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's style of management has become a political liability , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Martin</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> 's insistence on keeping a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coterie</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> -- including an economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> who openly criticized former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> -- confused the financial community .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , the strategy of playing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> off each other blew up : Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> quit in exasperation and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , announced his resignation within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> .
     The confusion could be costly .
     Currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , suspecting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> currency sharply lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> against the dollar and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> mark .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> expect further jitters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     A continuing slide in the pound could force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to push through another rise in the base rate , currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> .
     That could shove a weak economy into recession .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> have been anticipating a slump for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's economy `` is developing rapidly toward no-growth , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Paul Horne</ENAMEX> , international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> .
     A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1991</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> say , while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     Recovery could be hampered if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's major trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , which are enjoying robust economic activity , cool off as expected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1990</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     That would leave Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> little room for maneuver .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Tories</ENAMEX> to win the next election , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will need to sense economic improvement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a year</TIMEX> beforehand .
     Though Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> does n't need to call an election until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1992</TIMEX> , she would prefer doing so in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1991</TIMEX> .
     `` If the economy shows no sign of turning around in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about year</TIMEX> 's time , she will be very vulnerable , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barnes</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">London School of Economics</ENAMEX> .
     There 's an equally pressing deadline for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> .
     It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> , which links the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> currencies .
     At a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> summit , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> appeared to ease her opposition to full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> membership , saying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> would join once its inflation rate fell and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> liberalized capital movements .
     Since then , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has left <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> wondering if it ever meant to join .
     Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> .
     That produced little reaction from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> , reinforcing speculation the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would use its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions as a pretext for avoiding full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> membership .
     Despite the departure of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> , the tug-of-war over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> could continue .
     Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Howe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy prime minister</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership .
     Of immediate concern is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will continue Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> and responding in kind when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> move interest rates .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> `` does n't like taking orders from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Congdon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gerrard &amp; National Holding PLC .</ENAMEX>
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservatives</ENAMEX> rally around Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> during the crisis , many harbor hopes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's debacle will prompt change .
     `` We wo n't have any more of this wayward behavior , '' says Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hordern</ENAMEX> , a backbench <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> is fed up with sackings of good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     It 's an unrealistic expectation .
     As long as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> declared she did n't want debate in her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cabinet</ENAMEX> ; she wanted strong government .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , she said she did n't intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian .
     `` Nonsense , '' she told an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Weekend Television</ENAMEX> .

     WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">HUSBANDS</ENAMEX> take on more housework , they tend to substitute for chores done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> rather than by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rand Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Waite</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances Goldscheider</ENAMEX> analyzed a large sample of married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">between the ages of six and 18</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> indicated which family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did .
     Not unexpectedly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</NUMEX> of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of housecleaning , washing dishes , child care and family paper work .
     Only for yardwork and home maintenance did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's household tasks eased the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> 's burden appreciably , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> 's helping hand `` appears to lighten the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's load almost on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> basis and to reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> 's responsibility only modestly . ''
     This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> .
     In these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> took on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> more chores than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> with only grammar school education .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with highly educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> did <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</NUMEX> less housework than those in less-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     `` It is clear , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waite</ENAMEX> says , `` that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> .

     Conventional wisdom has long held that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere from one-fourth to one-half</NUMEX> of all elderly long-term care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> assistance .
     But separate reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Weiner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denise Spence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Brookings Institution</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korbin Liu</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Urban Institute</ENAMEX> find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10 %</NUMEX> -- of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> start out as private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payers</ENAMEX> but `` spend down '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
     -LRB- Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> are already on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> when they enter the nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> , a considerably higher proportion than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> anticipated . -RRB-
     But a remarkably high percentage -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> -- are private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payers</ENAMEX> throughout their stay , even a fairly lengthy one .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one-third</NUMEX> pay out of their own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> , private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Veterans Administration</ENAMEX> .
     Both reports are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> sampled in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> nationwide government survey .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Brookings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Urban Institute</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> caution , however , that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration , and reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays .
     Moreover , they note , those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> , using up life savings or drawing heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> Era <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young</ENAMEX> Hold Liberal Views
     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">REAGAN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reaching political maturity during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> 's presidency -- are firmly liberal on race and gender , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">NORC</ENAMEX> , the social science research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Many political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have speculated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> would produce a staunchly conservative younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">NORC</ENAMEX> 's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> indeed somewhat more pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> and pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> .
     But , says chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Smith</ENAMEX> , this `` does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues . ''
     Answers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> questions in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> national surveys reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the 18 to 24 age bracket</TIMEX> are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the 18 to 24 year olds</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">NORC</ENAMEX> 's polling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX> .
     They were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1986 through 1989</TIMEX> surveys .
     For example , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 %</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18 to 24 year olds</TIMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> latest surveys favored an `` open housing '' law prohibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     That compares with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 %</NUMEX> of the similar age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1980 through 1982</TIMEX> surveys and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1972 through 1975</TIMEX> surveys .
     Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are emotionally better suited to politics than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> disagreed , compared with under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an edgy month</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> of glasnost , the official <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> policy of allowing more candor from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's media .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstars</ENAMEX> of glasnost , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitaly Korotich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the trail-blazing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">weekly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday , Oct. 20</TIMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a somersaulting day</TIMEX> that turned from tension to elation .
     He had been summoned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Central Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> , after he finished his lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Savoy Hotel</ENAMEX> , an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating : <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">Eight-foot</NUMEX>-tall Rubenesquely naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cherubs</ENAMEX> , all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef</ENAMEX> 's trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> .
     Why had Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> been called ?
     `` I told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> , '' he said , `` that he was taking my butt to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Central Committee</ENAMEX> so they can ... '' whack , whack , whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm . ``
     They feel the need from time to time to ` educate ' me . ''
     And indeed , as he later reported , that was the import of the meeting .
     Anxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> are cautioning media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to take it easy , to be careful not to do anything that could be used by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is nervous .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> , who was present , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's publicized tongue-lashing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> was more of a plea : `` Be careful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> ; use good judgment .
     We 're standing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> , so do n't smoke ! ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> confirm Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> 's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger .
     In fact , a very high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> told an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The day</TIMEX> after that conversation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> , the Brezhnevite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pravda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Afnasjev</ENAMEX> , was replaced by a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's .
     Brezhnevite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holdovers</ENAMEX> have more to fear from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> than the verbal spanking he gave to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the very week</TIMEX> in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> was called to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Central Committee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> , a plurality , believed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's economic reforms , perestroika , would result in only insignificant change .
     A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journals</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> is circulation .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> took it over in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , it sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> copies ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> it sells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pravda</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , has retained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 57 %</NUMEX> of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> .
     Glasnost has made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> .
     Prevented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> from getting on its slate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX> for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> , he stood as an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> from his native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ukraine</ENAMEX> and won with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 %</NUMEX> of the vote .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The same evening</TIMEX> that he was summoned for a warning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Party</ENAMEX> , he was cheered by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> at a rally of what can only be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are , there is a fragility to glasnost .
     Censorship is n't a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX> invention .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czars</ENAMEX> were no civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">As late as the 1890s</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> prevented any coverage of famines .
     It even directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> .
     So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> society .
     It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> blink of history .
     It is public relations of the highest sophistication , that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point .
     What is that point ?
     Will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika ?
     `` I 'd be destroying myself , '' replies Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> , who then asks , `` What would that accomplish ?
     '' His answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture .
     It is the line beyond which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> can report not only on the bankruptcy of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> but on the failures of even admirable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies .
     They claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> would <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt .
     But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> that has changed .
     A supremely cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> is forever blinking yellow .
     Indeed , his caution has become legendary within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of ways , probing for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in search of potential problems .
     After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small .
     Such caution was evident after the recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday-the-13th</TIMEX> stock market plunge .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> urged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets .
     But he refused , claiming that he wanted to see what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> before making any public statement .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's ranks .
     A `` senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> '' spoke on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> after the market swoon to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed .
     The statement angered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> , but it was greeted with applause by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and the financial markets .
     And , while the mutinous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> has n't gone public , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> , most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Johnson</ENAMEX> , are known to have disagreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's decision to remain silent .
     Ironically , the anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> , who is mistakenly seen as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> .
     At a hearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's '' announcement over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the Oct. 13 weekend</TIMEX> was a `` very important statement . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's caution was apparent again on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> after the market 's plunge , when the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> took only modest steps to aid the markets .
     A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system .
     And , by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of that week</TIMEX> , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> , had settled at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.75 %</NUMEX> , barely changed from the level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 9 %</NUMEX> that prevailed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> appear increasingly concerned that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> is cautious to a fault .
     Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> is so grudging in reducing rates .
     Those concerns are n't expressed in public .
     In fact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> have been going out of their way in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two weeks</TIMEX> to dispel any impression that they are at odds , fearing stories about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> split added to the stock market 's jitters .
     Still , the split is there .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's concerns are understandable .
     The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> .
     Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last two years</TIMEX> , seem to have stalled .
     Factory payrolls and production fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> remains reluctant to loosen policy , partly because he faces a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phalanx</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> of regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> who oppose credit easing .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> has a wary eye aimed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> .
     Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4.5 %</NUMEX> .
     But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> eases too soon , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> fears , prices may begin to accelerate again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> holds tight , it may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-inflation goal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> embraced in testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     So far , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> well .
     His hand on the monetary tiller seems <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why the economy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> seems highly likely to begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an unprecedented eighth year</TIMEX> of peacetime growth without a recession .
     `` We 've gotten through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hale</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think you have to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> a good rating . ''
     But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     If that happens , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> could well become an open target .
     Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is toying with legislation to curb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's independence .
     If the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum .
