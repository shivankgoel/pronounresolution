     Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , due for release <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , fail to show a substantial improvement from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's near-record deficits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX> 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Mansion House</ENAMEX> speech <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Thursday</TIMEX> .
     This has increased the risk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> being forced to increase base rates to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> from their current <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> level to defend the pound , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and foreign exchange market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     `` The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dillow</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> .
     `` If there is another bad trade number , there could be an awful lot of pressure , '' noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Briscoe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midland Montagu</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midland Bank PLC .</ENAMEX>
     Forecasts for the trade figures range widely , but few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 2 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.2 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- deficit in the current account reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> deficit and the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 2.2 billion</NUMEX> gap registered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> are topped only by the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 2.3 billion</NUMEX> deficit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1988</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanjay Joshi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baring Brothers & Co.</ENAMEX> , said there is no sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports .
     At the same time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows .
     He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.8 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillow</ENAMEX> said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports .
     Combined with at least some rebound in exports after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as # 1.3 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe </ENAMEX>, who also forecasts a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.3 billion</NUMEX> current account gap , warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo n't advance much because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions .
     Nevertheless , he noted , `` No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position '' in the pound .
     Meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded .
     In his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Mansion House</ENAMEX> speech , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> takes effect .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> base rates are at their highest level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years</TIMEX> .
     But consumer expenditure data released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> do n't suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> economy is slowing that quickly .
     The figures show that spending rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> and was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     This compares with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6 %</NUMEX> rise in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4 %</NUMEX> increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter of 1988</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillow</ENAMEX> said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises .
     Certainly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX> has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , he reminded his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary .
     And , they warn , any further drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .
     Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's promise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> trading it declined to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5890</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.9495 marks</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5940</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.9429 marks</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> suggested that if the pound falls much below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.90 marks</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will be forced to increase rates to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated .
     Foreign exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points .
     Currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> predict that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming week</TIMEX> the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> .
     Late in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">trading day</TIMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8578 marks</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8470 marks</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .

     Freight rates , declining for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation .
     Trucking , shipping and air-freight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have announced rate increases , scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport .
     Major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> .
     That 's a big change from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> when freight haulage was a bright spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry more competitive abroad .
     `` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Sayre</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of logistics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont Co</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Shippers</ENAMEX> surveyed recently by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Ohio State University</ENAMEX> said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">past years</TIMEX> .
     `` This is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> since transportation deregulation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard LaLonde</ENAMEX> , a transportation logistics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Ohio State</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbus</ENAMEX> .
     The deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">railroads</ENAMEX> and trucking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> to bargain for transportation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Carriers</ENAMEX> could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Shippers</ENAMEX> cut <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 35 billion</NUMEX> from their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> , inter-city truck and rail costs , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 150 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.4 %</NUMEX> of gross national product , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> of GNP in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Shippers</ENAMEX> are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaLonde</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Shippers</ENAMEX> wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last eight or nine years</TIMEX> .
     Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Delaney</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur D. Little Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions .
     Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
     You 'll see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . ''
     Not everyone believes that the good times are over for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> .
     `` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard McCullough</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX> in transportation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
     Less-than-truckload <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which carry the freight of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> in each truck <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trailer</ENAMEX> , discounted away a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> rate increase implemented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> were competing fiercely for market share .
     Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Consolidated Freightways Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Menlo Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , less-than-truckload <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Consolidated Freightways</ENAMEX> plans to raise its rates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late this year</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> have announced similar increases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Truckers</ENAMEX> are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lloyd</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Bros .</ENAMEX>
     And `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> are getting the feeling that they have played <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trucker</ENAMEX> off against another as much as they can , '' he said .
     Air-freight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> raised their rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> products going across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> said it plans to boost its rates a further <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next two years</TIMEX> .
     Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> products and slow down the rate of increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Connors </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A.

     The only extra <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were a couple of personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , one of whom knew Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> the full picture .
     Over a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> told his story .
     He talked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 20 minutes</TIMEX> .
     When he was through , the court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> asked many questions , then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> said they would like to hear his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> 's side and talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> promised Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> a decision within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Stone</ENAMEX> is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
     It happened at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Management Appeals Committee</ENAMEX> , or just `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MAC</ENAMEX> , '' and it is likely to hear a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple of dozen</NUMEX> cases a year .
     Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Defense and Underseas Systems</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md.</ENAMEX> , or a number of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pioneers</ENAMEX> in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process .
     Although corporate due process is practiced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> in few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 60</NUMEX> -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming decade</TIMEX> a majority of people-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are likely to adopt it .
     Corporate due process appeals to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for a variety of reasons .
     It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-employees</ENAMEX> , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations .
     It helps to keep out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .
     It increases employee commitment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , with all that means for efficiency and quality control .
     What must your management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> do to establish corporate due process ?
     Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> key steps :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Make sure you have a strong personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> .
     It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> , else the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjudicators</ENAMEX> will be inundated with cases .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Personnel Policy Planning Committee</ENAMEX> may hear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 20</NUMEX> cases a year ; the rest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many hundreds</NUMEX> of complaints are resolved at earlier stages .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TWA </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">System Board of Adjustment</ENAMEX> hears <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 to 75</NUMEX> cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Problem Review Board</ENAMEX> may hear only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 or so</NUMEX> cases because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> 's skill in complaint-resolution .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a typical year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 20 %</NUMEX> of the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> goes to personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> with complaints of unfair treatment .
     In a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that means many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of complaints for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to handle .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Formally or informally , train all your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's due-process approach .
     See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">courts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjudicators</ENAMEX> .
     Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately .
     In case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> are unsuccessful and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> take their complaints to a company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjudicator</ENAMEX> , teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen .
     In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> I studied , reversal rates range on the average from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % to 40 %</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjudicator</ENAMEX> .
     A panel system like that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Stone</ENAMEX> example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panelists</ENAMEX> , mutual support .
     An adjudicator system -- that is , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> who acts <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> are among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> using the single-adjudicator approach .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . Make your due-process system visible .
     It wo n't do any good for anybody unless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> know about it .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managements</ENAMEX> hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cranks</ENAMEX> and chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soreheads</ENAMEX> to file complaints .
     On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith-Kline Beecham</ENAMEX> goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs .
     Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to support it .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> goes further in this respect than any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> I know of with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Barksdale</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> , respectively , sitting in on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Appeals Board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">almost every Tuesday</TIMEX> to decide cases .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Winchester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Justice on the Job : Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harvard Business School Press</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> -RRB- .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed higher in active trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , marking the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> gain since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's sharp fall .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> shares closed moderately lower in thin trading .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , the Nikkei index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> selected issues was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112.16</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35486.38</NUMEX> .
     The index advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">266.66</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , the Nikkei index rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101.98</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35588.36</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's volume on the First Section was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one billion</NUMEX> shares , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">862 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Winners</ENAMEX> outpaced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">losers</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">572</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">368</NUMEX> , while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">181</NUMEX> issues remained unchanged .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> relieved at the overnight gain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> , making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> believe the market was back to normal .
     The Nikkei , which reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 35611.38</NUMEX> right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the day</TIMEX> because of profit-taking .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , do n't want to hold a position over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dai-ichi Securities</ENAMEX> said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> session .
     The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.78</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.06</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.53 %</NUMEX> , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2679.72</NUMEX> .
     The Second Section index , which rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.72</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.88</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.32 %</NUMEX> , to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3717.46</NUMEX> .
     Volume in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 million</NUMEX> shares , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     In turmoil caused by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stocks , the Nikkei marked a sharp <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647.33</NUMEX>-point fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     But the Nikkei fell an overall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> in value <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> compared with Wall Street 's far sharper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> drop on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market 's resiliency helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> plunge and realized these problems were unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stocks and not directly related to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
     The Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1017.69</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four days</TIMEX> -- more than erasing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's losses .
     But further major advances on the Nikkei are n't foreseen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> by market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> are still waiting to see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be stabilized .
     Some high-priced issues made a comeback <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> surged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">450 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.16</NUMEX> -RRB- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,050 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42.60</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,440</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fanuc</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,580</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Breweries</ENAMEX> attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sapporo</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,920</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kirin</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,070</NUMEX> .
     Housings , constructions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> continued to be bought following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's gains because of strong earnings outlooks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa House</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,660</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Misawa Homes</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,960</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kajima</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,120</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohbayashi</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,730</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujisawa</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,010</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mochida</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,400</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> share prices were influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound .
     The key Financial Times-Stock Exchange <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2</NUMEX> points lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2179.1</NUMEX> , above its intraday low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2176.9</NUMEX> , but off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2189</NUMEX> .
     The index finished <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> under its close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2233.9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous Friday</TIMEX> , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early last week</TIMEX> on the back of Wall Street 's fall .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> was weak throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's trading , however , on what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> attributed to generally thin interest ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's potentially important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> trade figures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     The FT-SE <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> largely remained within an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-point range establshed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX> of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower .
     The FT <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-share index closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.0</NUMEX> points lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1761.0</NUMEX> .
     Volume was extremely thin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351.3 million</NUMEX> shares , the lightest volume of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> and modestly under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">387.4 million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     They added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">market-makers</ENAMEX> were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> shares .
     Interest may remain limited into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous two months</TIMEX> .
     The key corporate news of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said they viewed the initial <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 390-million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 622 million</NUMEX> -RRB- outlay for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> as a bit much .
     Its shares slid in late dealings to close <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX> per share lower at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">197 pence</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> was the most active FT-SE <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.2 million</NUMEX> shares traded .
     The next most active top-tier stock was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX> , the target of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13.4 billion</NUMEX> bid .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> gained shareholder approval <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to restructure in a bid to fend off the hostile takeover .
     Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> that his plans for the takeover had n't changed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">778</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> , on turnover of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5 million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-week</TIMEX> .
     In other active shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trusthouse Forte</ENAMEX> shed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">294</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4 million</NUMEX> shares after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barclays De Zoete Wedd</ENAMEX> downgrading , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hillsdown Holdings</ENAMEX> , a food products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , was boosted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX> after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases .
     Elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , share prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milan</ENAMEX> .
     Prices were lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> gold stocks closed moderately lower .
     Share prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sydney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Taipei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Singapore</ENAMEX> and were lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> .
     Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> .
     To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1969</TIMEX> equaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> .
     The percentage change is since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is required to notify foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictators</ENAMEX> if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives , government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> exchange of letters between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> .
     The existence of the guidelines has become known since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> disclosed them privately to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> meeting last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> familiar with the meeting said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> 's futile effort to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> even read to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> selections from a highly classified letter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> discussing the guidelines .
     They said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> coup effort .
     No notification was ever considered , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said , apparently because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> did n't think the coup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> intended to kill Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , but merely sought to imprison him .
     What 's more , both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> .
     The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and intelligence committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 12</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few days</TIMEX> before the meeting at which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> complained about the rules .
     However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> , is already being interpreted on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> as an unfair effort to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
     A statement issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> of the committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Okla.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     The statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branches</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Not only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> in the future .
     I 've invited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to send his suggestions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and other committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> by a meddling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , both congressional and administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> that were initiated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1988</TIMEX> and stretched into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last October</TIMEX> .
     The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> role in assassinations .
     In fact , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> were still differing on what had been agreed to .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said notification was required even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> 's life .
     But a congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> 's coup attempt , some administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> senior administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .
     The issue came to a head <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> recalled , partly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> coup efforts .
     In addition , both administration and congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign .
     Though the assassination ban is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> order that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> never voted on , the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> can exercise influence over its interpretation .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> publicly called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> more freedom to act in coups .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> for restrictions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> said have hampered its freedom of action .
     However , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster </ENAMEX>'s two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> 's role in the coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> appeared to have made some headway with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> after their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 12</TIMEX> meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> encouragement of coups against anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .
     The new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed .

     -LRB- During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past century</TIMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
     MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the Roaring Twenties</TIMEX> -LRB- they had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a century</TIMEX> -RRB- , but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> such funds .
     Besides creating a vehicle for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations .
     The idea was to let small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , the backbone of the fund business , deal in the money market 's high short-term interest rates .
     This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> decimal place .
     The now-standard price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> a share came about by accident .
     An early fund had filed a registration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> that included a fixed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> price .
     It arrived just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> handling such operations was retiring .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> approved the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> started the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> advertising-backed retail fund in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1974</TIMEX> , it was priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> a share -LRB- and reached <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in assets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one year</TIMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> moved to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> price after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> set standards -- an average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">120-day</TIMEX> maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule .
     Keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience .
     Actually , the funds do fluctuate , but beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> decimal place .
     Rounding-off keeps them at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> .
     Eventually , the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to offer competing yields .
     The new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> -LRB- there are more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 million</NUMEX> accounts -RRB- started with a money fund .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">470</NUMEX> money market funds have total assets exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 billion</NUMEX> .
     -LRB- The companion tax-exempt funds add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 billion</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> alone has seen its money market funds grow from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> to closes to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> issues its first reading on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> real gross national product <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation .
     The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</NUMEX> gain , down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS International</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     But inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's report , is expected to rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.5 %</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel D. Kahan</ENAMEX> , chief financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     `` If that gets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The week</TIMEX> 's other notable indicators include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> auto sales , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> durable goods orders as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate .
     Most are expected to fall below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous-month</TIMEX> levels .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession .
     In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recent natural disasters -- <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     The recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profits now being reported .
     `` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael K. Evans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Evans Economics Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     The economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa .
     On the other hand , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> GNP . ''
     His estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate .
     Demand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production .
     By and large , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> believe the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Campbell </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rune Andersson</ENAMEX> set out to revive flagging <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg AB</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , he spurned the advice of trendy management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> .
     `` All these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> recalls .
     Yet under its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">45-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strengthening its existing rubber and plastics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
     It was a gutsy move for a little-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , fired after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only two months</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of his previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> .
     Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX> quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us .
     If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> is anxious to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's balance sheet .
     Characteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> announced plans to spin off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> -- minerals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processing</ENAMEX> , and building and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distribution</ENAMEX> -- as separately quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stockholm 's Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> would add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 386 million</NUMEX> -RRB- to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's coffers , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> had also been expected to approve a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr1.5 billion</NUMEX> international offering of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> shares .
     But that share issue -- intended to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> better known among international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the situation say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr29</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.48</NUMEX> -RRB- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr205</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 31.65</NUMEX> -RRB- in volatile trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the shares regained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr20</NUMEX> , closing at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr225</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> says he is confident that taking parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's share price .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> plans to remain the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> with stakes of slightly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</NUMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">spinoff</ENAMEX> should solve a problem for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> .
     A family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">foundation</ENAMEX> set up by late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Dunker</ENAMEX> controls <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's voting shares outstanding .
     But the foundation bylaws require the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> stake to be sold in the open market if control drops <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</NUMEX> .
     That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's rapid growth steadily diluted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">foundation</ENAMEX> 's holding .
     That growth is the result of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years</TIMEX> .
     Most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AB Electrolux</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> and a handful of loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results .
     The treatment turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Between 1985 and 1988</TIMEX> , sales multipled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> , who owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , to be named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernst Herslow</ENAMEX> steps down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> describes as `` being the driving force leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to bring me ideas . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , in his boldest move yet , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> joined forces with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noranda Inc.</ENAMEX> in a joint <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> hostile takeover of another big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> suggest that the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> could vault <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> from a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> success <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">story</ENAMEX> to a world-class mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> is n't in the same league yet as mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTZ Corp.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anglo-American Corp.</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Kurtanjek</ENAMEX> , a mining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     `` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> still must clear some tough hurdles .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> acknowledges that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . ''
     Booming metals prices have fueled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> from a big loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years earlier</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> caution an expected fall in metal prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> could slow profit growth .
     Mining is likely to remain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's main business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> manages to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> each came close to winning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> alone before the successful joint bid .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> would prefer to break up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swedes</ENAMEX> -- relatively inexperienced in international mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> operating on its home turf .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> have n't discussed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> break-up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> , he says , will continue operating in its current form .
     `` We 'd be reluctant to accept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> ownership in a manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> says .
     Perhaps more important , both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> share Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
     `` If <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> of consumption , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'90s</TIMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the investment decade</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> says .
     `` The whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says .
     `` That 's beginning to change .
     And investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> is in .
