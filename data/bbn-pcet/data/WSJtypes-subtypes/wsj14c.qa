     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bakersfield Supermarket</ENAMEX> went out of business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May</TIMEX> .
     The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
     Nor was there a shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> in the area , the residential <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Inwood</ENAMEX> section of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> closed when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> was murdered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Ortiz</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">29-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his first year</TIMEX> of operating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> he bought for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220,000</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortiz</ENAMEX> was robbed at least twice at gunpoint .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time he was shot in the hand as he chased the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX> outside .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time he identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX> , who were arrested and charged .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two weeks later</TIMEX> -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortiz</ENAMEX> was shot <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in the back , during what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> classified as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> robbery attempt .
     That was his reward for working until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven days</TIMEX> a week to cover his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,000</NUMEX> a month rent .
     For providing what his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> described as very personal and helpful service .
     For creating a focus for neighborhood life .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Ortiz</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who will be injured or killed by crime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics</ENAMEX> reports that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 2 %</NUMEX> of all retail-sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> times the rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> , medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and door-to-door <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> .
     Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bartenders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> .
     Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
     Recent data from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> provide more of the picture .
     While by no means the highest crime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> is a prime example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> where crime strangles small-business development .
     A survey of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> there was conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this spring</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Interface</ENAMEX> , a policy research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> .
     It gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> a questionnaire and analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">353</NUMEX> responses .
     The survey found that over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three-year</TIMEX> period <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Seventeen percent</NUMEX> reported their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> being robbed .
     Crime was the reason that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> reported difficulty recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> said they were considering moving .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one-third</NUMEX> of the responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">premises</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Bronx</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> is burglarized each year .
     Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average .
     Crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two decades ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Reiss </ENAMEX>'s landmark study of crime against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> drawn from national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> records .
     He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> times higher for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> than for large ones .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> study 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ; their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> crime losses averaged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 15,000</NUMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 8,385</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> cost in security -- enough money to hire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> .
     The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> as the risk of personal injury .
     After repeated gun robberies , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> may give up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> out of fear for their lives .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> recently sold their liquor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">34 years</TIMEX> in business that included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> robbery deaths and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> robberies or burglaries on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">premises</ENAMEX> .
     These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James K. Stewart</ENAMEX> calls `` crime causing poverty . ''
     Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     Small neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     This may help explain why small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> create <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of all jobs nationally , but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 22 %</NUMEX> of jobs in a crime-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> study found that the cost of security measures in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 1,000</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> that amount for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     The shift of retailing to large shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments .
     Private security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> and moonlighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">places</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , in fact , revenues of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> largest guard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , primarily serving such big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , have increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 62 %</NUMEX> .
     Few small neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchants</ENAMEX> .
     In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> for protection .
     This creates several problems .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> is that there are not enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to satisfy small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     The number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> proposal for reducing crime in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> survey was to put more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 22 %</NUMEX> supported private security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrols</ENAMEX> funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> themselves .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> response they receive .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
     Another solution <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> losing business to suburban shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
     Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Justice</ENAMEX> support , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Crime Control Institute</ENAMEX> are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
     Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is scheduled to testify against a robbery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> .
     While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .
     It might even have saved the life , and business , of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Ortiz</ENAMEX> .

     Diversification pays .
     That 's a fundamental lesson for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday-the-13th</TIMEX> plunge .
     Stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week through last Thursday</TIMEX> , according to figures compiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical Services Inc</ENAMEX> .
     That reflects the huge drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week ago Friday</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Monday</TIMEX> 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed .
     But several other types of funds shielded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> from the worst of the market 's slide .
     Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds .
     `` More than ever , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should realize they should have a diversified portfolio , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Duffield</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard Group</ENAMEX> .
     `` That means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">One week</TIMEX> 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision .
     But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough .
     `` You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Brouwer</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brouwer & Janachowski</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's like kicking the tires of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> ... .
     What you want to know is when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> going to perform ? ''
     General equity funds fell an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.35 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Thursday</TIMEX> , compared with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.32 %</NUMEX> slide for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical</ENAMEX> 's figures show that there were a number of ways <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations .
     Gold-oriented funds , for instance , which invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that mine and process the precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">metal</ENAMEX> , posted an average decline of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.15 %</NUMEX> .
     Flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.27 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper</ENAMEX> .
     Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step further by investing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 25 %</NUMEX> of their portfolios outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods , like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> , when the dollar declines against other major currencies .
     With all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.07 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week through last Thursday</TIMEX> .
     But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price to pay : A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> notwithstanding , stocks have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's hot investment .
     Thus , even including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> , the average general stock fund has soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 24 %</NUMEX> so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical</ENAMEX> figures show .
     By comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 19 %</NUMEX> , while domestic flexible portfolios are up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 17 %</NUMEX> .
     Fixed-income funds have returned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.2 %</NUMEX> , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 4.55 %</NUMEX> , on average .
     `` That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brouwer</ENAMEX> .
     `` You do n't make any real money . ''
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last 20 years</TIMEX> , for example , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brouwer</ENAMEX> says , an investor putting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> a year in the S&P 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     Some equity funds did better than others in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week that began on Friday the 13th</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monetta Fund</ENAMEX> , for instance , was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> top performing fund for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.65 %</NUMEX> return .
     Its return so far this year has been a credible <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.71 %</NUMEX> .
     The fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> over its cost .
     By the time the market plummeted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 days ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monetta</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> in cash , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bacarella</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Monday</TIMEX> , he started `` buying the high-quality growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were throwing away at discount prices . ''
     Among Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacarella</ENAMEX> 's picks : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oracle Systems</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok International Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Microwave Corp</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> 's cash position is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 22 %</NUMEX> , which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacarella</ENAMEX> calls `` still bearish . ''
     Among the big stock funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreyfus Fund</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2 billion</NUMEX> in assets , had a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1.49 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> and a return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.42 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dreyfus Corp.</ENAMEX> , said the fund was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> invested in government bonds on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> in cash .
     `` In a downward market , bonds act better , '' he said .
     `` We still think there 's a lot of unsettlement in this market .
     We believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . ''
     Many of the funds that did best in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last week</TIMEX> are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak .
     From its high point on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday , Oct. 12</TIMEX> , to where it traded late in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week later</TIMEX> , the dollar fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6 %</NUMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> mark , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4 %</NUMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</NUMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> yen .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> International Cash Portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> top-performing funds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> .
     Because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar .
     But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the dollar value of these funds declines .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> funds posted negative returns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year to date</TIMEX> .
     Of the funds that fared the worst in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the post-Oct . 13 week</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led the market slide following problems with financing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp .</ENAMEX> buy-out plan .
     Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year to date</TIMEX> : <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.09 %</NUMEX> for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.24 %</NUMEX> for National Aviation & Technology .

     Noting that equity funds are up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 60 %</NUMEX> from their post-crash low on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 3 , 1987</TIMEX> , he said that what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> `` may not be enough of an adjustment .

     Sitting at the bar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Four Seasons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William McDonough</ENAMEX> seems oblivious to the glamorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> and the elegant setting .
     He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts .
     `` Look how much air is moving around ! '' he says .
     `` The ventilation here is great ! ''
     You may be hearing more about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">38-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> and his preoccupation with clean air .
     After years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glues</ENAMEX> , and avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">mahogany</ENAMEX> , which comes from endangered rain forests .
     He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quilted Giraffe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Progressive Architecture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> called it -- and his remodeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> .
     He has designed furniture and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> as well as commercial and office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">space</ENAMEX> .
     He is now designing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Broadway</ENAMEX> stage set for a show by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">band</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Kid Creole and the Coconuts</ENAMEX> .
     What really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture .
     Now the question is : Is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> ready for it ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet , the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Warsaw Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     The project has already acquired a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> cachet .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX> 's plans to sell a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">foot</NUMEX>-tall chocolate model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> .
     Some of the sales proceeds will go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Design Industries Foundation</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cake</ENAMEX> topped with a replica of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> will be auctioned at an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> benefit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough </ENAMEX>'s plans get executed , as much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> as possible will be made from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">aluminum</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glass</ENAMEX> recycled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw</ENAMEX> 's abundant rubble .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-story mesh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spire</ENAMEX> will stand atop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> stories of commercial space .
     Solar-powered batteries will make the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spire</ENAMEX> glow .
     The windows will open .
     The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes .
     To the extent that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> budget will allow it , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> will rely on solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">wood</ENAMEX> , rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plywood</ENAMEX> or particle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> , to limit the emission of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough</ENAMEX> has his way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> will compensate for the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> 's emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> fear .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> would plant a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">10-square-mile</NUMEX> forest somewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150,000</NUMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> footing the bill .
     The news has n't exactly moved others in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough </ENAMEX>'s profession to become architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Appleseeds</ENAMEX> .
     All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burgee</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is designing the redevelopment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Times Square</ENAMEX> , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme .

     He earned a master 's degree in architecture from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> .
     His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth .
     He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> still spend time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each summer</TIMEX> fly-fishing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iceland</ENAMEX> .
     Living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , power and water supplies .
     At his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolmates</ENAMEX> to take only brief showers .
     He and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Dartmouth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that restored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hydroelectric power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> , he designed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> solarheated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonough </ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> design for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">offices</ENAMEX> took <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">10,000 square feet</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">14-foot</NUMEX> ceilings and big , operable windows .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution .
     To reduce it at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> rubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">beeswax</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyurethane</ENAMEX> on the floors in the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Jute</ENAMEX> , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked-down carpets , and the desks are of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">wood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">granite</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastic</ENAMEX> .
     The budget was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 400,000</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Offices</ENAMEX> with outside windows have inside windows , too , to let in more real daylight .
     `` We proved a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> does n't cost more , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Krupp</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls .
     But , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 10 days</TIMEX> , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> should he become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> .
     Ordinarily , a clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's misfortunes .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> , a celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> , has had difficulty switching from his crime-busting , finger-pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big , troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> , at the crucial moment , he 's running out of money .
     This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> and , traditionally , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's best-known urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> hoped that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> could become a highly visible national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> figured that in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">territory</ENAMEX> and that they would pick up a new political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> .
     But it has n't worked out that way .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is a decent but sloppy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Garth</ENAMEX> , veteran campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> here who has always worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Koch</ENAMEX> , defeated by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 12</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> primary .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternative</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> -- is ghastly . ''
     `` I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wade</ENAMEX> , a politically active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> who supported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ravitch</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">also-ran</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> primary .
     `` There 's nothing on the other side . ''
     `` We 're picking up steam , '' insists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ailes</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> 's media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , whose last big campaign helped put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> .
     He adds : `` It just has n't gotten down to the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> yet . ''
     But the steam may never reach the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     For , just as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> latches on to an issue that has Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ailes</ENAMEX> 's commercials on the air beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     To help out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> is dispatching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Cabinet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady </ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Powers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating .
     Historically , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> is almost always in trouble .
     But the trouble it faces now under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     And hardly surprising , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> trying to cope with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's other problems are constantly on edge , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> scrapping with another .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were n't so happy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lessner</ENAMEX> , another local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> and the biographer of the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiorello LaGuardia</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> who built a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">coalition</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> hopes to emulate .
     `` But , at least , back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other . ''
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">62-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-Marine</ENAMEX> , has served as the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> and as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , a job with limited executive responsibilities
     -LRB- `` I defy you to come up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major accomplishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     He defeated the contentious Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's racial and ethnic wounds .
     His general-election campaign is almost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-like , all muted pictures and comforting words .
     His theme is unity , decency , humanity , bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> together again .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are negotiating about holding debates , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">45-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins </ENAMEX>.
     `` He 's got to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's negatives up , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Miringoff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Marist College Institute of Public Opinion</ENAMEX> .
     `` But our polls show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> do n't like the attack stuff .
     Why , even <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> vote is going to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` It 's assault-weapons politics , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Siegal</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's issues <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> effort .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> , it 's a conundrum .
     On the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> wants to cut into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's credibility .
     On the other , he seeks to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> he 's the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiorello LaGuardia</ENAMEX> -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> out of the mess it 's in .
     It has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Liberal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">parties</ENAMEX> -LRB- he won the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Liberal</ENAMEX> endorsement -RRB- and that he turned to comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> for help with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> left the campaign after telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is `` a fancy'<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shvartzer</ENAMEX> ' with a moustache . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shvartzer</ENAMEX> is a derogatory <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> word for a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble .
     He can match <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> with his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert `` Sonny '' Carson</ENAMEX> , an angry street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizer</ENAMEX> who was convicted of kidnapping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> campaign paid Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 10,000</NUMEX> to get out the vote on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">primary-election day</TIMEX> .
     Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> has been charged with being anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Semitic</ENAMEX> .
     Asked about that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the other day</TIMEX> , he replied , `` Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Semitic</ENAMEX> ?
     I 'm anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX> . ''
     More troubling for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is his record in personal accounting .
     It began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> , when he was being considered for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy mayor</ENAMEX> , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous four years</TIMEX> .
     `` I was always going to do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , '' he explained at the time .
     And now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inner City Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , headed by his old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy Sutton</ENAMEX> , to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins Jr.</ENAMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58,000</NUMEX> .
     He had valued the shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years earlier</TIMEX> .
     He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Estimate</ENAMEX> .
     He says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> has n't paid for the shares .
     `` It looks like serious tax evasion , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ailes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .
     `` It follows the same pattern as his tax returns .
     He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . ''
     `` He simply has n't explained why something worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million dollars</NUMEX> ended up worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years later</TIMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' value of the shares and their market value . ''
     So far though , no one -- not even former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has broken or just what tax he has evaded .
     `` The crime goes to character , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Maiorana</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">campaign</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's serious stuff .
     He evades and ducks .
     He 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . ''
     `` It makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think , maybe this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is n't so squeaky clean after all , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garth </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> 's media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> loss and slashed its dividend in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Forest City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">motor homes</ENAMEX> said it had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46 cents</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter ended Aug. 26</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year earlier</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had a deficit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six cents</NUMEX> a share .
     The cut in the dividend to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">semiannually</TIMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 cents</NUMEX> , `` would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Rolfes</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dain Bosworth Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The year</TIMEX> was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">motor homes</ENAMEX> , travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trailers</ENAMEX> , folding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">campers</ENAMEX> and van conversions .
     With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> 's robust sales .
     But the rate of the decline snowballed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , with unit sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.5 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Recreation Vehicle Industry Association</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> , sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 89.5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95.4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> attributed the decline to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key expenses for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">RV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Curran </ENAMEX>, who follows the industry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to defer purchases . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curran</ENAMEX> expects industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">RV</ENAMEX> sales for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> to fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , when sales of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">427,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> were the highest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> .
     And he said the weakness could continue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of next year</TIMEX> .
     But he said the industry has `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good decade ahead</TIMEX> , '' particularly if aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">RVs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> industrywide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first eight months of the year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it also suffered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> , among other things .
     The news sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> stock falling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62.5 cents</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.25</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading - a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> low .
     The dividend cut will prove most costly for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John K. Hanson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> .
     Based on his control of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 45 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.7 million</NUMEX> shares , his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> dividend income would be cut to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.2 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.4 million</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 cents</NUMEX> a share , following profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again .
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> is that the news will be negative .
     And that , they say , will be good for bonds . `` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Platt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of economic research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Platt</ENAMEX> is advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> will allow interest rates to move lower in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming weeks</TIMEX> .
     That would be comforting to fixed-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , many of whom were badly burned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> by incorrectly assuming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> would ease .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> rushed to buy bonds during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall .
     But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled .
     Long-term bonds have performed erratically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     For example , a group of long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> produced a total return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.45 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.06 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Total return is price changes plus interest income .
     Now some investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to buy bonds before the rally begins .
     Among other things , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">industries</ENAMEX> are depressed .
     At the same time , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating .
     Add it all up and it means `` that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Robertson</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mellon Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 1\/2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next two weeks</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> . ''
     The federal funds rate , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's credit policy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> generally agree that the rate was lowered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 9 %</NUMEX> , where it had been since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> on the heels of a weak employment report .
     Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , it ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 11\/16 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kochan</ENAMEX> , chief fixed-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall .
     `` Given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> should prove quite rewarding before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kochan</ENAMEX> also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
     He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities .
     `` If the -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> -RCB- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TVA</ENAMEX> , in its first public debt offering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> , sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> of long-term and intermediate-term securities <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     Strong investor demand prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> to boost the size of the issue from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TVA</ENAMEX> , which operates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest electric power systems , is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> owned by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     But persuading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to buy bonds may be especially tough <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will auction <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 30 billion</NUMEX> of new securities .
     Today , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> will sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.6 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills at the regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> auction .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> will sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Refcorp</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> of a new government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> created to bail out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's troubled savings and loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">associations</ENAMEX> , will hold its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bond auction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , when it will sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds .
     All of this comes ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> .
     So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have n't shown much appetite for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Refcorp</ENAMEX> 's initial bond offering .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Early</ENAMEX> , a portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated Investors Corp.</ENAMEX> , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention .
     `` Why should I bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? '' he said .
     `` I 'm not going to jump on them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first day</TIMEX> they come out . ''
     He seems to be typical of many professional money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> .
     When the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Refcorp</ENAMEX> offering was announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/20</NUMEX> percentage point more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the yield was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/4</NUMEX> percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> believe that yields on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities may rise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
     But once the new securities are digested , they expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to focus on the weak economic data .
     `` The supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Kahan </ENAMEX>, chief financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` If one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply is coming . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     Most bond prices fell on concerns about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline .
     Junk bond prices moved higher , however .
     In early trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> would continue .
     Also providing support to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks .
     Those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ended with losses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 1\/4</NUMEX> point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond , which traded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 102 1\/4</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 17\/32</NUMEX> .
     The yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.98 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.96 %</NUMEX> .
     In the corporate bond market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 475 million</NUMEX> junk bond offering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> said they expect to price a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> senior subordinated debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imo Industries Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> expect the issue to be priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> said that a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> senior subordinated discount debenture issue by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.P. Scherer Drugs</ENAMEX> is expected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> .
     However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are skeptical the deals will get done .

     `` If they had this much trouble with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> were forced to postpone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market .

     After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of negotiating that stretched late into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> priced the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.75 %</NUMEX> , higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.5 %</NUMEX> that had been expected .
     The coupon on the issue will be reset in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> at a rate that will give the issue a market value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> .
     However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.50 %</NUMEX> .
     Debenture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> also will receive the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the common stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> 's parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> on the fence to come in , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> .
     `` We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . ''

     That total was below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 140 million</NUMEX> the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> had made with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> proved profitable to the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four days</TIMEX> , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .

     The settlement stems from charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Better Book</ENAMEX> , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bureau</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">from 1984 to 1986</TIMEX> .
     Without admitting any guilt , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bureau</ENAMEX> agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> to publish its directories .
     The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businesspeople</ENAMEX> that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Better Book</ENAMEX> .

     Debates are due to be broadcast nationally starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 21</TIMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> experiment .
     A majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are said to be wary of making new loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> plan because they 're uncertain the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> economy will remain stable .
     Instead , many small and medium-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , and some larger ones , are likely to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> options open to them under the plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending .
     But an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at a long-term credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> explained that since some larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have already taken loss provisions for loans to other Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable .
     `` They ca n't take the hit '' to their earnings , he said .
     As a result , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-week</TIMEX> strike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Masillon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , bakeware <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> .
     Softer-than-expected orders in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> also played a role , he said in an interview .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the full year</TIMEX> will exceed the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     That would require <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than about 22 cents to 24 cents</NUMEX> a share , assuming that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein </ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> estimate proves accurate .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier fourth quarter</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> revenue is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million to $ 45 million</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.2 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Gordon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> periods do n't reflect results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woodstream Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , acquired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last January</TIMEX> , but include some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> that were sold at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1988</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">August through October</TIMEX> traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business , as many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> use the goods as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn</TIMEX> promotional items .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> but have been ordering more heavily in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woodstream</ENAMEX> is `` marginally profitable '' but has n't performed as well as expected .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woodstream</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Victor</ENAMEX>-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segment</ENAMEX> , wildlife traps , is suffering from a `` depressed market , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> is seeking to sell that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segment</ENAMEX> , he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said he expects profit to be higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekco Housewares</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1987</TIMEX> .
     -LRB- Prior to acquiring the housewares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Centronics Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Centronics</ENAMEX> had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of computer printers , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> decided to sell that business after <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> grabbed a dominant share of the market . -RRB-
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said tighter operating controls have enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> to reduce inventory levels <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 % to 30 %</NUMEX> ; improve on-time delivery of orders to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 70 %</NUMEX> ; and to lower the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">labor hours</TIMEX> required to produce a unit .
     By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said .
     In addition to those measures , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> spent heavily <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> to install displays at its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ' retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> -- a strategy that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     The main issue in the strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> was health-care benefits , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said .
     The strike ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said .
     He indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> may be interested in acquiring another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with revenue in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million to $ 100 million</NUMEX> , partly because mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchandisers</ENAMEX> increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers</ENAMEX> .

     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> of booming business with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are bracing for the biggest slump in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> .
     The imposition of austerity measures , starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last October</TIMEX> , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter .
     Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> and export-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> strapped for cash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Givaudan Far East Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> that sells <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> to shampoo and soap <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , typifies the problems .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sales flattened during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 's first half</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> killings magnified the problems .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Canton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Givaudan</ENAMEX> 's representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> received no orders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Lai</ENAMEX> became convinced that business would be bad for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many months</TIMEX> .
     `` Things have grown worse since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> says .
     He predicts that sales will drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30 % and 40 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million</NUMEX> .
     The consumer-products and light-industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sectors</ENAMEX> are bearing the brunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's austerity measures , and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Givaudan</ENAMEX> that deal with those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">industries</ENAMEX> are being hit the hardest .
     But in general , all foreign-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are feeling the pinch .
     `` The import pie will shrink , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kamm </ENAMEX>, first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">American Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> .
     `` On the down side , sales could fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 90 %</NUMEX> for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> .
     The last time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> experienced a trough was during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985-86</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
     The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> has cut off domestic funds from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time to slow inflation .
     In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> and institutions following the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> killings have been a big setback .
     `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Wong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mannesmann AG</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> machinery-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Import growth from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier months</TIMEX> slowed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , compared with an average growth rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first eight months of 1989</TIMEX> , imports grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.32 billion</NUMEX> , down slightly from a growth rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The picture for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
     Exports in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first eight months</TIMEX> grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 31.48 billion</NUMEX> , compared with a growth rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> customs figures .
     The threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings .
     The reserves dropped for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     The trend has prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> to intensify efforts to curb imports .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have recentralized trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">wool</ENAMEX> and scores of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">products</ENAMEX> and commodities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade</ENAMEX> set up a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that the best way to get through the drought is by helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> export .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissho Iwai Corp.</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> , now buys almost twice as many goods from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> as it sells to that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three years ago</TIMEX> , the ratio was reversed .
     But the strategy is n't helping much this time .
     `` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masahiko Kitamura</ENAMEX> , general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissho Iwai</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Canton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     He expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's trading business to drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 40 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">a short time after June 4 </ENAMEX>, it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright .
     Many foreign trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> urging them not to sever ties .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of China </ENAMEX>, which normally took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's financial health .
     But when foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> was just a smokescreen .
     The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's national trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which are among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's biggest importers .
     Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shanghai Investment & Trust Co.</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sitco</ENAMEX> , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">financier</ENAMEX> for trading business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sitco</ENAMEX> had customarily tapped the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer .
     Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is strapped for cash .
     `` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who is familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sitco</ENAMEX> 's business .
     `` How can it make available funds for purchases ? ''
     Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> also say many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Lee</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 70 %</NUMEX> of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> .
     `` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says .
     Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30 % and 40 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> .
     And foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next two to five years</TIMEX> .
     Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fertilizers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> .
     These have been among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's leading imports , particularly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> when there were shortages that led many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to buy heavily and pay dearly .
     But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices .
     To stem speculation , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> imposed ceiling prices that went into effect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock .
     The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's export business .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamm</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> , estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Guangdong</ENAMEX> 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials .

     Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws
     AN UNRESOLVED <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">two-year-old</TIMEX> dispute stemming from an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of such accidents .
     The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pipeline</ENAMEX> and compensates those harmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> spills .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 2 , 1987</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tanker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">S.S. Glacier Bay</ENAMEX> struck a rock and spilled <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">almost 150,000 gallons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Cook Inlet</ENAMEX> .
     Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processors</ENAMEX> filed suit in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in a claim that has ballooned to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 104.8 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Defendants</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Petroleum America</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trinidad Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipper</ENAMEX> ; and the pipeline liability fund .
     The fund was created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act</ENAMEX> , which provides that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessel</ENAMEX> involved in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> spill must pay the first <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 million</NUMEX> in damages .
     The fund is required to pay claims up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 86 million</NUMEX> .
     The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Glacier Bay</ENAMEX> case , the fund 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trinidad Corp.</ENAMEX> is contesting liability .
     It claims the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages .
     That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Oil Pollution Act</ENAMEX> , scheduled to come up for a vote in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> , would provide that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> are n't paid within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 days</TIMEX> of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessel</ENAMEX> , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Miller</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of the bill .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . ''
     Many Law School <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Grads</ENAMEX> Find Classes Never End
     RECENT LAW school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> are starting jobs with law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> -- and heading back to class .

     `` Law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Weitz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York County Lawyers ' Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> that sponsors such a course .

     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> , large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> hire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 30</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Henning</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hildebrandt Inc.</ENAMEX> , a consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that runs training classes .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , which will handle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courthouses</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Edelman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors</ENAMEX> .
     Designs call for an L-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">structure</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">playground</ENAMEX> in the center .
     There will be recreation and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtrooms</ENAMEX> will be smaller , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlene Saunders</ENAMEX> , a court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> .
     The bench will be lower so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals .
     Cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Los Angeles County</ENAMEX> involving dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are usually heard in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Criminal Courts Building</ENAMEX> .
     `` We need to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman </ENAMEX>.

     That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Altman & Weil Inc.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ardmore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , law firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .
     Its survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 to 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , shows that managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> earned an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 395,974</NUMEX> in compensation and cash benefits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 fiscal years</TIMEX> .
     Managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> who responded to the survey typically spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> their time supervising their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> operations and just a little more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of their time practicing law .

     What <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> ?
     To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora Worth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm DeWitt</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">33</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">39</TIMEX> respectively , live together in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">townhouse</ENAMEX> in a transitional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> neighborhood .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film-maker</ENAMEX> turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> , has just seen his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> , a fly-by-night real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX> , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stylist</ENAMEX> , prepping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">burgers</ENAMEX> , frosty cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">drinks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">comestibles</ENAMEX> to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> feel trapped .
     They seem to be having the `` worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit . ''
     It 's a downbeat , `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">thirtysomething</TIMEX> '' world , in which bright , still youngish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do .
     Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> faces bankruptcy and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> audit , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX> finds an extra <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30,000</NUMEX> in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold .
     While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David </ENAMEX>, a film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom .
     In novels of an earlier vintage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> would have represented excitement and danger ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm </ENAMEX>, placid , middle-class security .
     The irony in this novel is that neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX> 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty .
     In making <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX> such wonderfully representative specimens of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeidner</ENAMEX> has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> .
     The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -LRB- even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> ' own -RRB- are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may well feel the pangs of recognition .
     In any case , the foundering middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction .

     Patrician , dynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Thatcher</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PegaSys</ENAMEX> , initially finds the takeover threat risible .
     But , as he and his skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> soon discover , they 're up against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors they had n't counted on : <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , a business climate in which a failing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> , that standing behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AIW</ENAMEX> is a sinister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">interests</ENAMEX> secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garber</ENAMEX> manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and fast-paced action of a suspense novel .
     And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> battle it out .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garber</ENAMEX> depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures .
     Standard-issue portraits of flaky <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> , snobbish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Neanderthal</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> undermine the force of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> 's perceptions .
     Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AIW</ENAMEX> were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dolt</ENAMEX> , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process .

     High-definition television promises to be the TV of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , so it is a natural <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX> market .
     Although major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , not everyone here is ready to give up .
     A handful of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     With only small help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , these start-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> are trying to compete with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliaths</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Photonics Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Northwood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">40 inches</NUMEX> in diameter but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">only a few inches</NUMEX> thick .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Planar Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beaverton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore.</ENAMEX> , the largest of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> revenue , has similar plans .
     It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Troy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays .
     The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set .
     Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</NUMEX> business world-wide within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> .
     Large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment .
     But except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is collaborating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thompson-CSF</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized .
     `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zvi Yaniv</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ovonic Imaging</ENAMEX> .
     He says he thinks his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> from doing that .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     The only material support it is extending to the struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> in awards from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DARPA</ENAMEX> funds are a pittance compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and other prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">competitors</ENAMEX> are spending .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and industry spending on HDTV research is already over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> .
     `` Unless it gets more help , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry wo n't have a chance , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Friedman </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Photonics</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratories</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Brody </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Magnascreen</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> innovations in color television and video recording .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> helped develop the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX> 's research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">labs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million or more</NUMEX> picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to find other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">backers</ENAMEX> .
     He has a claim to the right to commercialize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have just given up , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> says .
     `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> want to enter . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> question the industry 's need for federal support ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> justifies its help on national-security grounds .
     `` We do n't see a domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">source</ENAMEX> for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kelly </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DARPA</ENAMEX> 's defense manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DARPA</ENAMEX> is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds .
     HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> is ordering displays for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Aegis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cruisers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> wants smaller versions for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Abrams</ENAMEX> battle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tanks</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
     `` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Clifford </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> of microelectronics and instrumentation .
     `` The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . ''
     Although some HDTV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortia</ENAMEX> , the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> simply would prefer more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DARPA</ENAMEX> funds .
     Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial .
     They also want <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade policy to reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> 's concern over their future .
     They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matsushita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> imposes on the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> color TVs .
     And they want the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to help them sell overseas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Planar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hurd</ENAMEX> says he has to pay tariffs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 15 %</NUMEX> to sell his display panels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , while panels from those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> duty-free .
     `` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says .
     `` We just have n't learned what it takes to compete .
