     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> decided to grant duty-free status for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> nearly single-handedly bought up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 701 million</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> said .
     The purchases show the strong interest of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> mortgage-based instruments , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David O. Maxwell</ENAMEX> , said at a news conference .
     He said <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90 %</NUMEX> of the funds were placed with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The rest went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> snapped up a similar , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</NUMEX> mortgage-backed securities mutual fund .
     That fund was put together by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     The latest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> funds were assembled jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa Securities Co .</ENAMEX>
     The new , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> funds -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> interbank offered rate -- offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key advantages to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to redeploy their money at lower rates .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , they channel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> mortgage payments into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">semiannual</TIMEX> payments , reducing the administrative burden on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     By addressing those problems , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> . ''
     Such devices have boosted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment in mortgage-backed securities to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 1 %</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $ 900 billion</NUMEX> in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate .
     They also have become large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> 's corporate debt , buying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> bonds during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first nine months of the year</TIMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a tenth</NUMEX> of the total amount issued .

     The next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> ?
     `` Anything 's possible -- how about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Guinea</ENAMEX> Fund ? '' quips <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Foot</ENAMEX> , a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newgate Management Associates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Northampton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass</ENAMEX> .
     The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the `` closed-end fund mania '' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foot</ENAMEX> says , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular .
     They fell into oblivion after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> crash .
     Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds , most of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-country portfolios are the `` closed-end '' type , issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly .
     The surge brings to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 50</NUMEX> the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     These funds now account for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several billions of dollars</NUMEX> in assets .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are looking to stake their claims '' now before the number of available <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> runs out , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Porter</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition .
     As individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have turned away from the stock market over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> , securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> have scrambled to find new products that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> find easy to sell .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are stretching their nets far and wide to do it .
     Financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> often urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities .
     And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     But it does n't take much to get burned .
     Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .
     Another concern : The funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market .
     When the stock market dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 7 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , for instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> Fund plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 18 %</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> .
     And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     What 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios .
     After trading at an average discount of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">late 1987</TIMEX> and part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , country funds currently trade at an average premium of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> .
     The reason : Share prices of many of these funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold .
     It 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> say .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> funds recently have skyrocketed ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund has surged to a startling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">120 %</NUMEX> premium .
     It has been targeted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> as a good long-term play tied to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> economic integration .
     And several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums .
     `` I 'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> .
     The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> suggests .
     Unlike many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds .
     `` There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> says .
     Nonetheless , plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds .
     They argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> often can buy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> traded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     That way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newgate</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foot</ENAMEX> says : `` The only advice I have for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly .

     If the debts are repaid , it could clear the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> bonds to be sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     However , after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meetings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said that it 's `` too early to say '' whether that will happen .
     Coincident with the talks , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> said it has permitted a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs</ENAMEX> was approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> and opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     But a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> here would be crippled unless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> found a way to settle the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188 million</NUMEX> debt , which was lent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's short-lived democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerensky</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> seized power in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1917</TIMEX> .
     Under a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1934</TIMEX> law , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Johnson Debt Default Act</ENAMEX> , as amended , it 's illegal for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to extend credit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> in default to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , unless they are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> belongs to neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> has settled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre-1917</TIMEX> debts with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> at less than face value .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> stressed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre-1933</TIMEX> debts as the key to satisfying the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Johnson Act</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> until they settle <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> in additional debt still outstanding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> lend-lease program .

     In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Association of Purchasing Management</ENAMEX> said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the sixth consecutive month</TIMEX> .
     Its index inched up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Any reading below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
     The purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , however , also said that orders turned up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four months</TIMEX> of decline .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Factories</ENAMEX> booked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 236.74 billion</NUMEX> in orders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , nearly the same as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 236.79 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said .
     If not for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59.6 %</NUMEX> surge in orders for capital goods by defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">contractors</ENAMEX> , factory orders would have fallen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</NUMEX> .
     In a separate report , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said construction spending ran at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 415.6 billion</NUMEX> , not significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $ 415.8 billion</NUMEX> reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .
     The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonal</TIMEX> patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Mayland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Society Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off .
     At the same time , the drop in interest rates since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring</TIMEX> has failed to revive the residential construction industry .
     `` What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? '' he asked .
     `` I draw a blank . ''
     By most measures , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all .
     Factory payrolls fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     So did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> 's industrial-production index .
     Yet many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession .
     They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn .
     Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , the first decline since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1987</TIMEX> .
     `` This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Platt</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . ''
     A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">department</ENAMEX> said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">fewer than three years</TIMEX> -- fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 109.73 billion</NUMEX> after climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month before</TIMEX> .
     Orders for durable goods were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 127.03 billion</NUMEX> after rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month before</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">department</ENAMEX> previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Factory shipments fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 234.4 billion</NUMEX> after rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Shipments have been relatively level since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> noted .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 497.34 billion</NUMEX> , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector .
     Excluding these orders , backlogs declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> .
     In its construction spending report , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said residential construction , which accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of all construction spending , was off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.9 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Berson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mortgage Bankers Association</ENAMEX> , predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> , but probably not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 %</NUMEX> to an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99.1 billion</NUMEX> with no sector showing strength .
     Government construction spending rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 88 billion</NUMEX> .
     After adjusting for inflation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said construction spending did n't change in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first nine months of the year</TIMEX> , total construction spending ran <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</NUMEX> above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's level .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">F.W. Dodge Group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> reported an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> increase in construction contracts awarded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">goverment</ENAMEX> counts money as it is spent ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> counts contracts when they are awarded .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> includes money spent on residential renovation ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> does n't .
     Although the purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bretz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> 's survey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of materials management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pitney Bowes Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
     He said the index would have to be in the low <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> range for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months</TIMEX> to be considered a forecast of recession .
     The report offered new evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 19 %</NUMEX> of the purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> reported better export orders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     And <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> said export orders were down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month before</TIMEX> .
     The purhasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fifth consecutive month</TIMEX> , purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said prices for the goods they purchased fell .
     The decline was even steeper than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     They also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vendors</ENAMEX> were delivering goods more quickly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> than they had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each of the five previous months</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .
     When demand is stronger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers</ENAMEX> can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise .
     The purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ' report is based on data provided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</NUMEX> purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> survey polled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on imports .
     It found that of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 %</NUMEX> who import , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> said they imported more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> said they imported less than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous month</TIMEX> .
     While acknowledging <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one month</TIMEX> 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bretz</ENAMEX> said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''
     Items listed as being in short supply numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a dozen</NUMEX> , but they included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> newcomer : <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk powder</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's an odd thing to put on the list , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bretz</ENAMEX> noted .
     He said that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second month in a row</TIMEX> , food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">processors</ENAMEX> reported a shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">nonfat dry milk</ENAMEX> .
     They blamed increased demand for dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">products</ENAMEX> at a time of exceptionally high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">dry milk</ENAMEX> , coupled with very low import quotas .

     Judging from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americana</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haruki Murakami</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">A Wild Sheep Chase</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodansha</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> have a lot in common .
     Although set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Characters</ENAMEX> drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:FOOD">Salty Dogs</ENAMEX> , whistle `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Johnny B. Goode</ENAMEX> '' and watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bugs Bunny</ENAMEX> reruns .
     They read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Spillane</ENAMEX> and talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harpo</ENAMEX> .
     They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
     This is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> ?
     For an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> lore .
     It 's also refreshing to read a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> who clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing `` we-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> '' school of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who perpetuate the notion of the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , unfathomable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> .
     If `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">A Wild Sheep Chase</ENAMEX> '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are more like us than most of us think .
     That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">A Wild Sheep Chase</ENAMEX> '' is rooted in reality .
     It 's imaginative and often funny .
     A disaffected , hard-drinking , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> sets off for snow country in search of an elusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobster</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford</ENAMEX> degree .
     He has in tow his prescient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> .
     Along the way , he meets a solicitous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chauffeur</ENAMEX> who offers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> God 's phone number ; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheep Man</ENAMEX> , a sweet , roughhewn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">40-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murakami</ENAMEX> is a publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .

     But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fans</ENAMEX> politely return foul balls to stadium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ushers</ENAMEX> ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Tokyo Giants</ENAMEX> , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .

     In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katzenstein</ENAMEX> describes how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> invades even the most mundane aspects of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ' lives -- at the regimented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are assigned lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> -- and at `` home '' in the austere company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">dormitory</ENAMEX> run by a prying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caretaker</ENAMEX> .
     Some of his observations about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> management style are on the mark .
     It 's probably true that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salarymen</ENAMEX> put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> can talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was chary of letting a young , short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> take on any responsibility .
     All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katzenstein</ENAMEX> , who went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Walkman</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> ultimately took a lesson from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> management books and fired Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katzenstein</ENAMEX> , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akio Morita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> .
     It 's a shame their meeting never took place .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katzenstein</ENAMEX> certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morita</ENAMEX> would have too .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's deputy editorial features <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> , worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> .
     More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> , a new law requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> to put out their cigarettes before entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">restaurants</ENAMEX> , department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> or face a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> fine .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Discos</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clubs</ENAMEX> are exempt from the ban , and smoking will be permitted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bars</ENAMEX> except during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">meal hours</TIMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> already bans smoking in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">theaters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">buses</ENAMEX> , public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">elevators</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> and fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">restaurants</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siti Zaharah Sulaiman</ENAMEX> , a deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> , launched a `` No-Smoking Week '' at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Mara Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> and urged other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> to ban on-campus smoking .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> has different concerns .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> began visiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 26,000</NUMEX> cigarette <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stalls</ENAMEX> to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
     A marketing study indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are the most materialistic in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> major markets where the survey was carried out .
     The study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> also found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">colony</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The survey found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than three</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cabinet</ENAMEX> endorsed Finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pramual Sabhavasu</ENAMEX> 's proposal to build a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 million</NUMEX> conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> for a joint meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     The meeting , which is expected to draw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bangkok</ENAMEX> , was going to be held at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Central Plaza Hotel</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> balked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion .
     A major concern about the current plan is whether the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> can be built in such a short time .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> has written to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Olympic Committee</ENAMEX> asking him to back a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> bid to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Palestine Liberation Organization</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WAFA</ENAMEX> said .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Palestinian Olympic Committee</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> applied for membership in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> and renewed its application in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August of this year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PLO</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> has been trying to join international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> but failed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> to win membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Tourism Organization</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> food-shop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> has become the first mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> through sex , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">People 's Daily</ENAMEX> said .
     It said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , whom it did not name , had been found to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> after hospital tests .
     Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> was confirmed , all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were tested , but none have so far been found to have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had for a long time had `` a chaotic sex life , '' including relations with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> increased home electricity charges by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">150 %</NUMEX> and doubled gas prices .
     The official news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">PAP</ENAMEX> said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .
     In happier news , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , in establishing diplomatic ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , announced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450 million</NUMEX> in loans to the financially strapped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     In a victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> terminated a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">River Danube</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dam</ENAMEX> being built by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Nagymaros</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dam</ENAMEX> was designed to be twinned with another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dam</ENAMEX> , now nearly complete , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">100 miles</NUMEX> upstream in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> .
     In ending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> 's part of the project , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miklos Nemeth</ENAMEX> to modify a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> , which still wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dam</ENAMEX> to be built .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nemeth</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> would suffer environmental damage if the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dams</ENAMEX> were built as planned .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> it could seek <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">twindam</ENAMEX> contract were broken .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Czech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dam</ENAMEX> ca n't be operated solely at peak periods without the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Nagymaros</ENAMEX> project .
     A painting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August Strindberg</ENAMEX> set a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> price record when it sold at auction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.44 million</NUMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Lighthouse II</ENAMEX> '' was painted in oils by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1901</TIMEX> ...
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of decline , weddings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> showed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2 %</NUMEX> upturn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> exchanging rings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> , the national statistics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> said .
     But the number of weddings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271,124</NUMEX> -- was still well below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the 400,000</NUMEX> registered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> of increasing marriages .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BRAMALEA Ltd.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to issue <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 million Canadian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 85.1 million</NUMEX> -RRB- of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.5 %</NUMEX> senior debentures due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 30 , 1999</TIMEX> , together with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> bond purchase warrants .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said each bond warrant entitles the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 1,000</NUMEX> principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase .
     The warrants expire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 30 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     The issue will be swapped into fixed-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars at a rate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said is less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> ; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> declined to elaborate .
     Lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> for the issue are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scotia McLeod Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RBC Dominion Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bramalea</ENAMEX> said it expects to complete the issue by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> .

     As an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lane</ENAMEX> is n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inheritor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Chaplin</ENAMEX> 's spirit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Martin</ENAMEX> has already laid his claim to that .
     But it is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> , as movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> , who has been obsessed with refitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Tramp</ENAMEX> in a contemporary way .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , as a film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Purchase</ENAMEX> campus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">State University of New York</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> shot `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">A Place in Time</ENAMEX> , '' a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36-minute</TIMEX> black-and-white film about a sketch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> .
     Now , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">13 years later</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> has revived his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> in a full-length movie called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> , '' a poignant piece of work about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">modern-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tramp</ENAMEX> .
     Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> would be called a homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> .
     So would the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Tramp</ENAMEX> , for that matter .
     I say `` contained dialogue '' because `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> '' is n't really silent at all .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Composer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Marder</ENAMEX> , a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">ensembles</ENAMEX> , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would .
     Much of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> 's notion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tramp</ENAMEX> as the good-hearted free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Filmed in lovely black and white by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Dill</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> '' seem benign .
     On Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cabs</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> hangs out in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Greenwich Village</ENAMEX> , on a strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Sixth Avenue</ENAMEX> populated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jugglers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magicians</ENAMEX> and other good-natured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- This clearly is not real life : no crack <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , no dead-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">four-year-old</TIMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB-
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> has his routine .
     He spends <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his days</TIMEX> sketching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX> , or trying to .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> he returns to the condemned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> he calls <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> .
     His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> , seems carefree .
     He is his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> .
     Then , just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tramp</ENAMEX> is given a blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> to cure in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">City Lights</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> is put in charge of returning a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">two-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waif</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Alysia</ENAMEX> -RRB- , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has been murdered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX> , to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> .
     This cute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> turns out to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> .
     She gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .
     The beds at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Bowery Mission</ENAMEX> seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> into one of them at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> .
     To further load the stakes , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> , with a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who owns her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> .
     This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX> 's vagabond existence .
     He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force .
     The movie ends with sound , the sound of street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Chabrol</ENAMEX> has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Story of Women</ENAMEX> . ''
     He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable .
     Yet this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Louise Giraud</ENAMEX> , carries historical significance , both as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to be executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Vichy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's hypocrisy .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Vichy</ENAMEX> collaborated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> in the deaths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Resistance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> needed a diversionary symbolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traitor</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Louise</ENAMEX> , a small-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abortionist</ENAMEX> , was their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> .
     She became an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abortionist</ENAMEX> accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">jam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> and other war-rationed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">goodies</ENAMEX> .
     She was untrained and , in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> botched job killed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> .
     Her remorse was shallow and brief .
     Although she was kind and playful to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , she was dreadful to her war-damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> ; she openly brought her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> into their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> .
     As presented by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chabrol</ENAMEX> , and played with thin-lipped intensity by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabelle Huppert</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Louise</ENAMEX> -LRB- called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Latour</ENAMEX> in the film -RRB- was not a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> .
     But she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off .
     There is very little to recommend `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Old Gringo</ENAMEX> , '' a confused rendering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Fuentes</ENAMEX> novel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX> .
     Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory .
     I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Peck</ENAMEX> , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who wants to die the way he wants to die .

     The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd .</ENAMEX>

     This is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> the negative ad , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> presence in most political campaigns , became the main event .
     The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's presidential campaign , has come of age in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an off-off election year</TIMEX> with only a few contests scattered across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     But in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> leading political contests of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content .
     `` Now , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Napolitan</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> in political television , `` the idea is to attack <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , last and always . ''
     A trend that started with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , has reached an entirely new stage .
     `` To get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's attention these days , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Bailey</ENAMEX> , a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
     And , unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves .
     Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> :
     The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> failed to file his income taxes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four straight years</TIMEX> , '' says a disembodied male voice .
     And then this television commercial , paid for by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">campaign</ENAMEX> and produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ailes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and paid a convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kidnapper</ENAMEX> `` through a phony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> with no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , no receipts and no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? ''
     `` Nasty innuendoes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Siegal</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's issues <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . ''
     Stung by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> ads , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Shrum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Doak</ENAMEX> , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
     The screen shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> .
     `` Compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> says he 's for banning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>-killer bullets .
     The other has opposed a ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>-killer bullets .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> claims he 's pro-choice .
     The other has opposed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's right to choose . ''
     `` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> . ''
     Who 's telling the truth ?
     Everybody -- and nobody .
     It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> did fail to file his income taxes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
     He was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of an insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campaign Finance Board</ENAMEX> has refused to pay Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95,142</NUMEX> in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .
     The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
     And , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , he did n't know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">campaign</ENAMEX> paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
     But , say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , he did have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> did have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> 's campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Powers</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> ad is `` deceptive . ''
     The other side , he argues , `` knows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
     They know he is generally opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lt. Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Wilder</ENAMEX> opened his gubernatorial battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Coleman</ENAMEX> with an abortion commercial produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Greer</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
     Against a shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Monticello</ENAMEX> superimposed on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Virginians</ENAMEX> have nurtured for generations .
     Then , just as an image of the statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> dissolves from the screen , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> continues : `` On the issue of abortion , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Coleman</ENAMEX> wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> . ''
     That commercial -- which said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
     The ad prompted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> , to launch a series of advertisements created by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Goodman</ENAMEX> and designed to shake Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> 's support among the very <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were attracted by the abortion ad .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> counterattack featured a close-up of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
     A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriends</ENAMEX> ? ''
     Then an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> interjects : `` It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Wilder</ENAMEX> who introduced a bill to force rape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 13</TIMEX> and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> .
     So the next time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> talks about the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> did introduce such legislation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17 years ago</TIMEX> , but he did so at the request of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> , a common legislative technique used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> .
     The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> introduced a bill to protect rape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> from unfounded interrogation .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have grown tired of these ads and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> has gotten the stigma of being a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campaigner</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Rozell</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">political scientist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Mary Washington College</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> has managed to get across the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> will say anything to get elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only hours</TIMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> were carrying new ads featuring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> himself raising questions about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> 's sensitivity to rape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> :
     The attacks began when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Florio</ENAMEX> aired an ad featuring a drawing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinocchio</ENAMEX> and a photograph of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Courter</ENAMEX> .
     `` Remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinocchio</ENAMEX> ? '' says a female voice .
     `` Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Courter</ENAMEX> . ''
     And then this commercial , produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Squier</ENAMEX> , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
     Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's -RCB- property -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> are suing for consumer fraud . ''
     And the nose on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's face grows .
     The only fraud involved , cry Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX> , is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> commercial itself , and so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">campaign</ENAMEX> has responded with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinocchio</ENAMEX> commercial , produced by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ailes</ENAMEX> .
     In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> .
     `` Who 's really lying ? '' asks a female voice .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's long nose shrinks while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's grows .
     Who 's telling the truth ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Salmore</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">political scientist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eagleton Institute</ENAMEX> , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate .
     Barrels were dumped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
     Even so , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salmore</ENAMEX> , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's credibility .
     But it 's building on a long tradition .

     Interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> capital may produce the economic cooperation that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southeast Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> have pursued in fits and starts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> .

     The flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment machine , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hormats</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs International Corp .</ENAMEX>

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> ' harsh memories of their military domination by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> in the early part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">this century</TIMEX> make them fearful of falling under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> economic hegemony <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     Because of budget constraints in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to share economic burdens in the region .
     But it resists yielding political ground .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming decade</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> relations will be tested as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">behemoth</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's swelling investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> is part of its economic evolution .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> concentrated on domestic production for export .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s</TIMEX> , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yen</NUMEX> , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will increasingly turn themselves into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">multinationals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> around the world .
     To capture the investment , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southeast Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> will move to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> business .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> ' internal decisions `` will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">donor</ENAMEX> , largest private <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">investor</ENAMEX> and largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">lender</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Drobnick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the international business and research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">program</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Southern California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Graduate School of Business</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> money will help turn <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> into a more cohesive economic region .
     But , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> cooperation is n't likely to parallel the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Common Market</ENAMEX> approach .
     Rather , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Calder</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX> economies at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Princeton University</ENAMEX> .
     In electronics , for example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> might make television picture tubes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , assemble the sets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and export them to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia</ENAMEX> .
     `` The effect will be to pull <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> together not as a common <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">market</ENAMEX> but as an integrated production <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">zone</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hormats</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">Countries</ENAMEX> in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
     The economic and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> will meet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">Participants</ENAMEX> will include the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> as well as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Thailand</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">the Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brunei</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> offered its own plan for cooperation around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> rim in a major speech by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> , following up a proposal made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hawke</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> proposal reasserts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region .
     `` In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> , as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , a new order is taking shape , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , with its regional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">friends</ENAMEX> , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ''
     But maintaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> influence will be difficult in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> dominance in the region .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> not only outstrips the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southeast Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> -LRB- although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> remains the leading trade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">partner</ENAMEX> for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , now the world 's largest aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">donor</ENAMEX> , is pumping far more assistance into the region than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> voice optimism about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's enlarged role in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> , they also convey an undertone of caution .
     `` There 's an understanding on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has to expand its functions '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Michael Farren</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undersecretary</ENAMEX> of commerce for trade .
     `` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> are apprehensive about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's demand that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> step up its military spending to ease the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> security burden in the region .
     The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's leases on military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bases</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> and by a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> troop reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> regard a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> presence as a desirable counterweight to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> influence .
     `` No one wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to pick up its marbles and go <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hormats</ENAMEX> says .
     For their part , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> are expected to step up their own investments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next decade</TIMEX> to try to slow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> juggernaut .
     `` They do n't want <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chong-sik Lee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX> politics at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathryn Rice</ENAMEX> could hardly believe her eyes .
     While giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ninth graders</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last March 16</TIMEX> , she spotted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> looking at crib sheets .
     She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny .
     `` A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbroker</ENAMEX> is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... .
     At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> surrendered before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> ... .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> conference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> is used when a bill is passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> in different forms . ''
     Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> was taking .
     In fact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> had the answers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost all of the 40</NUMEX> questions in that section .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> surrendered the notes , but not without a protest .
     `` My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in question was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Yeargin</ENAMEX> -- considered by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the best at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     Confronted , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> admitted she had given the questions and answers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> before the examination to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> low-ability geography <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> .
     She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> was fired and prosecuted under an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , she pleaded guilty and paid a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> fine .
     Her alternative was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> .
     Her story is partly one of personal downfall .
     She was an unstinting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who won laurels and inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , but she will probably never teach again .
     In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> who was her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and now calls her a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">betrayer</ENAMEX> ; of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who say she brought them shame ; of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school-district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> statute Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> violated was designed to enforce provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> 's school-improvement laws .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> alleged that she was trying to bolster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> ' scores to win a bonus under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Improvement Act</ENAMEX> .
     The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores .
     `` There is incredible pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school systems</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to raise test scores , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Haney</ENAMEX> , an education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> and testing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Boston College</ENAMEX> .
     `` So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise . ''
     And most disturbing , it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> , not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-state study released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Friends for Education</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX> , school-research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">group</ENAMEX> , concluded that `` outright cheating by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> '' is `` common . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">group</ENAMEX> says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> did , although most are never caught .
     Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last year or so</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> suspects adult responsibility for erasures at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
     After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> is revising its security practices .
     And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .
     These materials , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Scoring High</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .
     By using them , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers .
     Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Scoring High</ENAMEX> is widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Greenville County</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's school district .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> say there is n't another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> where tests mean as much as they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> .
     Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Improvement Act</ENAMEX> , low test scores can block <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> ' promotions or force entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">districts</ENAMEX> into wrenching , state-supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings .
     High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lab</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , grants for special projects , a bonus for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> says it is getting results .
     Since the reforms went in place , for example , no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scholastic Aptitude Test</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> still posts the lowest average score of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> who use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">SAT</ENAMEX> as the primary college entrance examination .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Friends of Education</ENAMEX> rates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> one of the worst <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> in its study on academic cheating .
     Says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cannell</ENAMEX> , prosecuting Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> is `` a way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Sandifer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of testing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> of education , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannell</ENAMEX> 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences .
     Partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> 's reforms were designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> .
     Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> has educated many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> 's best and brightest , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Townes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanne Woodward</ENAMEX> .
     But by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade .
     `` It was full of violence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">gangs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> cutting class , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Ward</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> .
     `` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> took over in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> .
     Her immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> suffered a nervous breakdown .
     Prior to his term , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> bled to death in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">halls</ENAMEX> , stabbed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> .
     Academically , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> was having trouble serving in harmony its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disparate , and evenly split , student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> : a privileged white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> from old monied neighborhoods and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> , many of them poor , from run-down , inner city neighborhoods .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> resolved to clean out `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deadwood</ENAMEX> '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .
     One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment .
     Another was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Yeargin</ENAMEX> , who came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenville</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , full of the energy and ambitions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> wanted to reward .
     `` Being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> just became my life , '' says the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">37-year-old</TIMEX> Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 years</TIMEX> before her dismissal . ``
     I loved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , its history .
     I even dreamt about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> and new things to do with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> . ''
     While Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> fired and restructured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> and fast became a student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986-87</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987-88</TIMEX> , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law .
     Encouraged by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> taught honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to consider teaching as a career .
     She won grant money for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cheerleaders</ENAMEX> , ran the pep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">club</ENAMEX> , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">PTA</ENAMEX> as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX> of the Year . ''
     `` She was an inspirational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> ; she had it all together , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Dobson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freshman</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of South Carolina</ENAMEX> who had Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> in the teacher-cadet class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     She says that because of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Beth Marchand</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">11th grader</ENAMEX> , also says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> inspired her to go into education .
     `` She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelli Green</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> say , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekends</TIMEX> , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> .
     `` She just never gave it up , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Marchand</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Beth</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> .
     `` You 'd see her correcting homework in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football game</ENAMEX> . ''
     Some fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> , however , viewed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> as cocky and too yielding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says she often defended her to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who called her a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandstander</ENAMEX> .
     Pressures began to build .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> told her she was pushing too hard .
     Because of deteriorating hearing , she told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> she feared she might not be able to teach much longer .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's incentive-bonus program .
     But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .
     Huge gains by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> meant a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> in bonuses over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> -- a meaningful addition to her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> salary of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23,000</NUMEX> .
     Winning a bonus for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a third year</TIMEX> was n't that important to her , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> insists .
     But others at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Greenville High</ENAMEX> say she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Elizabeth Ariail</ENAMEX> , another social-studies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> , says she believed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing .
     Indeed , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last March</TIMEX> , after attending a teaching seminar in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> says she returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenville</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low-ability geography <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> adequately .
     When test booklets were passed out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
     `` I was trying to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in an unfair testing situation , '' she says .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> questions were geography questions .
     The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects they never had . ''
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> says that she also wanted to help lift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> district high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> in rankings carried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     Mostly , she says , she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> would suffer from doing badly on the test .
     `` These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> broke my heart , '' she says .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">A whole day</TIMEX> goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .
     They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them .
     The last thing they needed was another drag-down blow . ''
     School <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> say Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> is lying .
     They found <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in an advanced class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> who said she gave them similar help , although because the case was n't tried in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , this evidence was never presented publicly .
     `` That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Watson</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> in the case , who is also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> 's alumni <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">association</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class , adding : `` I wanted to help all '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> never complained to school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that the standardized test was unfair .
     `` Do I have much sympathy for her ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> asks .
     `` Not really .
     I believe in the system .
     I believe you have to use the system to change it .
     What she did was like taking the law into your own hands . ''
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring .
     She says she offered Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> declined .
     `` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> . '
     I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> recalls .
     `` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . ''
     To the astonishment and dismay of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> and legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> won widespread local support .
     The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who came to testify on her behalf .
     Supportive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> decried unfair testing , not Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared .
     The show did n't give the particulars of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> 's offense , saying only that she helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> do better on the test .
     `` The message to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">board</ENAMEX> of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , '' said the talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> .
     Editorials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> allowed that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .
     The radio show `` enraged us , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> .
     Partly because of the show , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record .
     And legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> , mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , were interviewed .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> -- especially on the cheerleading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">squad</ENAMEX> -- were crushed .
     `` It 's hard to explain to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">17-year-old</TIMEX> why someone they like had to go , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> .
     Soon , T-shirts appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">corridors</ENAMEX> that carried the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> 's familiar red-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">GHS</ENAMEX> logo on the front .
     On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> are angry at Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> .
     `` She did a lot of harm , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathryn Rice</ENAMEX> , who had discovered the crib notes .
     `` We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''
     But several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> by using standardized test scores .
     Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gayle Key</ENAMEX> , a mathematics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> , `` The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms .
     There may be others doing what she did . ''
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> , for one , was relieved .
     Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeargin</ENAMEX> , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> says , that `` I 'm afraid a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> would n't have convicted her .

     Since chalk first touched slate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> have wanted to know : What 's on the test ?
     These <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> give them in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> prior to taking standardized achievement tests .
     The mathematics section of the widely used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">California Achievement Test</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifth graders</ENAMEX> : `` What is another name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> numeral <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> ? ''
     It also asks them to add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-sevenths</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-sevenths</NUMEX> .
     Worksheets in a test-practice kit called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> , sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co.</ENAMEX> , contain the same questions .
     In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> .
     What 's more , the test and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> are both produced by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill</ENAMEX> , a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> say .
     Test-preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry .
     But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating .
     `` If I took -LCB- these preparation booklets -RCB- into my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that it was n't cheating , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kaminski</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Traverse City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who has studied test coaching .
     He and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress .
     `` It 's as if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> decided to give only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> history questions to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> , and when everybody aces the test , they say their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are good in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> history , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cannell</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of an educational research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Friends for Education</ENAMEX> , which has studied standardized testing .
     Standardized achievement tests are given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 million</NUMEX> times a year across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> generally from kindergarten through <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade .
     The most widely used of these tests are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan\/McGraw</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">CAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Iowa Test of Basic Skills</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Houghton Mifflin Co.</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Metropolitan Achievement Test</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Stanford Achievement Test</ENAMEX> .
     Sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known , but their reach into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> is significant .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maryland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> say they are common classroom tools .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan\/McGraw</ENAMEX> says `` well over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> '' of its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Scoring High</ENAMEX> test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> , with most sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last five years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 20,000</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> ' binders have also been sold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years</TIMEX> .
     The materials in each set reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scoring High</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> are the best-selling preparation tests .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kean</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CTB Macmillan\/McGraw</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan\/McGraw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> that publishes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> , says it is n't aimed at improving test scores .
     He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated .
     When referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincidental .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaminski</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Mehrens</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Michigan State University</ENAMEX> education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> , concluded in a study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CAT</ENAMEX> test versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scoring High</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> should n't be used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> because of their similarity to the actual test .
     They devised a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>-point scale -- awarding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point for each subskill measured on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CAT</ENAMEX> test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CAT</ENAMEX> .
     Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>-grade curriculum , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaminski</ENAMEX> says , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> matched on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66.5</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> subskills .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scoring High</ENAMEX> matched on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64.5</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CAT</ENAMEX> sections where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> ' knowledge of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-letter consonant sounds is tested , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scoring High</ENAMEX> concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifth graders</ENAMEX> should know .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Learning Materials</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>-grade contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a dozen</NUMEX> examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Brownell</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scoring High</ENAMEX> , says that Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaminski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehrens</ENAMEX> are ignoring `` the need <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format . ''
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Scoring High</ENAMEX> `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants .
     Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> could help treat juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and such degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington 's</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-abortionists</ENAMEX> oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mason</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely . ''
     He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
     Department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HHS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> will support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> oppose federal funding for abortion , as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , except in cases where a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's life is threatened .
     The controversy began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HHS</ENAMEX> review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson 's disease</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX>-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> recommended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> continued to oppose federal funding .
     The dispute has hampered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's efforts to recruit prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Novello</ENAMEX> , whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> nominated to serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon general</ENAMEX> , reportedly has assured the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> that she opposes abortion .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novello</ENAMEX> is deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have charged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> tried to defuse these charges by stressing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CDC</ENAMEX> will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> .
     `` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Genel</ENAMEX> , associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale Medical School</ENAMEX> .
     `` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> is one of the few medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genel</ENAMEX> warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's ruling may discourage private funding .
     `` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">foundations</ENAMEX> to provide support , '' he said .
     Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .
     `` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> '' or to regulate genes that cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Down 's syndrome</ENAMEX> , the leading cause of mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> summary .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> currently spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 8 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 billion</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> warnings stem from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> law that requires anyone who receives <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 10,000</NUMEX> in cash from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 .

     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> is asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to red-flag a criminal problem to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , '' added Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonnett</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who has heard from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who received letters in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> and has himself received the computer-generated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> forms sent by certified mail .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonnett</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who pay cash may include alleged drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> who do n't have domestic bank accounts .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonnett</ENAMEX> said there also may be other circumstances under which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> would n't want the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to know they had retained criminal defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     Filling out detailed forms about these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> would tip the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> off and spark action against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , he said .
     The defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> formed a task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , chaired by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Lefcourt</ENAMEX> , to deal with the matter .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">House of Delegates</ENAMEX> passed a resolution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> condemning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> reporting requirement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ross</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">ABA</ENAMEX> 's grand jury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> , said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are prohibited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">ABA</ENAMEX> 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> except where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> orders it or to prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> from committing a criminal act that could result in death .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> said he met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> , which would bring any enforcement actions against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> , to discuss the issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May</TIMEX> .
     At that meeting , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> without further review and advance notice .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> 's moderate stance on the matter .
     But in the letters sent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher J. Lezovich</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> computing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> , told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''
     In some cases , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> asked for information dating back to forms it received in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> now .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> 's policy said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had n't any knowledge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> 's actions in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> worry that if they provide information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , that data could quickly end up in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
     Some criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> speculated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> was sending the letters to test the issue .
     In a number of recent cases , federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have refused to recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> ' assertions that information relating to fees from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> should be confidential .
     THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> .
     Often , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul A. Ramirez</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> called a news conference to say he was quitting effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 31</TIMEX> to join a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     The reason : the refusal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to give federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> a raise .
     `` A couple of my law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> were going to pass me in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three or four years</TIMEX> , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> quipped in an interview .
     Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 89,500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> ; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramirez</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">44</TIMEX> , said it is unjust for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> to make what they do .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> are not getting what they deserve .
     You look around at professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ballplayers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> ... and nobody blinks an eye .
     When you become a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''
     At his new job , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in charge of federal litigation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Orrick , Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe</ENAMEX> , he will make out much better .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">DOONESBURY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CREATOR</ENAMEX>'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cartoonist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry Trudeau</ENAMEX> is suing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Writers Guild of America East</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screenwriters</ENAMEX> ' picket line .
     The dispute involves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Darkhorse Productions Inc.</ENAMEX> , a TV production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-owner</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Writers Guild</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> , also was employed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Darkhorse</ENAMEX> , which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">guild</ENAMEX> began a strike against the TV and movie industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1988</TIMEX> .
     In his lawsuit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> says the strike illegally included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Darkhorse</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartoonist</ENAMEX> refused to honor the strike against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">guild</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are reviewing the suit .
     He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman K. Samnick</ENAMEX> , said the harassment consists mainly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">guild</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year-long</TIMEX> threats of disciplinary action .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samnick</ENAMEX> said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Monday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samnick</ENAMEX> , who will go before the disciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">guild</ENAMEX> would be unjustified .
     In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">guild</ENAMEX> from punishing or retaliating against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> .
     ABORTION RULING UPHELD :
     A federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> upheld a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ruling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> rule adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> prohibits the use of so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title X</ENAMEX> funds for programs that assist a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals .
     The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title X</ENAMEX> funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services , according to the opinion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">providers</ENAMEX> and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     INQUIRY CLEARS <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">TEXAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">JUDGE</ENAMEX> of bias in comments on homosexual murder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Hampton</ENAMEX> had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> after sentencing an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 years</TIMEX> in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> for killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in a city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> was quoted as referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queers</ENAMEX> '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> picking up teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert R. Murray</ENAMEX> , a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Texas Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hampton</ENAMEX> did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .
     Observing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX> '' as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hampton</ENAMEX> 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
     The report is subject to review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Commission on Judicial Conduct</ENAMEX> , which is empowered to impose sanctions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> TRIAL goes to round <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorneys</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> stock-manipulation trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX> began opening arguments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtroom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Johnson Lowe</ENAMEX> .
     In an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-count indictment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wayne</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James T.
