     A NEW MINIMUM-WAGE PLAN has been worked out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , opening the way for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">over nine years</TIMEX> .
     The compromise proposal , ending a long impasse between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , would boost the minimum wage to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1991</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.35</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> could end up becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> in several business ventures as part of a settlement of their dispute over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> .
     A bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> became more likely as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> unexpectedly decided to end restrictions blocking a takeover of the luxury car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sea Containers</ENAMEX> plans to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> of its common shares for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70</NUMEX> each .

     Bond prices staggered in seesaw trading , rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds got off to a strong start , advancing modestly during overnight trading on foreign markets .
     `` We saw good buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and excellent buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger</ENAMEX> , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Insight Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
     The market 's tempo was helped by the dollar 's resiliency , he said .
     Late in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8410 West German marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.70 Japanese yen</NUMEX> , up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> sterling eased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5775</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5825</NUMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading began , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     The contraction was twice as large as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> projected and was the sharpest decline since a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1982</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> said the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession , which would pave the way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates .
     But later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , a report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Purchasing Management Association of Chicago</ENAMEX> cast doubt on the recession scenario .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> index of economic activity rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.6 %</NUMEX> after having been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months</TIMEX> .
     A reading <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</NUMEX> indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 50 %</NUMEX> suggests that the industry is expanding .
     Bond prices fell after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> report was released .
     By the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , bond prices were mixed .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond was nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> point higher , or up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     New <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes ended unchanged while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> notes were slightly lower .
     Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point higher while mortgage-backed securities were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/8</NUMEX> point .
     Corporate bonds were unchanged .
     In the corporate market , an expected debt offering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> generated considerable attention .
     The giant computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> is slated to offer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> non-callable debentures through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> expect the bonds to yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.60 to 0.65</NUMEX> percentage point above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond , which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> with a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.90 %</NUMEX> .
     The last time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> tapped the corporate debt market was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1988</TIMEX> , when it offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> of debt securities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's visits to the debt market are closely watched by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurers</ENAMEX> at other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and by credit market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has the ability to pinpoint the trough in interest-rate cycles .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1979</TIMEX> , just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> raised interest rates , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in debt securities .
     The boost in rates sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's bonds tumbling , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> of losses and triggering a sell-off in the overall market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> `` ca n't be bullish if they 're doing a sizable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bullet , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     Others said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> might increase the size of the offering to as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> if investor demand is strong .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in debt filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> is a little bit of a fire drill , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Ednee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the industrial bond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` I think as the pricing time arrives , the bonds will come a little richer and in a larger amount . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> prices ended mixed in light trading .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond was quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 12\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 7\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.92 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes were unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 16\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.904 %</NUMEX> .
     Short-term rates also were mixed .
     The discount rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills rose slightly from the average rate at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's auction to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.79 %</NUMEX> for a bond-equivalent yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</NUMEX> .
     The discount rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills fell slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.60 %</NUMEX> for a bond-equivalent yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.99 %</NUMEX> .
     Corporate Issues
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> junk bond issues were priced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , including a scaled-backed offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice Co .</ENAMEX>
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX> cut its high-yield offering to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 251 million</NUMEX> from a planned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> after it became clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would have to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> higher yields .
     In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part offering , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 151 million</NUMEX> of senior subordinated reset notes were priced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.75</NUMEX> and carried a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 3\/4 %</NUMEX> , while <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $ 100 million</NUMEX> of senior subordinated floating rate notes were priced to float at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.25</NUMEX> percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate , or LIBOR .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> LIBOR rate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 7\/16 %</NUMEX> .
     Since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> other junk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> have said they plan to scale back planned high-yield offerings , and several issues have been postponed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Carmichael</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , said favorable market conditions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to plan more debt than necessary .
     `` However , given the changes in the market conditions that have occurred since then , we decided to sell only the amount needed to proceed with our contemplated recapitalization , '' he said .
     Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's original bank credit agreement , it was required to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</NUMEX> of subordinated debt to be used to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn to redeem <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 526.3 million</NUMEX> of increasing rate debentures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A month ago</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> filed to sell debt , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had planned to offer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 3\/4 %</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> in senior subordinated floating-rate notes were targeted to be offered at a price to float <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> percentage points above the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> LIBOR .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , however , market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted to be offered at a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 %</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmichael</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> also demanded stricter convenants .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Cablevision Inc.</ENAMEX> , via <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> , priced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> of junk bonds at par to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 7\/8 %</NUMEX> .
     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.C. Penney & Co.</ENAMEX> issued <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> of securities backed by credit-card receivables .
     The securities were priced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.1875</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.19 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Underwriters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.C. Penney</ENAMEX> credit-card securities are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> average life , which is much longer than previous such issues .
     Elsewhere , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 18\/32</NUMEX> bid , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/32</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> , to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.333 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life assumption .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1\/2 %</NUMEX> issue was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 20\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/32</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 7\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> .
     On the pricing front , an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-class issue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Remic mortgage securities was launched by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     The offering is backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> issue with a weighted average term to maturity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">29.583 months</TIMEX> .
     Municipal Issues
     Municipal bonds were little changed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point higher in late dealings .
     `` We were oversold and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> we bounced back .
     Some accounts came in for some blocks in the secondary -LCB- market -RCB- , which we have n't seen for a while , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     `` There were no -LCB- sell -RCB- lists and the calendar is lightening up a bit .
     There 's light at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tunnel</ENAMEX> for municipals , '' he said , adding that he expects prices to `` inch up '' in the near term .
     The market 's tone improved after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's pricing of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 813 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> general obligation bonds .
     The issue 's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     Demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> to trim some yields in the tax-exempt portion of the offering late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75.1 million</NUMEX> offering of wastewater treatment bonds by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust</ENAMEX> was more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> sold by late in the session , according to lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
     The debt was reoffered priced to yield from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.15 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2008-2009</TIMEX> .
     Foreign Bonds
     Most foreign government bonds markets were quiet .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> bonds firmed a bit after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's fall , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the market remains bearish due to speculation that interest rates could rise again .
     In a speech given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> but released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Schlesinger</ENAMEX> suggested that it was risky to claim that the booming <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> economy has reached the peak of its cycle .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Department of Consumer Affairs</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newmark & Lewis Inc.</ENAMEX> with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices .
     In a civil suit commenced in state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have `` lowered every price on every item '' as part of an advertising campaign that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> said it monitored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newmark & Lewis</ENAMEX> 's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign , and found that the prices of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50</NUMEX> different items either increased or stayed the same .
     In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newmark & Lewis</ENAMEX> announced a plan to cut prices <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 20 %</NUMEX> and eliminate what it called a `` standard discount-retailing practice '' of negotiating individual deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     The consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> also disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newmark & Lewis</ENAMEX> 's continuing strategy of advertising `` new lower prices '' when allgedly there have n't been price reductions since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D.

' ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> marked price tags and advertised at its `` lowest possible prices '' for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Consumer Affairs</ENAMEX> department `` volumes of documents '' to substantiate its statements , and made `` every effort to comply '' with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's policies .

     Wary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have been running for the stock market 's equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bomb shelters</ENAMEX> , buying shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX>-mining and utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a dozen</NUMEX> common stocks hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> highs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX>-mining issues , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another four</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a mere seven</NUMEX> common stocks managed new highs , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">golds</ENAMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> seem strange bedfellows .
     After all , gold prices usually soar when inflation is high .
     Utility stocks , on the other hand , thrive on disinflation , because the fat dividends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> pay look more attractive when prices are falling -LRB- or rising slowly -RRB- .
     But the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> have something very important in common : They are both havens for scared money , stocks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who hate stocks .
     It 's as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few days</TIMEX> , are betting that something is going to go wrong -- even if they do n't know what .
     If the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on firmer footing , these stocks might well fall back .
     Indeed , that happened to some extent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry .
     Still , a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares .
     `` The primary overriding thing is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are frightened , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sass</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     `` The aftershocks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> -LRB- when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average dropped 190 points -RRB- are still reverberating . ''
     Certainly , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> sell-off did n't settle any stomachs .
     Beyond that , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> see other problems .
     Inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are idling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     Takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market 's cart .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's unsettled political scene also worries some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` The gyrations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hoffman</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">world</ENAMEX> is getting chewed up pretty bad . ''
     `` If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> does not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term interest rates over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next 30 days</TIMEX> , the market 's going to flounder , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Wachtel</ENAMEX> , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX> .
     With this sort of sentiment common , it 's natural for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to seek out `` defensive '' investments .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Utilities</ENAMEX> are a classic example : Even in recessions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate .
     Such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have been in favor for some time .
     But many of these stocks have now become expensive .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachtel</ENAMEX> points to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> as examples : They 're selling for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 to 22</NUMEX> times estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> per-share earnings .
     Gold stocks are n't cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> times earnings or more .
     Even utility stocks are n't all that inexpensive , at an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> times earnings .
     But the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups represent a further step in defensiveness .
     If gold stocks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times .
     That 's just what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Granville</ENAMEX> expects .
     `` We are going to explode lower , '' says the flamboyant market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seer</ENAMEX> , who had a huge following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> back .
     `` Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible .
     You do n't want to own anything long except gold stocks . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for his gloom is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows .
     Last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> hit new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-month</TIMEX> lows .
     But by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville</ENAMEX> 's count , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">493</NUMEX> issues were within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point of such lows .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stovall</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stovall\/Twenty-First Securities</ENAMEX> , has money in both gold and utility issues .
     `` I think we could very well have -LCB- an economic -RCB- slowdown , beginning very soon if not already , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovall</ENAMEX> does n't expect an actual recession .
     But he does expect `` a muffler dragger '' of an economy , with `` very slow growth , maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one quarter</TIMEX> of no growth at all . ''
     In such a climate , utility stocks look good to him .
     He favors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FPL Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida Progress Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TECO Energy Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wisconsin Energy Corp.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dominion Resources Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The appeal of gold issues , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovall</ENAMEX> says , is that `` they 're a counter group .
     You go into them because they move counter to the general market . ''
     He adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were `` ready for a bounce . ''
     His favorites are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Barrick Resources Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Echo Bay Mines Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Nevertheless , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovall</ENAMEX> emphasizes that `` you do n't buy -LCB- gold stocks -RCB- based on powerful fundamentals . ''
     In addition to having high price-earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any .
     `` The earning power -LCB- of gold mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -RCB- is restricted unless the gold price hops up over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 425</NUMEX> an ounce , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Cohen</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> .
     `` My outlook is for a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> in corporate profits '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , she says .
     But `` a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> '' should post profit increases .
     Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> currently favors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Entergy Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Public Utilities Corp .</ENAMEX>
     As for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> , she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak , as it has been lately .
     Among gold stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> likes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Battle Mountain Gold Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newmont Gold Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co .</ENAMEX>

     It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">world</ENAMEX> 's environmental problems -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone Policy ?</ENAMEX> '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Melloan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business World</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 24</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     To suggest that a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ozone</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the middle of the next century</TIMEX> would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted .
     Consider the fact that a mere <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ozone</ENAMEX> would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure .
     Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish .
     The reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> `` do n't mind seeing new crises arise '' is because there are new crises .
     Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> .
     If you are doubtful , consider for a moment that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Pomton Lakes Reservoirs</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , which supply the tristate area with drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> , are riddled with toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">PCBs</ENAMEX> .
     This is a fact and not the product of some environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doomsayer</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's ploy to create a market .
     It 's time business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral , symbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> within nature 's workings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark T. Kuiper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jersey City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melloan</ENAMEX> 's column was right on the money , but I wish it could have gone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step further .
     As an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> of a major refrigerator and freezer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> , I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory -LRB- named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX> contributed to the depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ozone</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">earth</ENAMEX> 's atmosphere -RRB- and the Montreal Protocol .
     An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> facing major changes in product design .
     In my research , I have found a paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Scotto</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> reporting an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">11-year</TIMEX> decrease in UV-B radiation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> measurement sites .
     Our concern for the ozone layer , of course , grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation , which could damage <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> .
     The last of the measurements reported was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , but recent conversations with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scotto</ENAMEX> indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend .
     I understand , but have n't yet verified , that there are studies by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Norwegians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Max Planck Institute</ENAMEX> that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface .
     To me , this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX> replacement effort .
     This , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written .
     My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Resources Institute</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Resource Development Commission</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Friends of the Earth</ENAMEX> , etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited .
     When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study , I was urged to get back to the agenda topic , which was , ironically , a schedule for getting rid of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">HCFCs</ENAMEX> , the so-called soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario .
     Subsequently , I have learned that a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> is a part , is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scotto</ENAMEX> report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments .
     But this is almost an underground activity .
     To my knowledge , no government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">entities</ENAMEX> , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> , are pursuing UV-B measurements .
     The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion `` establishment '' meetings , of which I have attended many .
     It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> .
     While recognizing that professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> may feel threatened , I intend to urge that UV-B be monitored whenever I can .

     The relationship between surface release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> .
     Although , like all scientific theories , it had its initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> , few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> question the connection now .
     The discovery of the ozone `` hole '' over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Antarctica</ENAMEX> and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations .

     He is a mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> , not an atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> .
     It is insulting and demeaning to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> `` needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts '' and that environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> need them to stay in business .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rifenburgh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Longmont</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo.</ENAMEX> , disk-drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , also said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> continued losing money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> and expects to sustain further losses through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rifenburgh</ENAMEX> told industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> he is moving `` aggressively '' to negotiate out-of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits , but noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">company</ENAMEX> could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rifenburgh</ENAMEX> also noted that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150 million</NUMEX> shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MiniScribe</ENAMEX> common stock were traded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> , `` so there 's a tremendous amount of exposure .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MiniScribe</ENAMEX> has said that its financial results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three fiscal years</TIMEX> would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MiniScribe</ENAMEX> also has n't filed any financial statements for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rifenburgh</ENAMEX> said such statements should be ready by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of November</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MiniScribe</ENAMEX> report outlines a host of allegedly fraudulent practices , including the shipment of bricks and defective disk drives that were booked as sales , and inventory forgeries in accounting records .

     The seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , has important implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> will be able to underwrite .
     Several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have similar applications pending .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has given a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> have challenged those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> limited the revenue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> could earn from these new underwriting activities to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 10 %</NUMEX> of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , such as dealing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> Treasurys .
     For some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> ceiling created problems .
     But , by allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BT Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> to handle private placements , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> can do .
     Private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> , that are sold to institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> and are n't registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .

     When they return to their desks at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p.m.</TIMEX> , they have pedaled <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">20 miles</NUMEX> .
     Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> build a creative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> at the forefront of its industry .
     Founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> spotted the appeal of fat-tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past five years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sales have grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 million</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , so-called mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bicycles</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of its sales coming from mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> is widely considered to be a market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Accessories , largely for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">mountain-bike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> , account for much of the rest of sales . -RRB-
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> after another is leaping into the booming market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> helped create , turning out mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> with such well-known names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schwinn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nishiki</ENAMEX> .
     Thus , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them , by developing new products specifically for mountain biking .
     At the same time , though , it must become more structured to better manage its growth .
     Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">unicycle</ENAMEX> .
     It is a problem common to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have grown fast -- especially when their success attracts big-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     `` The big word around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> is passion , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Eidsmo</ENAMEX> , a former ski-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> to run marketing and sales .
     `` What I hope to bring to this is another word : process .
     That 's my challenge .
     It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> 's challenge as well . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eidsmo</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of several key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free-wheeling , fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> under tighter control .
     `` We had a lot of problems , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> says .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sales were soaring , `` We still had a system that was probably appropriate for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million to $ 20 million</NUMEX> in sales . ''
     Adds Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eidsmo</ENAMEX> , `` What felt good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> was done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> . ''
     Since his arrival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eidsmo</ENAMEX> has put in place techniques learned while working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> , such as management-by-objective , detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends .
     `` We 're finally getting -- and it 's been very painful -- some understanding of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's long-term horizon should begin to look like , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eidsmo</ENAMEX> says .
     `` But it 's risky , '' he says of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> 's attempt to adopt a corporate structure .
     `` You do n't want to lose the magic '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's creative drive .
     Hoping to stay ahead of the pack , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is emphasizing innovation .
     At a recent trade show , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convention-goers</ENAMEX> lined up to view a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> bike frame that weighs just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">2.7 pounds</NUMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a pound</NUMEX> less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market .
     By replacing the frame 's steel lugs with titanium ones , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter .
     At the trade show , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> also unveiled a revolutionary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-spoked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> wheel developed jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont Co .</ENAMEX>
     Made of space-age materials , the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> off the time of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rider</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">100-mile</NUMEX> race , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> claims .
     It currently costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750</NUMEX> , though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> thinks the price can be reduced within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 200 and $ 250</NUMEX> .
     He was able to slash the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's least expensive mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 279</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750</NUMEX> in
     But demands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's creativity are certain to grow .
     Competition is intensifying as larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> invade a mountain-bike market Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> once had virtually all to itself .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">U.S. Cycling Federation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Milburn</ENAMEX> says mountain biking is `` growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are getting into this . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> especially coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> market the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> are targeting is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">mountain-bike</ENAMEX> accessories , which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eidsmo</ENAMEX> calls `` the future of our business . ''
     Accessories not only sell faster than whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> , they also offer profit margins nearly double the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 % to 30 %</NUMEX> or so on sales of complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cycles</ENAMEX> .
     To get a piece of the business , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nike Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beaverton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore.</ENAMEX> , introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">About a month ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michelin Tire Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C.</ENAMEX> , began selling mountain-bike tires , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> stronghold .
     Competition in the sale of complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> is heating up too .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trek Bicycle Corp.</ENAMEX> , which accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-quarter</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intrepid Corp.</ENAMEX> , entered the mountain-bike business in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trek</ENAMEX> previously made only traditional road <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> , but `` it did n't take a rocket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> to change a road <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> into a mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bike</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Burke</ENAMEX> .
     The segment now makes up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly two-thirds</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's total sales .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Giant Bicycle Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rancho Dominguez</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , sales have tripled since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> mountain-bike business in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schwinn Bicycle Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , established joint ventures with bike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bikes</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Derby International Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Luxembourg</ENAMEX> , has acquired such major brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nishiki</ENAMEX> .
     In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinyard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is replacing independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributors</ENAMEX> overseas with wholly owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> .
     The move will cut out the cost of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">middleman</ENAMEX> and give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> more control over marketing and sales .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Austin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Giant</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , puts it , `` With some of the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> consolidating their strength , the game has changed .

     And we 'll raise it through existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> '' as well as through junk bonds , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Simonds-Gooding</ENAMEX> , the private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     He said he believes the bank loan , to be arranged by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> , will supply <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the financing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Satellite</ENAMEX> , which already has raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 423.5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> , initially expected to seek <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional # 400 million</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simonds-Gooding</ENAMEX> said the additional financing may leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Satellite</ENAMEX> owned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> , whose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 36 %</NUMEX> stake would be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 20 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Satellite</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> , would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have speculated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios</ENAMEX> might buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond</ENAMEX> stake .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simonds-Gooding</ENAMEX> said he is n't talking to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studios</ENAMEX> about investing .
     Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Satellite</ENAMEX> 's other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">backers</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pearson PLC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reed International PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Granada Group PLC .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> faced a setback in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> when technical problems forced it to postpone the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> launch until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> .
     Continued uncertainty about the timing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> 's debut could make it hard to find a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 450 million</NUMEX> cash injection .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simonds-Gooding</ENAMEX> conceded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Satellite</ENAMEX> 's potential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> `` are saying , ` When you 're on the air , you 'll -LCB- actually -RCB- get the money . ' ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> also insist that the loans depend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> raising more money from new and existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">backers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Satellite</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> is unveiling a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 30 million</NUMEX> advertising and promotional drive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> 's planned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> channels of movies , sports , entertainment and news shows .
     As part of the drive , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> who put up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 10</NUMEX> each will get a package valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 170</NUMEX> -- including a satellite receiving dish , equipment installation and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> subscription to its pay-movie service .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks posted a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-consecutive loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , while trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , was mixed .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index finished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.1</NUMEX> points higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2112.2</NUMEX> .
     The index settled off the high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2117.1</NUMEX> posted after Wall Street opened stronger .
     But it showed strength throughout the session , hitting a low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2102.2</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few minutes</TIMEX> of dealings .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-share index settled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.2</NUMEX> points higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1701.7</NUMEX> .
     Volume was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 256.6 million</NUMEX> shares , breaking the previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">276.8 million</NUMEX> shares recorded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 23</TIMEX> .
     Turnover was also down substantially from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">840.8 million</NUMEX> shares on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market was supported to some extent by a firmer pound , gains on Wall Street and shopping by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market-makers</ENAMEX> to cover internal requirements for selected stocks in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> attributed most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's gains to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market-makers</ENAMEX> moving prices higher , rather than an outbreak of significant buying interest .
     Prices were up across the board , with most blue-chip stocks registering solid gains .
     Though the market was stronger , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said fresh buying interest was sidelined ahead of a potential market-affecting debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Commons</ENAMEX> set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     It will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance before the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor Party</ENAMEX> .
     The market is keenly interested in hearing what he has to say about the status of the current <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> base lending rate .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Courtaulds</ENAMEX> , a chemicals and textiles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , increased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 pence</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">362</NUMEX> after it disclosed plans to spin off its textiles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> into a separately listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1</TIMEX> .
     It was the most active of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3 million</NUMEX> shares , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5 million</NUMEX> of which were traded by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">747</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said fresh buying was drawn into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler-Benz</ENAMEX> , the auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , told a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> held talks with the luxury auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> over possible joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler</ENAMEX> has said it is n't interested in mounting a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said its name further underlined the growing interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX> was the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gainer</ENAMEX> , jumping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13.78</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.72</NUMEX> -RRB- on anticipation of a stock split <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , who took profits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , mostly took a wait-and-see attitude <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> amid uncertainty in the foreign-currency market and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takamori Matsuda</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner-ABD Securities</ENAMEX> , said fading expectation for lower interest rates made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> step back from real-estate shares , which advanced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> were waiting to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> jobless rate to be issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.82</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.16</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.19 %</NUMEX> , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2676.60</NUMEX> .
     The Second Section index , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36.87</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.44</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.59 %</NUMEX> , to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3636.06</NUMEX> .
     Second Section volume was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 million</NUMEX> shares , down from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.5 million</NUMEX> shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's losers included railway , electric-utility and high-technology issues .
     The energy of participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> streamed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu Group</ENAMEX> shares , pushing prices of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> up across the board .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu Group</ENAMEX> announced during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will buy the others ' stocks to defend themselves against a rumored takeover .

     Other winners <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> included nonferrous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> , which attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> because of a surge in gold prices on the back of the unstable dollar .
     Petroleum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> were also popular because of expectations of a weaker dollar , which cuts dollar-denominated crude-oil prices .
     Share prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> closed narrowly mixed after listless and directionless trading .
     The DAX index closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1466.29</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3.36</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said turnover was particularly thin as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> waited for Wall Street to set the direction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> .
     Most expect the decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stock prices to continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     Another factor weighing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> market involves fears about the impending wage talks between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IG Metall</ENAMEX> metal-workers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">union</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> , which could result in a wave of strikes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .

     Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> .

     The percentage change is since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> .
