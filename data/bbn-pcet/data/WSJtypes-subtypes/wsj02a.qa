     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> are appealing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool , individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money managers</ENAMEX> contend .
     They make the argument in letters to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> about rule changes proposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past summer</TIMEX> that , among other things , would exempt many middle-management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> from reporting trades in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' shares .
     The proposed changes also would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to report exercises of options later and less often .
     Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> stock market crash -- and the markets already so stacked against the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> -- that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to get out of stocks altogether .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field , '' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clyde S. McGregor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Winnetka</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> letters the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> has received since the changes were proposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 17</TIMEX> .
     `` Apparently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> did not really believe in this ideal . ''
     Currently , the rules force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and other corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> to report purchases and sales of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' shares within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a month</TIMEX> after the transaction .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> figures , file their reports late .
     The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> `` who are really calling the shots , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Lane</ENAMEX> , special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corporate officials</ENAMEX> had until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> will probably vote on the proposal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> , he said .
     Not all those who wrote oppose the changes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> argues , for example , in its lengthy letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> , that the proposed changes `` would substantially improve the -LCB- law -RCB- by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities . ''
     What the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a short period of time</TIMEX> .
     According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">more than a third</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> vehemently disputed those estimates .
     The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> said .
     The proposed rules also would be tougher on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> still required to file reports , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> would be compelled to publish in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> proxy statements the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> who fail to file reports on time .
     Considered as a whole , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> said , the filings required under the proposed rules `` will be at least as effective , if not more so , for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> following transactions . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gabele</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Invest\/Net</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">North Miami</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that packages and sells the insider-trading data , said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> may fail to file the reports .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> wrote asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> to require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> to report their purchases and sales immediately , not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a month later</TIMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> said that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> regulates who files , the law tells them when to do so .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> who want to change the required timing should write their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , he added .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> would likely be amenable to legislation that required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> to file transactions on a more timely basis , he said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> , which oversees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 billion</NUMEX> for college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , plans to offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new investment options to its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund</ENAMEX> said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in `` socially responsible '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , and a bond fund .
     Both funds are expected to begin operation around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1</TIMEX> , subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> approval .
     For its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to sign up for the options , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> also must approve the plan .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 4,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> are part of the pension fund .
     The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     The new `` social choice '' fund will shun securities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> , nuclear power and in some cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> .
     Also excluded will be investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with `` significant '' business stemming from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> manufacture , alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beverages</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">tobacco</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Sixty percent</NUMEX> of the fund will be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments .
     The bond fund will invest in high-grade or medium-grade bonds , mortgages or asset-backed securities , including <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 %</NUMEX> in foreign securities .
     The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">New York State Insurance Department</ENAMEX> .
     Under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new features , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or , if their jobs are terminated , receive cash from the funds .
     The investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund , an annuity and a money-market fund .

     Solo woodwind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oboist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinz Holliger</ENAMEX> has taken a hard line about the problem : He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting , so he does n't have to play the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX> concertos over and over again .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Stoltzman</ENAMEX> has taken a gentler , more audience-friendly approach .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Years ago</TIMEX> , he collaborated with the new music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Serkin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Sherry</ENAMEX> in the very countercultural chamber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Tashi</ENAMEX> , which won <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> over to dreaded contemporary scores like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messiaen</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Quartet for the End of Time</ENAMEX> . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , the pixie-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clarinetist</ENAMEX> has mostly dropped the missionary work -LRB- though a touch of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Tashi</ENAMEX> still survives -RRB- and now goes on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exceptions .
     Just the thing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vivaldi</ENAMEX>-at-brunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">set</ENAMEX> , the yuppie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening .
     But you ca n't dismiss Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> 's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight .
     He believes in what he plays , and he plays superbly .
     His recent appearance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Metropolitan Museum</ENAMEX> , dubbed `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">A Musical Odyssey</ENAMEX> , '' was a case in point .
     It felt more like a party , or a highly polished jam session with a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> , than a classical concert .
     Clad in his trademark black velvet suit , the soft-spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clarinetist</ENAMEX> announced that his new album , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Inner Voices</ENAMEX> , '' had just been released , that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was in the front row , and that it was his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> 's birthday , so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record .
     He launched into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Saens</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Swan</ENAMEX> '' from `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Carnival of the Animals</ENAMEX> , '' a favorite encore piece for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cellists</ENAMEX> , with lovely , glossy tone and no bite .
     Then , as if to show that he could play fast as well , he offered the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> movement from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Saens</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sonata for Clarinet</ENAMEX> , a whimsical , puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> personality .
     And so it went through the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> , none that would disturb or challenge a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> introduced his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Douglas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bassoonist</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> and an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> , and jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bassist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Gomez</ENAMEX> .
     An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> , beginning with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Golden Rain</ENAMEX> , '' a lilting , laid-back lead in to the uptempo `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sky</ENAMEX> , '' which gave Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bach</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Air</ENAMEX> '' followed .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> tied the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> in by proclaiming him `` the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">improviser</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> , '' and then built on the image by joining with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bach</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part inventions , cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> .
     Keeping the mood light , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms , devised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> as an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hindemith</ENAMEX> 's dry theory-teaching techniques , and then , with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gomez</ENAMEX> , soared and improvised on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> 's tight `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bebop Etudes</ENAMEX> . ''
     The end of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> , however , brought what the standing-room-only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> seemed to be waiting for : the pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Collins</ENAMEX> , who appears on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Inner Voices</ENAMEX> . ''
     Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> sang <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joni Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">For Free</ENAMEX> '' -- about an encounter with a street-corner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clarinetist</ENAMEX> , to which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> 's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Deep Peace</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Deep Peace</ENAMEX> '' also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds , beaches , deserts , sunsets , etc .
     It was all too mellow to be believed , but they probably would have gotten away with it , had they not felt compelled to add Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> 's signature tune , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Amazing Grace</ENAMEX> , '' and ask for audience participation .
     That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings .
     Was this why some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> departed before or during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> ?
     Or was it because Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> had gone ?
     Either way it was a pity , because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stolzman</ENAMEX> offered the most substantial music of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> just after intermission : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Reich</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">New York Counterpoint</ENAMEX> , '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> works that juxtapose a live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> with recorded tracks of his or her own playing .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> 's new `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Different Trains</ENAMEX> '' for string quartet uses the technique magisterially . -RRB-
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> must have worried that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> might not be able to take it : He warned us in advance that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">New York Counterpoint</ENAMEX> '' lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 1\/2 minutes</TIMEX> .
     He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX> 's images , this time of geometric or repeating objects , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> 's piece and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> 's elegant execution of it .
     The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Parker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ornette Coleman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Douglas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Gomez</ENAMEX> , with pictures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> pieces .
     It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">club</ENAMEX> , but like the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> , much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable .
     Is this the future of chamber music ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenters</ENAMEX> insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell , but can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements , served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals ?
     What 's next ?
     Slides to illustrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shostakovich</ENAMEX> quartets ?
     It was not <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an unpleasant evening</TIMEX> , certainly , thanks to the high level of performance , the compositional talents of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> , and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltzman</ENAMEX> chooses his selections .
     But it was neither deep nor lasting : light entertainment that was no substitute for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX> .

     One of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> 's attributes as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for `` consensus '' in various international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , he liberated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> from one of the world 's most corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , along with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> , left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> when its anti-Western ideology , financial corruption and top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> got out of hand .
     The personal antics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow</ENAMEX> drew much attention , such as when several of his top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> were uncovered as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">KGB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and ejected from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and when a mysterious office fire was set just before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> to trace <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> funds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M'Bow</ENAMEX> was an extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case</ENAMEX> , but even his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> , the more personally genial <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biochemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Mayor</ENAMEX> , has had little success at achieving reforms .
     Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else 's statism .
     The Orwellian `` New World Information Order '' would give government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> rights against the press ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> would be obliged to kowtow to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , which would have licensing and censorship powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> somehow converted the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX> ideals of individual rights and liberty into `` peoples ' rights . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Million-dollar</NUMEX> conferences were held to chew on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> in support of disarmament '' and `` the impact of the activities of transnational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> wonder about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> that seemed so congenial to them .
     Glasnost may be partly responsible , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> admitted , `` The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> is now holding its biennial meetings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> to devise its next projects .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor</ENAMEX> 's hope that references to `` press freedom '' would survive unamended seems doomed to failure ; the current phrasing is `` educating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and media to avoid manipulation . ''
     He has n't been able to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M'Bow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cabal</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> remain in charge of education programs , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">tribunal</ENAMEX> for executions is in charge of culture , and a hard-line <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">communist</ENAMEX> in exile directs the human-rights and peace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">division</ENAMEX> .
     Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,750</NUMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> are in the field working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research .
     The position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> , which once contributed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> of the budget , is that nothing has changed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bolton</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary of state</ENAMEX> for international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> , told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> that the continuing `` statist , restrictive , nondemocratic '' programs make rejoining any time soon `` extremely unlikely . ''
     This has n't much bothered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> , who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chateau</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> somehow owns .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , may have a hard time justifying continued membership .
     We see an even stronger argument against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> than its unsurprising failure to reform .
     This is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Reagan Revolution</ENAMEX> spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> or government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionaries</ENAMEX> .
     Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> -- which of course are made up largely of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> that fear these principles at home .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Babelists</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Nations</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> at obfuscation .
     This can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice .
     We can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to rejoin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UNESCO</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plant Genetic Systems N.V.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Belgium</ENAMEX> said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> for a number of key <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollen</ENAMEX> .
     The gene thus can prevent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> from fertilizing itself .
     Such so-called male-sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> , thereby producing hybrid seed .
     The new generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> will possess the flourishing , high-production trait known as `` hybrid vigor , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> .
     `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Robinson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta &amp; Pine Land Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwide Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> that is one of the largest cotton seed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and sorghum feed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grains</ENAMEX> .
     That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> .
     In a labor-intensive process , the seed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> cut off the tassels of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> , making it male sterile .
     They sow a row of male-fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> .
     The first hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and they yielded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 %</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> than naturally pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> .
     The vast majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> now is grown from hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds</ENAMEX> produced by seed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> .
     The male part , the anthers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> , and the female , the pistils , of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> are within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a fraction of an inch</NUMEX> or even attached to each other .
     The anthers in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> are difficult to clip off .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , a great number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are engaged in pulling out the male organs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> using tweezers , and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> produced in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> is grown from hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plant Genetic Systems</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> to confer male sterility .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Leemans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">research director</ENAMEX> , said this gene was successfully introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">oil</ENAMEX>-producing rapeseed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Goldberg</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California in Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leemans</ENAMEX> said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> also pulled off a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> .
     They attached a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gene , for herbicide resistance , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollen</ENAMEX>-inhibiting gene .
     Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seed</ENAMEX> .
     The laws of heredity dictate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> springing from these greenhouse-produced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds</ENAMEX> will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible .
     The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> , leaving a large field of male-sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seed</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leemans</ENAMEX> said the hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rapeseeds</ENAMEX> created with this genetic engineering yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 30 %</NUMEX> more output than the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used currently .
     `` This technique is applicable to a wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> , '' he said , and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is experimenting with the technique on <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">alfalfa</ENAMEX> , and plans to include <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> , among other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> .
     He said that even though virtually all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds</ENAMEX> currently planted are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> , the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers , which costs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> seed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 70 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Oil Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     One technique developed by some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollen</ENAMEX> .
     But there have been problems with chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">sprays</ENAMEX> damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">sprays</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and beneficial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Johanson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of plant sciences , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">spray</ENAMEX> overcomes these problems and is `` gentle on the female organ . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Biosource Genetics Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vacaville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , is developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">spray</ENAMEX> containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollen</ENAMEX> .
     This gene , called `` gametocide , '' is carried into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> by a virus that remains active for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few days</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Erwin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Biosource</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plant Genetic</ENAMEX> 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` complementary rather than competitive . ''
     `` There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta &amp; Pine</ENAMEX> , the seed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scott</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Miss.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plant Genetic</ENAMEX> 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops .
     That 's because pollination , while easy in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carriers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     Nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plant Genetic</ENAMEX> to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> .

     A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the world 's most powerful financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's once-cozy financial circles .
     Not only are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they 're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion .
     Already , the consequences are being felt by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> in the financial markets -- even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> .
     What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> bond issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> was attempting to organize the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 billion-yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 352 million</NUMEX> -RRB- borrowing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> at a time when many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> , were pressuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> that had been owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> 's civil-service pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> .
     Unwilling to put up new money for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> until those debts are repaid , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> to postpone it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     The dispute shows clearly the global power of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">titans</ENAMEX> .
     Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> 's injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Debt Management Office</ENAMEX> had been casting abroad to raise the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 billion New Zealand dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- US$ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.76 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NZ$ 4 billion</NUMEX> it needs to come up with by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of its fiscal year next June 30</TIMEX> .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's cash-flush <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> aligned against it , though , raising money may be difficult .
     Not only can they block <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> from raising money in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> here say , but as the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> in the Eurobond market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> 's finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Caygill</ENAMEX> , lashed out at such suggestions .
     He told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> had n't guaranteed the loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DFC New Zealand Ltd.</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>-owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Provident Fund</ENAMEX> , and would n't bail it out .
     `` It may very well be what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> want , '' he told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Radio New Zealand</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> or any other international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">interests</ENAMEX> . ''
     No less significant than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> are the implications of a confrontation between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> securities and banking industries .
     Anxiety is rising over recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> industries from each other .
     Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business .
     Meanwhile , the securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- most of them smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> , the world 's biggest securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> largely by virtue of its protected home field , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's most innovative and aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> in capital markets abroad , captain the opposing sides .
     And their suspicions of each other run deep .

     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX> might say , it 's deja vu all over again .
     Crouched at shortstop , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Campaneris</ENAMEX> , once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> 's master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX> , effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> .

     On the mound , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Sox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Tiant</ENAMEX> , the wily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,001</NUMEX> moves , throws an off-speed strike .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Babies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kiddies</ENAMEX> , '' growls their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> -- a fellow named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Weaver</ENAMEX> , who , in a different time , handled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> and now handles the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Gold Coast Suns</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old-time kiddies</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     Perhaps .
     But for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months</TIMEX> , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summers long past</TIMEX> are going to be reveling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an Indian summer</TIMEX> of the soul .
     Now that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the baseball season</TIMEX> is officially over , you see , it 's time for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a new season</TIMEX> to begin .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> is the debut of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Senior Professional Baseball Association</ENAMEX> , a new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-team pro sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">circuit</ENAMEX> , modeled after the highly successful <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">senior tennis and golf tours</ENAMEX> and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and ninety two</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greats</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">near greats</ENAMEX> , hardly knowns and unknowns begin a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>-game , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month season</TIMEX> in spring-training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadiums</ENAMEX> up and down <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
     For everyone involved , it 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more swig of that elixir of youth , <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> .
     `` Someone always makes you quit , '' says legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">St. Louis Cardinals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centerfielder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curt Flood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">the league</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> .

     Until the baby-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> reclaim these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballparks</ENAMEX> for spring training , there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more .
     And not just for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> .
     It 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more for the baseball-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> and real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> who ponied up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 million</NUMEX> each for the chance to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , to step into the shoes of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Autry</ENAMEX> or have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rollie Fingers</ENAMEX> . `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Sider</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">West Palm Beach Tropics</ENAMEX> .
     Early in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sider</ENAMEX> , an estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , pores over last wills and testaments .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Midmorning</TIMEX> , he dons an orange-and-blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Kingman</ENAMEX> .
     It 's one more , too , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> who dream of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a season that never ends</TIMEX> .
     `` I feel like a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> , '' says a gleeful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex de Castro</ENAMEX> , a car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> , who has stopped by a workout of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Suns</ENAMEX> to slip <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campaneris</ENAMEX> cards to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Great Man Himself</ENAMEX> to be autographed .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> will join die-hard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Castro</ENAMEX> and pack the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands</ENAMEX> to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">brainchild</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado</ENAMEX> real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Morley</ENAMEX> -- once a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minor-leaguer</ENAMEX> himself -- who says he had the idea <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last January</TIMEX> while lying on a beach in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> .
     When he sent letters offering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,250</NUMEX> retired major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaguers</ENAMEX> the chance of another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">730</NUMEX> responded .
     Eventually , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 250</NUMEX> made the trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> to compete for the available slots .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Players</ENAMEX> have to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">35 or older</TIMEX> , except for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catchers</ENAMEX> , who are eligible at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">32</TIMEX> because life behind the plate is so rough . -RRB-
     For some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> , the lure is money -- up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> a month .
     Others , just released from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">majors</ENAMEX> , hope the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> will be their bridge back into the big-time .
     But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seasons past</TIMEX> or prove to themselves and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> that they still have it -- or something close to it .
     `` My fastball is good .
     Real good , '' says <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">39-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Broberg</ENAMEX> , working in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> heat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Tropics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">camp</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broberg</ENAMEX> , who started with the now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Washington Senators</ENAMEX> , says that when he left <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> , he `` never looked back . ''
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a long time</TIMEX> , he ignored <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> altogether , even the sports pages .
     Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broberg</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , claims he 'd play for free .
     `` You ca n't give it up that easily , '' he says .
     `` I tried . ''
     The nagging memory of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one afternoon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourteen years ago</TIMEX> drove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Gideon</ENAMEX> , a lean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">36-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">righthander</ENAMEX> to take a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-month</TIMEX> leave from selling insurance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> to try out for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> .
     `` It does n't replace pitching in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">majors</ENAMEX> , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says .
     Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> , late in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season</TIMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">then-21</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gideon</ENAMEX> made his only major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> appearance , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> innings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago White Sox</ENAMEX> .
     He gave up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hits , walked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and did n't get a decision .
     Arm troubles forced him back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> .
     `` There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules , '' offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will McEnaney</ENAMEX> , once a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stopper</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Big Red Machine</ENAMEX> .
     He means the rule that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> ca n't cut it after a certain age .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">These days</TIMEX> he hustles to house-painting jobs in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">pickup</ENAMEX> before and after training with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Tropics</ENAMEX> .
     While sipping a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> after practice , he vividly recounts getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Sox</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Yastrzemski</ENAMEX> to pop out to end the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">1975 World Series</ENAMEX> , and repeating the feat against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Yankees</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy White</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> .
     Some of the game 's reigning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> dislike the idea of middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> attempting a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> 's sport .
     `` I personally do n't enjoy seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> who I remember vividly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">their playing days</TIMEX> running about and being gallant about their deficiencies , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Angell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> 's resident baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> .
     `` I feel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should be allowed to remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> as they were . ''
     Worse , says baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ritter</ENAMEX> , `` Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story . ''
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ballplayers</ENAMEX> disagree .
     Most are trim .
     Some have been training for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> ; others only recently left active status .
     -LRB- No one has worked out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> ' average age , but most appear to be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">their late 30s</TIMEX> . -RRB-
     And there 's pride .
     `` I 'm not going to look stupid , '' vows former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pittsburgh Pirate</ENAMEX> second <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baseman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie Stennett</ENAMEX> , sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings .
     `` It 's going to be a tough <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> , '' promises the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">47-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campaneris</ENAMEX> .
     `` There will be a lot of malice . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> who have played hard all their lives are n't about to change their habits , he says .
     Nonetheless , one ca n't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower .
     At the weatherbeaten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pompano Beach</ENAMEX> municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">45-year-old</TIMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oriole</ENAMEX> , knows his power is n't what it used to be .
     So he adjusts .
     He no longer crowds the plate .
     He 's not thinking about home runs anymore , just base hits .
     Still , `` how sweet it is , '' he says , savoring the fat sound of the well-hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall .
     And do n't expect many complete games by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> -- perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX> , laughs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fingers</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reliever</ENAMEX> .
     Expect `` tricky '' stuff from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     Expect brushbacks but no beanballs , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McEnaney</ENAMEX> .
     Even expect stolen bases , says the wiry and fit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campaneris</ENAMEX> : `` If you know how to slide , it 's no problem , '' he says .
     And expect slower fastballs .
     `` I 'm not so young anymore , '' concedes the cigar-chomping , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">48-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiant</ENAMEX> .
     `` I wo n't be throwing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">90 mph</NUMEX> , but I will throw <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">80-plus</NUMEX> , '' he says .
     White-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Ramos</ENAMEX> , at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">54</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> 's oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher-coach</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Suns</ENAMEX> , has lost even more speed .
     Stuffing a wad of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Red Man</ENAMEX> into his cheek , he admits the fastball he brought into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">majors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1955</TIMEX> has become a slowball .
     Its maximum velocity is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">72 mph</NUMEX> .
     But he is n't worried .
     He will compensate with the guile learned from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">majors</ENAMEX> .
     He has good control .
     He will keep the ball down , move it around .

     In a surprise move , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> cleared the way for a bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">auto maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Ridley</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Commons</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that he will relinquish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's so-called golden share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> agree .
     The golden share restricts any individual holding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> and expires at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1990</TIMEX> .
     It was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's best interests `` for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> 's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">luxury-car maker</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> have been trying to amass <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , which already has an unwelcome <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.2 %</NUMEX> holding , is prepared to bid for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and had lobbied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to lift the takeover restrictions early .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> has been negotiating a friendly transaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> that likely would involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">joint ventures</ENAMEX> and an eventual stake of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 30 %</NUMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's action , which caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> flat-footed , may scuttle the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> .
     `` I ca n't believe they -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> -RRB- will let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> have a free run , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> auto industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew</ENAMEX> .
     `` I am sure they will be going for a full bid . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> certainly believe a bidding war is imminent .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares skyrocketed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London 's Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     In late trading , the shares were up a whopping <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">122 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.93</NUMEX> -RRB- -- a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.3 %</NUMEX> gain -- to a record <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">869 pence</NUMEX> on very heavy volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7 million</NUMEX> shares .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares trading as American Depositary Receipts closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.625</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.75</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> will make the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> move , perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , with an initial offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 900 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.25</NUMEX> -RRB- a share .
     Such a proposal values <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> at more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.6 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.53 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     Speculation about a takeover fight has sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares soaring in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past six weeks</TIMEX> .
     The share price was languishing at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 400 pence</NUMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 19</TIMEX> announcement of its interest in a minority stake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is `` in the driving seat at the moment , '' observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Barber</ENAMEX> , an auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     An aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> would put pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> to make a better offer as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">white knight</ENAMEX> . ''
     Such a countermove could end <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's hopes for remaining independent and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-owned .
     But it is n't clear how long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> would be willing to fight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> .
     Because of their longstanding rivalry , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> just `` wants to make sure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> pays a huge packet for -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> -RRB- , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lawson</ENAMEX> , an auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> talks agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> now may be able to shut out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's either going to be a shootout , or there only may be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> in town , '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> said .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> close to the talks said , `` It is very hard to justify paying a silly price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> if an out-and-out bidding war were to start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> . ''
     In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> said they `` were not consulted about the -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> decision -RRB- in advance and were surprised at the action taken . ''
     The statement emphasized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> of the shares voting at a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> , now has the power to call for such a meeting .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> also noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is in the best position to benefit from the large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares that have moved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past month</TIMEX> into the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> waiting for the highest takeover bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> add , because <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 3 %</NUMEX> of its shares are owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's action or on any plans to call a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> meeting .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> approval to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 15 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's stock , it has n't yet disclosed how many shares it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> owns .
     In a prepared statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> suggested its plans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> might reap from a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> bid .
     `` Our intensive discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , at their invitation , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> said , `` have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> that would provide for the continued independence of this great <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , to ensure a secure future for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and to provide an attractive long-term return for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> was shocked by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> 's decision , because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> had believed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would n't lift the golden share without consulting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> first .
     Indeed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is taking a calculated risk .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> 's announcement set off a howl of protests from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor Party</ENAMEX> , who accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> of backing down on promised protection for a privatized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> retained the single golden share after selling its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> in
     The Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election , expected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1991</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with , '' observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Jones</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of motor industry management at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Cardiff</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Wales</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy , has been badly hurt by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's shake-up in Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cabinet</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> did n't want to appear to favor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> hinted at this motive in answering questions from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> after his announcement .
     He said he was giving up the golden share `` to clear the way so the playing field is level between all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contestants</ENAMEX> . ''
