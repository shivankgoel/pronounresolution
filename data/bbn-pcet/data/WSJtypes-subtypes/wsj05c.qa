     The world had a big yuk recently when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> reported a rash of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFO</ENAMEX> landings , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them bringing tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who glowed in the dark to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Voronezh</ENAMEX> .
     It is the opinion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Good</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Above Top Secret : The World UFO Cover-Up</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quill\/William Morrow</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">592</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.95</NUMEX> -RRB- , that the world laughs too fast .
     Here is a bible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> , complete with pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who say they 've had personal relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> photo shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> sporting a scar she says was made by a laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">beam</ENAMEX> -LRB- a low-caliber <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapon</ENAMEX> , from the looks of the wound -RRB- .
     So far anyway , our alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> seem more intent on brightening our skies than pulverizing us .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> devotes much serious space to the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Feb. 25 , 1942</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunners</ENAMEX> spotted strange lights in the sky above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     Air-raid sirens sounded the alarm at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:25 a.m.</TIMEX> , summoning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wardens</ENAMEX> to duty .
     Soon all hell broke loose .
     Ground batteries , targeting an odd assortment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> traveling at highly unusual speeds , opened up a furious fusillade .
     The sky filled with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">12.8-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">shells</ENAMEX> , several of which fell back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> , destroying <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> .
     When the smoke cleared , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were dead -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> , who documents these things as best he can , provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George C. Marshall</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> : `` <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">1,430 pounds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ammunition</ENAMEX> , '' he wrote his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander in chief</ENAMEX> , were expended on `` unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> , '' flying at speeds as slow as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">200 mph</NUMEX> and elevations <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">between 9,000 and 18,000 feet</NUMEX> .
     Well , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> on the scene insisted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ammo</ENAMEX> had been uselessly aimed at a large , hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFO</ENAMEX> , but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> thing 's for sure : There have been <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a ton</NUMEX> of them , and greater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> have shown interest .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Ford</ENAMEX> , a fairly down-to-earth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> , once sent a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> recommending that `` there be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFO</ENAMEX> phenomenon .
     I think we owe it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to establish credibility regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFOs</ENAMEX> and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> went further in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> campaign promise : `` If I become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , I 'll make every piece of information this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> has about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFO</ENAMEX> sightings available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> .
     I am convinced that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFOs</ENAMEX> exist because I have seen one ... . ''
     But you know about campaign promises .
     It still does n't look like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> are coughing up everything they know .
     Still , despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> do seem to keep coming and , like the recent sightings , there 's often a detail or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that suggests they may actually be a little on the dumb side .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Voronezh</ENAMEX> say the pinheaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">behemoths</ENAMEX> and their robot friend , after strolling around the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> , left behind some rocks .
     Now why , you have to ask yourself , would intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> haul a bunch of rocks around the universe ?
     Or land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Russia</ENAMEX> so often .
     In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1961</TIMEX> incident , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> .
     A search <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> soon found the unscathed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing .
     What 's more , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> aboard were missing .
     Again , you have to ask the obvious question : Why would intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> kidnap <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mailmen</ENAMEX> ?
     Speculation as to the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> will no doubt continue until we wake up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX> to find they 've taken over `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Today Show</ENAMEX> , '' the way they overwhelm an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Finney</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireside\/Simon &amp; Schuster</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.95</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     Maybe some of our talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anchors</ENAMEX> have already been taken over ?
     The point of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1955</TIMEX> novel , which spawned two movies , is that the soulless pod <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who thinks they 're out there and closing fast is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitley Strieber</ENAMEX> , whose new novel , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Majestic</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Putnam</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">317</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- , takes a look at a reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1947</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">UFO</ENAMEX> crash near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Roswell Army Air Field</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> desert .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strieber</ENAMEX> knows a lot about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> .
     He even had sex with one -- sort of , and not intentionally -- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> learned in his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Communion</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- a book recently described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> as a `` nonfiction best seller '' -RRB- .
     The way Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strieber</ENAMEX> tells it in his earnest prose , the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who found the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">craft</ENAMEX> 's strange debris was forced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to call the flower-inscribed scraps parts of a weather <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">balloon</ENAMEX> .
     The apparent crash became top secret , and the alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> went away upset with the rude ways of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> .
     We lost our chance to communicate with sweet-natured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> `` <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about four feet</NUMEX> tall -LCB- who -RCB- looked as though they were made of puffed-up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">marshmallow</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiflett</ENAMEX> is an editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rocky Mountain News</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trustcorp Inc.</ENAMEX> will become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Society Bank &amp; Trust</ENAMEX> when its merger is completed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Society Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Society Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , agreed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trustcorp</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.4 million</NUMEX> shares of stock with a market value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 450 million</NUMEX> .

     When the economy stumbled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo NV</ENAMEX> fell out of bed .
     Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sales , led to huge losses and left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> 's survival in doubt .
     It was n't until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> nursed itself back to health .
     Now , as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> says it is in far better shape to cope .
     Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> generally agree .
     Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.9 billion guilders</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.88 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- on acquisitions since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> to give it better balance .
     During the same period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 1.6 billion guilders</NUMEX> of assets .
     The fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 20 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> 's sales .
     `` We have definitely become less cyclical , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syb Bergsma</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>-finance , said in an interview .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal : a large presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> remain too high , making it unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> will pursue any major acquisitions in that area .
     But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akzo</ENAMEX> is considering `` alliances '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , although he would n't elaborate .
     An indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> 's success in reshaping itself will come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> when it reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to show profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 225 million guilders</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">206.3 million guilders</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     A bigger test will come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> if , as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect , bulk chemical prices slump in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     `` Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akzo</ENAMEX> can surprise the investment world a bit , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaap Visker</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV</ENAMEX> .
     He figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akzo</ENAMEX> is likely to be one of the few major chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to show profit growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> projects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> will show per-share earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24 guilders</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated 22.5 guilders</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the 20.9 guilders</NUMEX> reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Ashurst</ENAMEX> notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is less exposed than many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> to the most volatile chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">products</ENAMEX> .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has only minor petrochemical operations , is small in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> and does n't make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fertilizers</ENAMEX> .
     Thus , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> profited less than many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> from the boom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> , it has less to fear from the current slump .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is exposed to bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> , however .
     Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , they are generally stable in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said .
     A decline may come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of 1990</TIMEX> , he said , but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn .
     To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has invested heavily in specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> , which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> 's biggest move in this area was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stauffer Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> 's specialty chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 625 million</NUMEX> .
     In a less glamorous field , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is the world 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> of industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">salt</ENAMEX> , used as a raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">material</ENAMEX> for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> also makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">products</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">salt</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorine</ENAMEX> and caustic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">soda</ENAMEX> .
     In the fibers division , profit remains weak , largely because of persistent overcapacity .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is still slimming down : It recently announced plans to eliminate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,700</NUMEX> fiber-related jobs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has high hopes for some emerging fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , such carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fibers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aramid</ENAMEX> , extremely strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fibers</ENAMEX> used to reinforce tires and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> and to make such products as bullet-proof <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">vests</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Twaron</ENAMEX> aramid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fiber</ENAMEX> is a distant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Kevlar</ENAMEX> , which dominates the market .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said world-wide industry sales of aramid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fibers</ENAMEX> are expected to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Sales growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> a year seems possible , he said , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> expects its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Twaron</ENAMEX> business to become profitable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> also has spent heavily on acquisitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">paints</ENAMEX> , auto finishes and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coatings</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , for example , it completed the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110 million</NUMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance Universal Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coatings</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">wood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tyler Corp</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akzo</ENAMEX> is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> 's drug business , where profits have shown litle change for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> predicted moderate profit growth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> of birth-control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pills</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akzo</ENAMEX> hopes to have approval to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Marvelon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> also has small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> in diagnostic tests , generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and veterinary products .
     Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said .
     Among the leading products is a flu shot for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> .

     We 're sorry to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> 's departure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .

     So far as we can see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> , the counterpoint of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> .
     The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> divide into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> incompatible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> .
     There are the strict <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monetarists</ENAMEX> , who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates .
     There are the supply-side <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">globalists</ENAMEX> , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates .
     And there are the twin-deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Keynesians</ENAMEX> , who predict\/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows .
     This is a problem not only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Mulford Treasury</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> case , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> is the closest thing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> to a supply-side <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">globalist</ENAMEX> .
     He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> .
     While no doubt agreeing with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> on everything else , Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> is a dyed-in-the-wool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monetarist</ENAMEX> , inclined to defend floating rates to the death .
     To make matters even more confusing , the earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> experience made clear that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's tax cuts would have profound effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's international accounts and the value of sterling .
     They increased the after-tax rate of return and made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows .
     By accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade deficit .
     As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , M-Whatever .
     At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> surely advised , and forget the soaring pound .
     To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> has repeatedly proved disastrous .
     Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> .
     Faced with a similar situation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Volcker</ENAMEX> let the dollar soar , -LRB- though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monetarists</ENAMEX> issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation -RRB- .
     But this devastated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protectionism .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> , though not allowed to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> , chose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark .
     He reaped inflation along with rapid growth , no doubt validating Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> 's predictions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> 's mind .
     But more recently , the pound has been falling with high inflation , which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> deployed to stop it .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albion</ENAMEX> .
     We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation , and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> .
     To begin with , we should note that in contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> deficit , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> has been running largish budget surpluses .
     In pursuit of this mystery , Keynesian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adepts</ENAMEX> and twin-deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mavens</ENAMEX> need not apply .
     We should also add Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's own explanation , as we understand it .
     Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages .
     The wage stickiness , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OECD</ENAMEX> studies confirm is particularly high in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation .
     Inflation is easier to spark and harder to control .
     We should also concede that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> experience .
     Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Craig Roberts</ENAMEX> , a distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supply-sider</ENAMEX> with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates , though of course in the event Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one .
     We recall that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> not only chides the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volcker</ENAMEX> was too tight when he let the dollar rise .
     Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">globalists</ENAMEX> tend to think Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> ran onto technical reefs .
     In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial , for example , and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate .
     For that matter , perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency .
     We sympathize with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another low-tax , deregulated , supply-side economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Reynolds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polyconomics</ENAMEX> adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus .
     Those who can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation , indeed , it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reynolds</ENAMEX> also notes that since <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have no reserve requirements , high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession .
     We would add that in political terms , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's problem was failing to decide between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> .
     In the end , neither policy was followed , and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery .
     In particular , `` shadowing '' a currency is anything but fixing ; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility .
     All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy .
     Better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience .
     So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> had to resign .
     In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> 's autobiography in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The American Economist</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-circulation academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> .
     But it was the underlying situation that became intolerable .
     What Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> will do now remains to be seen .
     They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy , that is to say , stagflation .
     This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn ; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation .
     Our advice is this : Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money -LRB- which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do -RRB- .
     This was the version of supply-side economics that , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early '80s</TIMEX> , worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ENAMEX> , whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , will see its profit margins bounce back to the `` <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5 %</NUMEX> range '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman-elect</ENAMEX> .
     The ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's pretax profit margins were slightly under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> at the time of the takeover , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP</ENAMEX> 's goal is to increase margins to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-born , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">24-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> was named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX> , who is leaving by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> .
     Surrounded by stacks of paper , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> computers and photos of himself boating and flying , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> laid out several changes he hopes to make at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and foremost , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> said he hopes to improve client service .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> under the fastidious Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , of preaching what strategy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> should -- indeed , must -- follow .
     And some of its top client-service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> , were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties , with little time to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> recently freed himself up to spend more time with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> by delegating much of his administrative work to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> .
     He also plans to get to know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> was closer to , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Brothers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are planning joint visits to a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Clients</ENAMEX> want to see more of our senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved in the business -- not once a month , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times a week , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> but put on hold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover .
     The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising , public relations and design all in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place , or `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> Orchestration '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ogilvyspeak</ENAMEX> -- a reality .
     Under the reorganization , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> plans to name <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> on each account as a `` client service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> '' to work as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> 's single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> for all those services .
     `` There is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there is no single focus , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> complained to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , when the reorganization was announced .
     Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> says he hopes to have the new system in place for several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ryder</ENAMEX> -- by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are divided on whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> is up to the task .
     He is n't as well-known to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> as is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> .
     Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> there has had a dismal new-business record for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a year</TIMEX> .
     And while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> hired a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chiat\/Day\/Mojo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hamilton</ENAMEX> , to try to bolster its work , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> has to get the revenue of that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> moving , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dougherty</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">County NatWest Securities</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will be enough .
     As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dougherty</ENAMEX> says , `` The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> is obviously a long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Ogilvy Mafia</ENAMEX> , as we call it . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .
     While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> is a workaholic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detailsman</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> would rather delegate , leaving him time for his interests outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> , by contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> party <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame duck</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable , given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's profitability was dragged down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> .
     The move , budgeted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 7 million</NUMEX> , actually came in at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 million</NUMEX> , he said .
     But margins will be helped , too , by some other cost-saving steps .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> eliminated the mail room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , closed the executive dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> and , after the takeover , let go <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP</ENAMEX> , which assumes financial control of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> in a hands-on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's new headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> .
     The fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> will now be part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Y&amp;R</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> Steps Down
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Klein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Young &amp; Rubicam</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Haven</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , that he , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> and another top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> bribed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to win its account in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     In an internal memo , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kroll</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> and others and to prepare for his defense .
     `` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Y&amp;R</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX> wrote .
     He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> will return to his post at the end of the trial `` at which he will be vindicated . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> will work with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX> on some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Georgescu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Y&amp;R</ENAMEX> 's ad operations , will assume Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> role .

     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">38</TIMEX> , had headed up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heller\/Breene</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 35 million</NUMEX> in billings , will be dissolved , with some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> absorbed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina McNamee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.H.

     Comparable store sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3 %</NUMEX> .
     The net loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43.1 million</NUMEX> against a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 106 million</NUMEX> .
     The loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter of 1988</TIMEX> reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> , as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , sales were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.97 billion</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.61 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1988</TIMEX> .

     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 833.6 million</NUMEX> figures includes the new acquisitions .
     Excluding those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> would have been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 728.5 million</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> estimates its total debt at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     This includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.6 billion</NUMEX> of long-term debt , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 457.5 million</NUMEX> in short-term debt , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95.7 million</NUMEX> of the current portion of long-term debt .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkelstein</ENAMEX> is apparently referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.

     Other retail properties for sale include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> now owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T PLC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> .
     In his letter , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkelstein</ENAMEX> also referred to the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkelstein</ENAMEX> flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the earthquake , and found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 12</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> had sustained some damage , including the breakage of most windows at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">I.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Baby Ruth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Butterfinger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Pearson</ENAMEX> candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle S.A.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle Foods</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 370 million</NUMEX> .
     The sale , at a higher price than some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected , helps the food and tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> raise funds to pay debt and boosts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> candy market to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</NUMEX> .
     The candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> had sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 154 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , which was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 12 %</NUMEX> of total revenue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Planters LifeSavers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , according to a memorandum distributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> acquisition includes a candy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Franklin Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , which employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     The sale , which had been expected , is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> 's program to pay down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> bridge loan by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Roughly $ 2 billion</NUMEX> of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> expects to use <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">another $ 2 billion</NUMEX> from the pending , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part sale of most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     That sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop .
     Thus , it remains crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Gerstner Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> , called the sale a `` significant step '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's divestiture program , as well as a `` a strategic divestiture . ''
     Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 billion</NUMEX> of debt , it has agreed to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 5 billion</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have said they will dispense with certain brands , in particular , that are n't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in their markets .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Planters LifeSavers</ENAMEX> will concentrate more on our own core businesses , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Baby Ruth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Butterfinger</ENAMEX> are both among the top-selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chocolate bars</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> 's overall share of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 5.1 billion</NUMEX> market is less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> 's share of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's purchases is far below the shares of market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hershey Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mars Inc.</ENAMEX> , which have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> of the market , respectively .
     `` This means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> is now in the candybar business in a big way , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisbeth Echeandia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Orlando</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Confectioner Magazine</ENAMEX> .

     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> .

     Profit for its commercial insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 59 million</NUMEX> , reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nearly three years</TIMEX> .

     Out of the mouths of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX> are coming words of moderation .
     Here , at a soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> near the black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">township</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Soweto</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">African National Congress</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of whom had spent most of their adult lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Here were more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> , gathering for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> rally inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> since the black liberation movement was banned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> .
     Here was the state security appartus poised to pounce on any words or acts of provocation , let alone revolution .
     But the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace , unity , negotiation and discipline .
     `` We stand for peace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and we will stand for peace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Sisulu</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> 's former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary general</ENAMEX> who , along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , served <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">26 years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> before being released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> shouted `` Viva peace , viva . ''
     These are curious times in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> politics .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> , the bitterest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">enemies</ENAMEX> , are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pretoria</ENAMEX> releases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , most of whom were serving life sentences , and allows them to speak freely , hoping that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> will abandon its use of violence .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> speak in tones of moderation , emphasizing discipline , hoping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will be encouraged to take further steps , such as freeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX> , the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> , and unbanning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President F.W. de Klerk</ENAMEX> is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions .
     Meanwhile , the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organizations</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> that back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> even though the state of emergency , which has severely curtailed black opposition , remains in force .
     The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Six months ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> approval for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> rally was inconceivable .
     Equally inconceivable is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> , given the chance to hold a rally , would extend a hand , albeit warily , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     In a message read out at the rally , exiled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Tambo</ENAMEX> , who ca n't legally be quoted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> was at a crossroads and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Klerk</ENAMEX> `` may yet earn a place among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peacemakers</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> '' if he chooses a `` path of genuine political settlement . ''
     Still , this does n't mean that either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> is changing stripes -- or that either has moved significantly closer to the other .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> may ease repression in some areas , but it still keeps a tight grip in others .
     For instance , it releases Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> without conditions , yet his son , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zwelakhe</ENAMEX> , a newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> , is restricted to his home much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> and is n't allowed to work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> vows to keep up pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speakers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> called on foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> to increase sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pretoria</ENAMEX> and urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation , known as apartheid .
     `` We can not wait on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to make changes at its own pace , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> said .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> remains banned , both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , which approved the rally , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> , who orchestrated it , denied it was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> rally .
     They both called it a `` welcome home '' gathering .
     Nevertheless , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> rally by any other name is still an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> rally .
     The recently released <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands .
     Behind them was a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> flag and an even bigger sign that said `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> Lives , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> Leads . ''
     Next to them was the red flag of the outlawed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">South African Communist Party</ENAMEX> , which has long been an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">ally</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> waved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> flags , wore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> T-shirts , sang <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> songs and chanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> slogans .
     `` Today , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> , `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> has captured the center stage of political life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> . ''
     As a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopter</ENAMEX> circled overhead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> repeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> 's demands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to create a climate for negotiations : Release all political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> unconditionally ; lift all bans and restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> ; remove all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> from the black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">townships</ENAMEX> ; end the state of emergency , and cease all political trials and political executions .
     If these conditions are met , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> would be prepared to discuss suspending its guerrilla activities .
     `` There can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle , '' he said . ``
     To date , we see no clear indication that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is serious about negotiations .
     All their utterances are vague . ''
     Echoing a phrase from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Klerk</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisulu</ENAMEX> said , `` Let all of us who love this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> engage in the task of building a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX> shuttered its massive steam turbine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> , it seemed like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business .
     But now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> .
     And with its new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> , announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> has seen a significant increase in orders for power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     Most are from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> instead of regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next six years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> agree , predicting that the revived market could significantly boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's bottom line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming years</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's earnings could be materially enhanced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> or sooner , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell L. Leavitt</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> expects a need for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">140,000 megawatts</NUMEX> of new generation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next decade</TIMEX> .
     Already <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , it has received orders for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">150-megawatt</NUMEX> advanced combustion turbines from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</ENAMEX> and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">300-megawatt</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intercontinental Energy Corp.</ENAMEX> , among others .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's own role as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> also is changing .
     In the past , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> usually took token equity positions in power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> 's annnouncement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> would put up all of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</NUMEX> to build a new <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">55-megawatt</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> could herald a new age .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> will provide electrical power to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southern California Edison Co.</ENAMEX> and backup power and steam to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Borax &amp; Chemical Co</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> depending on whether we 're the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> or just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Stern</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the company 's energy and utility systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> hopes its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , from such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asea Brown Boveri AG</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens AG</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British General Electric Co</ENAMEX> .
     Under the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> also jointly will bid on projects with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Misubishi</ENAMEX> , giving it an edge in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> markets .
     In addition , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will develop new steam turbine technology , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida Power</ENAMEX> , and even utilize each other 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations .
     `` Even though we 'll still compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> , we can also work jointly on some projects , and we 'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX> contends .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> was designed as a non-equity transaction , circumventing any possible antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> carefully crafted the agreement because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asea Brown Boveri</ENAMEX> .
     It is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> which , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> expects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of its new orders for turbines to come from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least the next six years</TIMEX> .
     Despite shutdowns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lester</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">East Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> acknowledges that demand from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> could evaporate if prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> such as natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> rise sharply or if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , which have been pressured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity .
     Even if that scenario occurs , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> figures it is prepared .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Marous</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , says he expects a commercial order by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">AP600</ENAMEX> nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which is under development .
     `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2000</TIMEX> .

     Among the things I learned covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these past few weeks</TIMEX> is that the Richter scale , which measures earthquakes , is n't like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bathroom</ENAMEX> .
     A quake that measures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on the Richter is n't twice as severe as a `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> '' -- it 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times worse .
     A `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> '' is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> again , and so on .
     That put the `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> '' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 17</TIMEX> in perspective for me .
     Think I 'll buy one of those `` I Survived '' T-shirts after all .
     By Richterian standards , the show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland Athletics</ENAMEX> put on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> , in putting a mercifully swift end to the game 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Longest Short Series</ENAMEX> , rated somewhere <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between a 10 and an 11</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> with the white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much , but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pale Pachyderms</ENAMEX> propelled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> games en route to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wins over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> .
     Combined with their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pre-quake victories , way back on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 14</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">15</TIMEX> -LRB- the scores were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , remember ? -RRB- , that gave them a sweep of the best-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> series .
     The joke here is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> lost by de fault .
     That 's geologically correct , but a trifle unfair otherwise .
     They showed up , but did n't -- or could n't -- challenge .
     They led for nary an inning in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> games , and managed to stir their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> only once .
     That came in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> inning of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Game Four</ENAMEX> when , trailing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , they scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times and brought their big heat -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Clark</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Mitchell</ENAMEX> -- to the plate with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out and a runner on .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> flied out to short right field and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's drive to left was caught on the warning track by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rickey Henderson</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,000</NUMEX> sets of lungs exhaled as one .
     `` I went out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd -LCB- Burns</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reliever</ENAMEX> -RCB- and told him that we were n't gon na let this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> beat us , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Steinbach</ENAMEX> of the decisive confrontation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National League</ENAMEX> 's reigning home-run <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> .
     `` I told him to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> reach for everything , and that 's what we did .
     The ball he hit was n't a strike .
     If it had been , he mighta hit it out . ''
     But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> had n't won in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> , they would have prevailed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> .
     The best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> won this <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> , which is more unusual than it may sound .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX> ai n't <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> , where the good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> beat up on the bad ones .
     The best baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> games and the worst win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> .
     Without becoming overly contentious , allow me to suggest that several recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">champions</ENAMEX> of the world according to us -LRB- as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> -RRB- might not have ranked No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in many polls .
     That list includes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last season</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">champs</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Los Angeles Dodgers</ENAMEX> , who rode a miracle home run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Gibson</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> faultless pitching performances by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orel Hershiser</ENAMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-game triumph over a bewitched , bothered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> , however , got few grades as low as B on their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> report card .
     They led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Major Leagues</ENAMEX> in regular-season wins with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> and flattened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Toronto Blue Jays</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> games to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American League</ENAMEX> pennant before stomping their cross-bay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">rivals</ENAMEX> .
     The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Craig</ENAMEX> after his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> had fallen in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Game Three</ENAMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-home-run barrage that tied a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">61-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> record .
     Asked what he would do differently on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">morrow</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> allowed that he might play his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outfielders</ENAMEX> deeper , `` maybe on the other side of the fence . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> offensive showing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> got an A , as in awesome .
     Their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> total bases broke a record for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-game set , and their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> home runs tied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> hit homers , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centerfielder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Henderson</ENAMEX> getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , both on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rickey Henderson</ENAMEX> , the do-everything leadoff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> hits and set or tied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-game <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> marks for triples -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -RRB- and stolen bases -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     The sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">A</ENAMEX> not to homer was cleanup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McGwire</ENAMEX> , their regular-season <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> , and he contributed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Game Three</ENAMEX> that stopped a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant</ENAMEX> rally while the issue still was in doubt .
     `` Think I 'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove , '' quipped the big first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baseman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , fingering the gold bat he wears on a neck chain .
     Even with that power show , though , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Oakland Series</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> , certified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Most Valuable Player</ENAMEX> award , was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Stewart</ENAMEX> .
     He shut out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hits in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Game One</ENAMEX> , and allowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> runs on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hits in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> innings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 12-day</TIMEX> break caused by the earthquake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> 's honor was a nice note on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> of grounds .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> was that , despite his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> regular-season wins over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past three seasons</TIMEX> in the Land Beyond the Late News , he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> and missed out on prizes that might have been his due .
     The other is that he 's an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> , and lifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     Afterward , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> toasted their victory with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> -LRB- they dispensed with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">champagne</ENAMEX> showers in deference to the quake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy .
     `` Give me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> , and I do n't care if I ever win a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Cy Young</ENAMEX> , '' he said , in reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> 's best-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> award .
     Indeed , the possibility of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> ring cycle , a\/k\/a a dynasty , was a major topic of post-game discussion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> , so much so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Alderson</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , felt obliged to dampen it .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> change , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> change , '' he cautioned .
     `` It 's easier to get worse than better in this game . ''
     He might have added an interesting historical fact : The last <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> sweep , by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cincinnati Reds</ENAMEX> , came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , which also was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> player free agency .
     It was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous , `` big market '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to monopolize the best talent , but quite the opposite has occurred : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clubs</ENAMEX> have won titles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 14 seasons</TIMEX> since its advent .
     The number includes such unstylish burgs as , well , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> .

     The rationale for responding to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ' needs faster than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">competition</ENAMEX> can is clear : Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will benefit in terms of market share , customer satisfaction and profitability .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before .
     However , for many , managing speed does not come naturally .
     `` Most of us grew up believing in the axioms ` Haste makes waste ' and ` Do n't cut corners , ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Cassell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for product integrity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman Corp</ENAMEX> .
     `` But in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off .
     Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> that actually market speed as part of their service train their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to lead and participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that increase speed and improve quality in everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> learn to spot opportunities to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction through speed , and shift some responsibility for analyzing , improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express Ground Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Natick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation : the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> package sort .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every morning</TIMEX> , tractor-trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> arrive at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Natick Ground Station</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> , carrying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's package load .
     In peak periods that load may include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> pieces .
     The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> for delivery , so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couriers</ENAMEX> can be on the road by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> .
     No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> is present at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> package sort , but the process is nevertheless critical to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction .
     `` We 're committed to deliver the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> 's package by a stated time , usually <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30</TIMEX> , '' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Mortimer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Natick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> .
     `` The sooner our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> hit the road <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> , the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation . ''
     Following a problem-solving formula used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Natick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> monitored their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> routine , carefully noting where and when the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 's resources were used effectively and where they were idle , waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way .
     `` We suspected there was downtime built into our process .
     But we did n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer</ENAMEX> says .
     `` We used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> even created a points system to identify those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couriers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> that were doing the most to reduce package-sort cycle time .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tonawanda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> already on the line .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> then proposed modifications in their work process to management .
     `` The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> ways , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westendorf</ENAMEX> concludes .

     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman 's Aircraft Systems Division</ENAMEX> , a cross-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract .

     `` We needed contributions from all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">departments</ENAMEX> to generate the proposal , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Anton</ENAMEX> , configuration-data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">A-6</ENAMEX> combat aircraft program .
     `` But instead of gathering their input piecemeal , we formed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved . ''
     Armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information , each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> developed its specialized contribution to the proposal , submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule .
     `` We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anton</ENAMEX> explains .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> trimmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two months</TIMEX> from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate .

     Home taping of pre-recorded music cuts into record industry revenues , but banning home taping would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> even more .
     That 's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Office of Technology Assessment</ENAMEX> at the request of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> judiciary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> .
     The report is to be released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The report says the availability of such advanced analog recording equipment as cassette recorders does n't seem to increase the quantity of home copying .
     That finding , the report says , casts doubt on the record industry 's contention that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of copyrighted material by home tapers .
     The longstanding position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Recording Industry Association of America</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , is that record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">songwriters</ENAMEX> and music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers</ENAMEX> need to be remunerated by government-imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping .
     `` I think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Shapiro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for government and legal affairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Electronic Industries Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     `` What -LCB- the report -RCB- shows is everything we 've been saying for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past eight or nine years</TIMEX> -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who tape the most buy the most . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trish Heimers</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">RIAA</ENAMEX> says her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment .
     A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> requires that any digital audio tape , or DAT , recorder sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> have a built-in device that restricts its ability to make <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> copies from DAT tape copies of digital compact disks .
     But the disappointing sales of DAT machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the three years</TIMEX> of legal wrangling that went into the agreement .
     Under current copyright laws , it is considered `` fair use '' to reproduce copyrighted material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> , while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited .
     A survey contained in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">291</NUMEX>-page report , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Copyright and Home Copying : Technology Challenges the Law</ENAMEX> , '' found that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> consider home copying for such personal use a `` right '' -- a right , moreover , that was exercised by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the age of 10</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> .
     The study says that the `` ambiguous legal status '' of home copying makes it `` appropriate to examine the effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> , as well as on industry . ''
     Reports by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Office of Technology Assessment</ENAMEX> do n't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> may pursue .
     The study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes `` an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology , '' and says that finding an `` appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision , not a technical one .

     He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     His latest coup : <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's masterminding of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five billion Swiss-franc</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.07 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- merger between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adia S.A.</ENAMEX> , the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest temporary employment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inspectorate International S.A.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX>-controlled product-inspection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .

     But such tactics were alien to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , and still are n't common because of share restrictions that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are allowed to maintain .
     Eventually , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> was forced to sell his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> shares to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG</ENAMEX> as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 million Swiss francs</NUMEX> on the sale .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> was not an unfriendly takeover , '' he insists .
     Buying from willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> makes an unfriendly takeover impossible , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> contends .
     `` I bought from willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> . ''
     Nevertheless , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome .
     And he has worked to shed his raider image .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , his career as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialist</ENAMEX> began with the acquisition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> metals works <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Selve</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Thun</ENAMEX> .
     With the nonferrous metals business undermined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland</ENAMEX> by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs , this looked like a dull undertaking .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> brought about a merger in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> ; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three years later</TIMEX> , machinery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A.</ENAMEX> was to become part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> .
     Once again the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's future looked less than rosy .
     But after restructuring under new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> , the profits began rolling in .
     A major boost to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> 's respectability among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> when he sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phibro Bank</ENAMEX> to the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> cantonal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     They renamed it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Swiss Cantobank</ENAMEX> and are using it to expand abroad .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> bested leading publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jean Frey AG</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     And with the recent acquisition of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Winterthur</ENAMEX>-based machinery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gebrueder Sulzer AG</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> has enjoyed the status of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knight</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sulzer</ENAMEX> preferred him to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tito Tettamanti</ENAMEX> , whose secretive raid on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock had led to a bitter battle .
     Meanwhile , as such strategic investments have mounted , the merchant-banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omni Holding</ENAMEX> has been busily buying and selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , often after a financial or corporate restructuring .
     Today , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> runs under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omnicorp Offering Services</ENAMEX> and handles mergers and acquisitions , placement of securities and real estate .
     In its portfolio are such diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air Europe</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Checkrobot Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that makes supermarket checkout machines ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norment Industries</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of securities systems ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Com Systems</ENAMEX> Inc. , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> regional telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> ; and major real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">projects</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     For financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omni</ENAMEX> 's accounts is a tough challenge .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> move in and out , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helga Kern</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KK Swiss Investment</ENAMEX> .
     Financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> note that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> is attracted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omni</ENAMEX> unexpectedly bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inspectorate</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harpener AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , a land-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The internal transaction within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> puzzled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harpener</ENAMEX> 's small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say it makes sense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inspectorate-Adia</ENAMEX> to focus on its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> of product inspection and temporary help .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> says the move is yet another example of his conservatism .
     He explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with real estate give `` security . ''
     The real estate can be used , he points out , as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development .
     He says he wants to `` influence '' but not `` manage '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't want to be like -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan -RCB- Bond</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX> .
     I do n't want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to be built around me as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> .
     I want them to stand alone .

     In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step of a reorganization that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> said it will create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Defense and Space Group</ENAMEX> to consolidate several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> met separately last night with a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in an attempt to break the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">month-old</TIMEX> strike that has shut the aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> 's assembly lines at a time when it has an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 billion</NUMEX> backlog of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jetliner</ENAMEX> orders .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> already have rejected a package that would provide a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> pay raise plus bonuses over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> life of the contract .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has said repeatedly it wo n't expand its offer and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> have responded that the offer is n't good enough .
     However , the resolve of some of the striking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> might be weakening .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strikers</ENAMEX> signed petitions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to schedule new meetings .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sides</ENAMEX> had n't met since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 18</TIMEX> .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's commercial business is booming , its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> presidency .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> consolidated its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aerospace and Electronics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> ; the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Defense and Space Group</ENAMEX> will contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aerospace and Electronics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advanced Systems</ENAMEX> , both based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> area ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Helicopters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Military Airplanes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wichita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ArgoSystems</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif</ENAMEX> .

     A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-day</TIMEX> meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-nation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , did n't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls .
     Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who attended the talks .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> had been under pressure from several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> , to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools , which those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> argued were now widely available to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> from non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> have complained that outdated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> also have been pressing for special treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> as they move toward more democratic rule , just as special treatment had been agreed on for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> at the meeting decided that this was `` a matter for further discussion at future meetings . ''
     They added that `` all of us -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> -RRB- look at the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> in a positive way , but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also said the meeting agreed to continue treating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> as a special case , despite the recent repression of dissent there , but to offer no further concessions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said that despite the rapid changes under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> agreed on `` the continuing need for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> , '' which was founded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">40 years ago</TIMEX> at the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Cold War</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the meeting agreed to continue working toward `` streamlining '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> 's restricted products list , and to improve procedures for punishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that do n't comply with the export restrictions .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX> 's announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 648.2 million</NUMEX> loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     At the same time , the sheer size of the loss , coupled with a slowing of orders , made some securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> and defense-electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> is getting clobbered .
     Just clobbered , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ulric Weil</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weil &amp; Associates</ENAMEX> who had once been high on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The quarter</TIMEX> was terrible , and the future looks anything but encouraging . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> , whose revenue inched up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.35 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.27 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier quarter</TIMEX> , had an operating loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 30 million</NUMEX> .
     On top of that , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Blue Bell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> took a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 230 million</NUMEX> charge related to the layoffs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     That is at the high end of the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,000 to 8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a month ago</TIMEX> would be laid off .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> said that should help it save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> a year in costs , again at the high end of the previously reported range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million to $ 500 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also took a write-off of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts , as some new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 million to $ 70 million</NUMEX> -- to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> also noted that it paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 78.8 million</NUMEX> in taxes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , even though tax payments normally would be minimal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a quarter</TIMEX> that produced such a big loss .
     The tax payments will leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225 million</NUMEX> in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarters</TIMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> said it reduced computer inventories a further <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , leaving it within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> of its goal of a reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> business was weak during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , a worrisome sign given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past several quarters</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also reported slower growth in another important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> : systems that use the Unix operating system .
     That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> is betting its business on the assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> want to move away from using operating systems that run on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load .
     Debt has risen to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 4 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> of total capitalization .
     That means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> must pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100 million</NUMEX> in interest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every quarter</TIMEX> , on top of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27 million</NUMEX> in dividends on preferred stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Unruh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , said he is approaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> with caution .
     He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards .
     He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     He said the move toward standard operating systems means <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> and can force prices down .
     That , he said , is why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> is overhauling its whole business : It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have been used to .
     `` We 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unruh</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business , and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term . ''
     Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Some had predicted earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 4</NUMEX> a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's fully diluted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.27</NUMEX> a share on earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 680.6 million</NUMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that it had losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 673.3 million</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> , compared with earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 382.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.22</NUMEX> a share fully diluted , as revenue inched up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.13 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.03 billion</NUMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> is expected to do little better than break even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Milunovich</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> said he is cutting his earnings estimate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> .
     `` I was feeling like I was too high to begin with , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weil</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weil &amp; Associates</ENAMEX> said he will remain at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk .
     `` The break-even point for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> is much lower , but is it low enough ? '' he asked .
     Reflecting the concern , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> stock fell a further <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.25</NUMEX> in composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .

     If a TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weatherman</ENAMEX> gets <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> facing the camera again after a questionable forecast , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald H. Straszheim</ENAMEX> surely understands .
     The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> expects he will take some heat , and he 's right .
     Since the last time he traveled this way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months ago</TIMEX> , he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1988</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> commentary announced that `` the economy is likely to fall into recession in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1989</TIMEX> . ''
     The forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad campaign launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer of 1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to buy bonds .
     It said long-term interest rates , then <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 9 %</NUMEX> , could drop to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1989</TIMEX> , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would be a good buy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> and later to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> .
     But this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> -- just when many market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> , including some at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , believed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn .
     He softened the talk about a recession .
     Now , in fact , he is predicting economic growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some four dozen</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters</ENAMEX> surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blue Chip Economic Indicators</ENAMEX> newsletter .
     And , just recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> cut the recommended bondholdings back to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     While such changes might sound minor , they are n't : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> manages or oversees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 300 billion</NUMEX> in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> was right the first time are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bostian Jr.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Gary Shilling</ENAMEX> , both of whom run their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bostian</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> that his macroeconomic index signaled recession .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shilling</ENAMEX> , who was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> , has heralded a recession for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> .
     `` My own personal opinion is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX> threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet , '' he says .
     Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy .
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that `` it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time . ''
     He adds , `` That 's the forecasting business . ''
     However risky the business , it 's brisk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     Pestered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> and media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and pushed by their own egos , Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> indicator .
     But the surprisingly durable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-year</TIMEX> economic expansion has made mincemeat of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> forecast .
     This is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> .
     This is the commercial version .
     Carrying the new message on the road , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> .
     No sophisticated professional expects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> to be right all the time .
     Some smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> do n't seem to notice his switch .
     But with some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , the talk can heat up a bit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis O'Brien</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commonwealth Edison Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , adopts a polite approach , waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A good half-hour</TIMEX> into breakfast at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Palmer House</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> looks up from his plate after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> says something about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who believe interest rates are about to nosedive .
     `` I 'm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them who hope they will , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> in debt on the books .
     Is that the forecast ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> asks , trying to pin down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> .
     He does n't fully succeed , although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> lists an array of interest-rate scenarios .
     In a chilly conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alliance Capital Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , in contrast , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> seem ready to pin Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> to the wall .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Harrison</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , shoves Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> 's handout back at him : `` Do we want to go through this ?
     Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it 's about to be right ? ''
     Swiveling in his chair , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> replies that the new outlook , though still weak , does n't justify calling a recession right now . ``
     It 's all in this handout you do n't want to look at .
     We could still have a recession '' at some point .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> 's recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white .
     Sometimes , like now , it 's gray .
     This somewhat-ambiguous assessment moves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alliance</ENAMEX> portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> to ask : `` So , what is this -- a Stealth recession ? ''
     Another challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> 's bond recommendation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     `` We 're not running that ad campaign any more , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> snaps in a rare show of irritation .
     He adds , `` I think it was a fairly decent call . ''
     Explaining his change of mind , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> says later , `` It 's hard to pin this on one factor . ''
     He says the economy , and especially the employment numbers , look much better than he expected ; interest rates have generally declined ; inflation has n't run amok .
     `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> is constantly looking at all these things , '' he says .
     His new forecast calls for `` a soft landing . ''
     And it may be right , judging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's report that inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shilling</ENAMEX> understands Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> 's problems .
     `` There 's unbelievable pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> to forecast these numbers , '' he says . ``
     You make a forecast , and then you become its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> . ''
     It is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Straszheim</ENAMEX> is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip .
     His approach to the recantation is direct but low-key .
     `` For some time , we had forecast negative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third - and fourth-quarter</TIMEX> growth .
     We pulled that forecast , '' he begins matter-of-factly in a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper , Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">stop</ENAMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> displayed unusual political immaturity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> , resigned because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> would not fire her trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> .
     The opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Kinnock</ENAMEX> , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> , denounced Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Cabinet</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> , making a mountain out of a molehill , precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autocrat</ENAMEX> who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> from her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> want the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound formally tied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> mark .
     Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> considers this an ill-advised and costly policy .
     As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining .
     Until his resignation , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> had been conducting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark .
     When Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> cut the top tax rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> flooded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark .
     As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> , through a long and costly effort , had subdued .
     With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark .
     To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> .
     This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Labor</ENAMEX> ahead in the polls .
     Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> economic policy and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's political fortune , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> , which subordinates all member currencies to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> monetary policy .
     This put Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> in a bind .
     The concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .
     If the pound had been tied to the mark , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates .
     The reason is simple .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and drives up the value of its currency .
     It was fear of disturbing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EMS</ENAMEX> exchange-rate relationships that caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> to be timid about cutting tax rates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edouard Balladur</ENAMEX> , the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would be criticized as anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> for disturbing the linked <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> currency relationship .
     The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> -- is a trade deficit .
     To avoid this deficit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise .
     This misguided policy could not prevent a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> trade deficit .
     Consequently , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> saddled Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> political failures in a row .
     Little wonder that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> were so anxious to keep Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> in office .
     It is extraordinary that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">British Treasury</ENAMEX> thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> , the flow abroad of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> capital slowed , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 billion pounds</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 79 billion</NUMEX> at the current rate -RRB- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">93 billion pounds</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     This change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     The most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates .
     This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction .
     Then , when the currency falls , interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate .
     This policy is totally mindless , and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> is correct to point out its deficiencies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> and all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> need to reconsider the prospects for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> .
     A unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> that remained within the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">alliance</ENAMEX> would give <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> such an overshadowing position that all other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> of a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> would become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">vassals</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> .
     Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> collapses , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> reunification is likely to require <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> 's neutralization .
     The implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> need considering before we judge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation to be unfortunate .
     In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows .

     Personal spending , which fueled the economy 's growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , was clearly slowing by the end of the period , raising questions about the economy 's strength as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> ends .
     Personal spending grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.526 trillion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said .
     It was the smallest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     At the same time , personal income was held down by the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , which tore through parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North and South Carolina</ENAMEX> in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> said personal income rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.469 trillion</NUMEX> rate but would have climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6 %</NUMEX> had it not been for the storm .
     Among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income .
     The figures came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> released a report showing that consumer spending propelled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic expansion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> while -- on an inflation-adjusted basis -- business investment slowed , government spending declined , and exports were flat .
     But the new statistics show that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , the burst in spending seemed to be tapering off .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> expect the weakness to continue .
     `` I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> has pretty well played himself out , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Littman</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't think there 's a lot in the wings '' in other sectors of the economy to keep growth above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> , he said .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , the economy grew at a moderate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , personal income rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> and spending grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> have attributed much of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> 's spurt in spending to bargain car prices at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the model year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Car</ENAMEX> sales slackened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> were introduced .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> report , spending on durable goods -- items expected to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least three years</TIMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> -- declined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's savings rate was unchanged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.9 %</NUMEX> of after-tax income , far below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 %</NUMEX> it reached in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations .
     Here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> 's latest report on personal income .
     The figures are at seasonally adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rates in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillions of dollars</NUMEX> .
