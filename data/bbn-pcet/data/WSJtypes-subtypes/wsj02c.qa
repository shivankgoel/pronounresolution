     Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> agreed on a compromise minimum-wage bill , opening the way for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> wage-floor boost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than nine years</TIMEX> .
     The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> over the wage issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> vetoed a measure passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and said he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's debate on the issue .
     The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> had said it would accept .
     Under the agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , the minimum wage would rise from the current <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.35</NUMEX> an hour to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1991</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Employers</ENAMEX> could also pay a subminimum `` training wage '' for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 days</TIMEX> to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">up to 19 years old</TIMEX> , and then for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another 90 days</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> institutes a specific training program for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage , which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has fought for throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     `` For the first time in history , we have a training wage that will be part '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's labor laws , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Porter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for economic and domestic policy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage , the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     The bill vetoed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> failed to override , would have lifted the minimum wage to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.55</NUMEX> an hour by late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , with a training wage for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">up to two months</TIMEX> , generally for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> job .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour by the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , coupled with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> training wage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> newly hired by any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> .
     Under the compromise , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> level would be reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nine months earlier</TIMEX> , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> argued that the training wage was a way of allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> to pay less than the minimum wage , while new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">far less than six months</TIMEX> to be trained for their jobs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> had been negotiating with some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> on a compromise lately .
     With congressional elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> have been imploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> to compromise on the wage issue .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Committee</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici</ENAMEX> , -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M</ENAMEX> . -RRB- ranking minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Budget Committee</ENAMEX> , have been working on a compromise , and their soundings showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> veto , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> is scheduled to vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> on the compromise , as a substitute to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> bill , itself watered down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> 's version .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> will probably vote not long afterward .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> thought they might have compromised too much .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin Murphy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman of the</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> labor standards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> , said they might have done better `` if we 'd held their feet to the fire . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> `` yielded a great deal '' on the size of the increase , but he cited concessions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> on the training wage , which he said make it `` less harsh . ''
     With only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">16-year-olds to 19-year-olds</TIMEX> eligible , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> getting less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour , who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> , wo n't be subject to the training wage , he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> , which previously opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's subminimum idea , said the compromise has `` adequate safeguards , so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> are not exploited and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are not displaced .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it lowered the ratings on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3.2 billion</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co.</ENAMEX> 's securities because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Houston Lighting</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Houston Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> , a utility holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Houston Lighting</ENAMEX> 's current situation has some positive aspects , including managing `` very well '' the construction and commercial operation risks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Units 1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">2</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South Texas</ENAMEX> Project nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong World Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed in principle to sell its carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shaw Industries Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The price was n't disclosed but one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> estimated that it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> , which has faced a takeover threat from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belzberg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , said that disposing of the carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> would improve `` total financial performance . ''
     The move also would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to concentrate on core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , which include ceramic tile , floor coverings and furniture .
     Moreover , such a sale could help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> reassure its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and deter the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belzbergs</ENAMEX> , who own a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.85 %</NUMEX> stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lancaster</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition .
     The carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 368.3 million</NUMEX> , or almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.68 billion</NUMEX> total revenue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has been manufacturing carpet since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> .
     Recently it upgraded its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> so that it could make stain-resistant products with higher quality dyes .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year or two</TIMEX> , the carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> 's operating profit margins have hovered around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 % to 19 %</NUMEX> margins for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , flooring and building products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> , the market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> carpet industry , with an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 % to 20 %</NUMEX> share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dalton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga.</ENAMEX> , has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.18 billion</NUMEX> , and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> 's brands , sold under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Evans-Black</ENAMEX> names .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy is slowing .
     The small increase in the index of leading indicators , which had climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> but was unchanged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably .
     However , it does n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon .
     `` I do n't think it provides much new information on the economy , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rippe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .</ENAMEX>
     So far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the index of leading indicators has risen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four months</TIMEX> , fallen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four months</TIMEX> and remained unchanged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the other month</TIMEX> .
     In another report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said sales of new single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">618,000</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">719,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     The declines were particularly pronounced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> was a factor .
     Although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's weakness followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two strong months</TIMEX> for home sales , the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> drop was the largest since a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1982</TIMEX> , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators .
     Because the figures are based on a small sample , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said it is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> confident only that new-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> sales fell somewhere <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 5 % and 23 %</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> also said it takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four months</TIMEX> to establish a trend .
     So far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">534,000</NUMEX> newly built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> have been sold , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the like months of 1988</TIMEX> .
     The index of leading indicators got a major boost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Michigan</ENAMEX> .
     This measure had dropped sharply in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index , the influence of this component has been reduced .
     Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> components to the index , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> others rose in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> : the money supply , the length of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the average work week</TIMEX> and stock prices .
     Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new plant and equipment , and backlogs of orders for durable goods .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Manufacturers</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> a recent poll of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61 %</NUMEX> do n't expect a recession to occur until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> or later .
     The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> often are quick to call for lower interest rates , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said they would prefer that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The other 40 %</NUMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down .
     All the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns .
     Here are the net contributions of the components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> 's index of leading indicators .
     After various adjustments , they produced a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> rise in the index for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> rise for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , and the change from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , are : from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.11</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous month</TIMEX> .

     An imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> writing a thriller about amateur spy-chasing might invent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Stoll</ENAMEX> , but it 's unlikely .
     It 's also unnecessary .
     Amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy-chaser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Stoll</ENAMEX> is a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> , or as he might waggishly put it , a surreal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> .
     He is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">37</TIMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronomer</ENAMEX> with impressive credentials , and something of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> at making computers do his bidding .
     He once described himself as a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hippie</ENAMEX> , '' and played the role well ; obligatory ragged jeans , a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional , including , for a time at least , formal marriage to his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweetheart</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Matthews</ENAMEX> .
     He also is an entertaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> , combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work .
     In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Cuckoo 's Egg</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.95</NUMEX> -RRB- , he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">18 months</TIMEX> to catch a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> .
     The result <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> was the arrest by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West Germans</ENAMEX> , accused of stealing information from computers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and selling it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">KGB</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">25-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markus Hess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hannover</ENAMEX> , allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> high-security computers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , searching for secrets .
     He probably did n't penetrate any top-secret files , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">KGB</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">East Berlin</ENAMEX> was willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of his associates , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Carl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirk Brezinski</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> for some of the material <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hess</ENAMEX> collected .
     They promised yet more for really good stuff .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> draws his title from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoo</ENAMEX> 's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> , making them surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parents</ENAMEX> .
     The computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> had discovered that a popular editing\/electronic mail program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gnu-Emacs</ENAMEX> could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> .
     Using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODCUT:OTHER">Gnu-Emacs</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> could substitute a bogus `` atrun '' program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> .
     Once his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoo</ENAMEX> 's egg was laid , he could enter Unix and become a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-user</ENAMEX> , '' with access to everything .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> was scanning the heavens at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">observatory</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lab</ENAMEX> 's computers .
     He discovered a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75-cent</NUMEX> discrepancy in the charges made to various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">departments</ENAMEX> for computer time and traced it to a user named `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> , '' who had no valid billing address .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> suspected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intruder</ENAMEX> was one of those precocious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who has fun breaking into computers .
     But after much tracking , it became evident to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> , through various clues , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> was not on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Berkeley</ENAMEX> campus or even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     Finding him became an obsession for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> .
     He made a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lab</ENAMEX> 's computers .
     After discovering that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Sventek</ENAMEX> , he rigged up an alarm system , including a portable beeper , to alert him when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sventek</ENAMEX> came on the line .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Some nights</TIMEX> he slept under his desk .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> complained about neglect of other chores .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> was pawing over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Berkeley</ENAMEX> files but also using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Berkeley</ENAMEX> and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">White Sands</ENAMEX> missile range and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitre Inc.</ENAMEX> were among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">targets</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> moved , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> moved too , calling up other systems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion .
     Sometimes , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> seemed to be into a sensitive file , he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarry</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> initially showed little interest , and he had the impression other federal security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> were tangled up in legal red tape .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> told him it does not do domestic counterespionage .
     One learns a lot from this book , or seems to , about crippling federal bureaucracy .
     `` Seems to '' because it 's possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Agency</ENAMEX> were more interested than they let on to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> .
     Finally , he got help .
     Tymnet is a major network linking computers .
     One of its international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve White</ENAMEX> , took a quick interest in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> 's hunt , ultimately tracing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West Germans</ENAMEX> then took over and finally found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markus Hess</ENAMEX> .
     Eventually , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> was invited to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSA</ENAMEX> to brief high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> on computer theft .
     He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaps</ENAMEX> .
     Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> , he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> for consorting with such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     He became angry in return .
     He had developed a hatred for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> and a grudging appreciation of the federal `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spooks</ENAMEX> '' who make national security their business .
     At several different levels , it 's a fascinating tale .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips Computer Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also will announce an agreement to supply computers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> , which will sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> machines under its own label .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> machine , called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">RC6280</ENAMEX> , will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150,000</NUMEX> for a basic system .
     The computer processes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 million</NUMEX> instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors .
     The machine employs reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , technology .
     At that price , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> familiar with the machine said , the computer offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10</NUMEX> times the performance of similar machines .
     `` In the price range it 's a tremendously high-performing product , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Gant</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at the market-research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">InfoCorp .</ENAMEX>
     The machine is part of an effort by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> to establish itself as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> of computers , not just of integrated-circuit technology .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> said the new machine will also be used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> and for communications .
     `` This clearly demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> is a systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> rather than just a chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hime</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> deal is a boon for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> because it gives the the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">five-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ally</ENAMEX> as it battles more established electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> for the emerging market for RISC machines .
     RISC technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> , which expects revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , big-name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">allies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> are essential to attract software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's RISC architecture .
     `` The thing it says about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> is that they 're on a roll right now , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gant</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">InfoCorp .</ENAMEX>
     `` They 're getting some major wins , '' she added .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> agreed to supply its computers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nixdorf Computer AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Groupe Bull</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem Computers Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment</ENAMEX> have agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> computers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens A.G.</ENAMEX> have agreed to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> chips under license .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's agreement gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> a machine to compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and other general-purpose computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Logan</ENAMEX> , a computer-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aberdeen Group Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> .
     The machine is essentially a mainframe computer , he said .
     `` Suddenly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CDC</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> -RRB- has a competitive product to fight back against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX9000</ENAMEX> , '' a machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , he added .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minn.</ENAMEX> , expects its sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> systems , including the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">RC6280</ENAMEX> , to amount to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 million</NUMEX> by the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nixdorf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bull</ENAMEX> and others will also sell versions of the machine , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Miller</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> will start shipping its new machine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter of 1990</TIMEX> , he said .
     The machine uses a single processor , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors .
     The computer can process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.3 million</NUMEX> calculations called floating-point operations every second .
     The machine can run software written for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mips</ENAMEX> computers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .

     Another fight is brewing between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit .
     In a hearing before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> , which both are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">arms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , advised the new S&amp;L bailout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout .
     Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">GAO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> should consider using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> budget law .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> has projected that it will require <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion</NUMEX> in temporary working capital .
     The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> are sold .
     The new S&amp;L law allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> to issue notes for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 85 %</NUMEX> of the value of the assets it holds .
     But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> argued .
     `` To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortney Stark</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who has introduced a bill to limit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> 's authority to issue debt .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> will have to sell or merge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of insolvent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thrifts</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three years</TIMEX> .
     The new S&amp;L bailout law allows <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion</NUMEX> to be spent to sell or merge sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;Ls</ENAMEX> and their assets , but that is a net cost .
     In the meantime , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold .
     Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mullins</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loans</ENAMEX> without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions .
     He said it has n't yet been determined how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> will raise the cash , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> or big increases in the budget deficit .
     But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said .
     `` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> may have to slow -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> sales -RCB- or dump acquired assets through fire sales .

     The tattered black binder , bulging with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18 years</TIMEX> ' worth of recipes held together by rubber bands , was in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey Shere</ENAMEX> 's purse when it was stolen from her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> recently .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sweets</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , they figure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">culprit</ENAMEX> probably took money from Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> 's wallet and discarded all the tips in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">five-by-eight-inch</NUMEX> looseleaf .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Waters</ENAMEX> , is considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of the cooking style known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> cuisine and whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> make reservations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> in advance , has n't exactly subjected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> to vanilla <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">ice cream</ENAMEX> because of the theft .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> can draw on her cookbook , published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four years ago</TIMEX> , which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sherbet</ENAMEX> , gooseberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fool</ENAMEX> -LRB- a creamy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">dish</ENAMEX> made with crushed stewed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">berries</ENAMEX> -RRB- and hazelnut `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oeufs a la neige</ENAMEX> . ''
     For another , sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> have sent Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> .
     Still , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> 's ever-changing menu of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-course dinners -- it supposedly has n't repeated a meal since opening in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> -- requires constant improvisation .
     And that puts added pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> dessert-menu <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> .
     `` We make what we know how to make , '' says business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mazzera</ENAMEX> .
     Many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> 's pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> express disbelief that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> kept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Baker 's Dozen</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs</ENAMEX> that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meringues</ENAMEX> from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shere</ENAMEX> has offered a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch .
     `` It 's an overwhelming job , '' she says .
     `` There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">butter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare International Inc.</ENAMEX> said it reached a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">120-day</TIMEX> standstill agreement with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> right away and additional amounts in the future .
     Under the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manager</ENAMEX> of health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> , said it would pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.9 million</NUMEX> in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 million</NUMEX> in funds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> advanced for construction work on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     In return , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">120-day</TIMEX> period .
     After the payment , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> still will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 million</NUMEX> in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> , a real estate investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> has given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> note for that overdue amount , to be repaid over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> agreed to make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> rent and mortgage payments of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 million to $ 3 million</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> during the standstill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">period</TIMEX> , to be paid when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> successfully completes asset sales .
     Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> actually owes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 million</NUMEX> in rent and mortgage payments each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> note .
     The funds should help ease a cash bind at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HealthVest</ENAMEX> , which has been unable to pay its debts because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> , which has been in a severe liquidity bind , said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc.</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Greenery</ENAMEX> purchased stock and warrants for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> and loaned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Healthcare</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 million</NUMEX> .

     The crowning moment in the career of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph F. O'Kicki</ENAMEX> came as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> local and state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dignitaries</ENAMEX> packed into his elegant , marble-columned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtroom</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> for his swearing in as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President Judge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
     Baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench .
     The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Legion</ENAMEX> color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">guard</ENAMEX> led the way .
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe , he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare .
     To many , it was a ceremony more befitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> than a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> seated in the isolated foothills of the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Allegheny Mountains</ENAMEX> .
     But then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> often behaved like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> -- and , some say , an arrogant and abusive one .
     While his case may be extreme , it reflects the vulnerability of many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> to domineering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last March</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nine months</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's swearing-in , the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than 10 years</TIMEX> of `` official oppression '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> , a depressed steel and mining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">community</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> .
     The allegations , ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness , paint a disquieting picture .
     According to testimony in a public , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-page grand-jury report handed up to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> extorted cash from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , muscled favorable loans from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and bullied local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a decade</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> , in an indictment based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">grand jury</ENAMEX> 's report , maintain that at various times since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributorship</ENAMEX> ; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set up a dummy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and obtain insurance for his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> -LRB- now his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; and maintained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> accounts in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
     In testimony recorded in the grand jury report , court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">59 years old</TIMEX> , harassed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> , made imperial demands on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and hounded anyone who crossed him .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bailiffs</ENAMEX> claimed they were required to chauffeur him to and from work , mow his lawn , chop his wood , fix his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and even drop by his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> to feed his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> grown <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dixie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Husky</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bailiff</ENAMEX> charged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> double-crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> bribe .
     Some of the allegations are simply bizarre .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">grand jury</ENAMEX> they were summoned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chambers</ENAMEX> on separate occasions to take dictation , only to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in his bikini underwear .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> testified that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> once called her to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">office</ENAMEX> while wearing nothing at all .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , vehemently denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery . ''
     He blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courthouse</ENAMEX> 's docket and a vendetta by state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> angered by some of his rulings against them .
     `` I do n't know whose toes I 've stepped on , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . ''
     Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> .
     That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurists</ENAMEX> in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who frequently bring business to a country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courthouse</ENAMEX> can expect to appear before the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year</TIMEX> .
     Fear of alienating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> is pervasive , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Geiger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Rural Justice Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montpelier</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vt.</ENAMEX> , a public interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that researches rural justice issues .
     As a result , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> think twice before appealing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's ruling , are reluctant to mount , or even support , challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's integrity .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> , a stern and forbidding-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fixture</ENAMEX> in the local legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two decades</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of an immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stonemason</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Slovenian</ENAMEX> descent , he was raised in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">borough</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> seat , and put himself through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Pittsburgh Law School</ENAMEX> .
     He graduated near the top of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> , serving on the school law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">review</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Thornburgh</ENAMEX> , who went on to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and , now , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> .
     It was also in law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> had the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> .
     He divorced his first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> and married the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of his court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P.

''
     Clearly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> has had his share of accomplishments .
     After practicing law locally , he was elected to his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> term as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> ; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , he was effectively re-elected .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Six years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> was voted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> .
     He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> vacancies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> .
     And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> seat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pennsylvania Bar Association</ENAMEX> rated him `` one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">best</ENAMEX> available , '' after interviewing local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> . `` He probably was the smartest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-member bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> , who , like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> , refuses to talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> publicly .
     `` He 's sharp as a tack .
     He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ''
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a decade</TIMEX> , virtually no one complained about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> . `` What about those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> that are supposed to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bedrock</ENAMEX> of society , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bar association</ENAMEX> ... ?

     `` If only a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> had spoken out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years ago</TIMEX> , the judicial process would n't be under the taint it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">arm</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> that investigates judicial misconduct , counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> . `` Nobody told us ; nobody called us , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> close to the case who asked not to be named .
     `` Nobody had the guts to complain . ''
     Certainly not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Johnstown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J.

     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> never made a pretense of repaying the money , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> .
     Eventually , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> testified , he began ducking out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> rather than face the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> when he visited .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> won a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240,000</NUMEX> verdict in a land condemnation case against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1983</TIMEX> , he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> unexpectedly awarded him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 100,000</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> thought little of it , he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">grand jury</ENAMEX> , until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> walked up to him after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtroom</ENAMEX> had cleared and suggested a kickback .
     `` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or part of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> asked him .
     Appalled , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> never paid the money , he testified .
     But he did n't complain to the state 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Judicial Inquiry and Review Board</ENAMEX> , either , saying later that he feared retribution .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> said he will respond to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> 's allegation at his trial .
     Like most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> who had dealings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> declined to be interviewed for this article .
     And no one with a complaint about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> would allow his name to be printed . `` I do n't have anything much to say , and I think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here , '' says local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward F.

     Says another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> : `` The practice of law is a matter of biting one 's lip when you live in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> .
     One had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> was considered imperious , abrasive and ambitious , those who practiced before him say .
     He sipped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tea</ENAMEX> sweetened with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">honey</ENAMEX> from his high-backed leather chair at his bench , while scribbling notes ordering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtroom</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Four years ago</TIMEX> , he jailed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Cambria County School Board</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> after they defied his order to extend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the school year</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several weeks</TIMEX> to make up for time lost during a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> ' strike .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chambers</ENAMEX> say he could cite precisely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president judge</ENAMEX> , giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> the seniority required to take over as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> 's top court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , they say , was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments .
     `` My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> told a car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> when he bought a new red <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Sunbird</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1984</TIMEX> , according to the grand-jury report .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> dutifully recorded the sale under the name `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Kicki</ENAMEX> . '' Yet , despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's imperial bearing , no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bognato</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-member bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> . `` The arrogance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> , his demeanor , the way he handles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not a basis for filing a complaint , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bognato</ENAMEX> .
     `` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . ''
     State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> dispute that view now , particularly in light of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's various business dealings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> came under scrutiny in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , after the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> general 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Cambria County</ENAMEX> .
     The inquiry soon focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> .
     Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> bought his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Sunbird</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> had `` certain apprehensions '' about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's reputation , according to the grand-jury report .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ebensburg</ENAMEX> 's local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lender</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laurel Bank</ENAMEX> .
     Then , as an additional precaution , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's photograph as he stood next to his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents .
     But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> received his payment book , he disavowed the deal .
     `` There was no loan , there is no loan , there never shall be a loan , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> on his judicial stationery , according to the report .
     Later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> went a step farther .
     After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laurel Bank</ENAMEX> tried to repossess the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> wrote again .
     `` I find myself in an adversary relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laurel Bank</ENAMEX> , and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> wrote back in a letter attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">grand jury</ENAMEX> 's report .
     `` Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laurel bank</ENAMEX> in the near future , I may be inclined to reconsider your request ... . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> now says it was `` unfortunate '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to extort there . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> acquiesced .
     It refinanced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's loan , lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade-in that had n't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Citation</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealer</ENAMEX> had to repair before it could be resold .
     The incident was n't the only time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> got special treatment from his local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Two years later</TIMEX> , he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> loan was `` absolutely onerous . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul L. Kane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laurel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> at the time , quickly responded .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , he wrote back , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</NUMEX> , `` as a concession to you . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial , although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> believe , he would be far wealthier than he is .
     His <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-bedroom cedar and brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Johnstown</ENAMEX> is up for sale to pay for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> says he is confident he will return to his old bench .
     Already , he notes , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> .
     Most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> as part of a pre-trial agreement .
     The heart of the case -- `` official oppression '' -- remains intact .
     `` If I lose , I lose my position , my career , my pension , my home and my investments , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> .
     `` My God and I know I am correct and innocent .

     Although the action removes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case , it also means that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tax Court</ENAMEX> rules against him in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> case heard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C .</ENAMEX>

     Regarding Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's taxes , he and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> would get <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> would go to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Hartt III</ENAMEX> , a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , warned that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> stood to lose certain oil and gas properties , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> pottery , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">condominium</ENAMEX> and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has found another safe outlet for its money : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> home mortgages .
     An increasing number of big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known as mortgage-backed securities .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">As much as 10 %</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> mortgage securities issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> , now flow into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hands</ENAMEX> .
     That may not come as a surprise to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who have watched the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> snap up properties in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> from golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">courses</ENAMEX> to a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> .
     But it marks a big change for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , who shunned mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years back</TIMEX> . `` You ca n't say it 's a `` tsunami '' -LRB- tidal wave -RRB- , but we 're making some headway , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David O.

     The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here .
     Evidence of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> demand for mortgage securities abounds .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , had no trouble selling out a special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</NUMEX> mortgage-securities trust it created for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .

     And a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> seminar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> promises to draw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , who can be expected to channel <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of billions of dollars</NUMEX> into the market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years</TIMEX> . `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , there were only several big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> who were interested , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinji Kato</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Securities Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are changing their policies and investing a lot . ''
     Ultimately , he says , strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities .
     At the moment , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> authorized to act as a primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> instruments .

     These securities are attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , they are safe .
     While they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds are , it is widely assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would support them if necessary .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , they are liquid .
     The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.2 trillion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> residential mortgages issued .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> , they offer high yields .
     At the moment , some offer as much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6 to 1.8</NUMEX> percentage points over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities of similar maturities .
     But there is a risk , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nearly five years ago</TIMEX> .
     Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity .
     That 's a headache for long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , since it forces them to reinvest their money -- usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two or three years ago</TIMEX> , the problem was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did n't understand the prepayment risk , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kato</ENAMEX> .
     `` So they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment . ''
     Compounding the trouble to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , mortgage securities pay interest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> , since most mortgages require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> to make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> payments .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are used to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">semiannual</TIMEX> payments on their investments , so the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> cash flow posed administrative problems .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> steered clear of the mortgage securities .
     But they did n't lose touch with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have bought <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 80 %</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> corporate debt issued to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> , money that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> uses to buy mortgages from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> took up nearly all of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits , a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation , that were offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     In addition , further packaging of mortgage-backed securities , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX> 's fund , have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> payments so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> do n't have to .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> and offers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">semiannual</TIMEX> payments .
