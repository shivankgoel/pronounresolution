     Influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's sale of sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     The bill , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , would prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> from raising temporary working capital by having an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX>-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
     The bill intends to restrict the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> borrowings only , unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> receives specific congressional authorization . `` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> borrowing , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortney Stark</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the bill 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> .
     The complex financing plan in the S&amp;L bailout law includes raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</NUMEX> from debt issued by the newly created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> .
     This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Another $ 20 billion</NUMEX> would be raised through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
     That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 166 billion</NUMEX> including interest over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> . `` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cooke</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> has already spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 19 billion</NUMEX> selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> insolvent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;Ls</ENAMEX> , and it is likely to sell or merge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> by the time the bailout concludes .
     Absent other working capital , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .
     `` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said .
     The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
     The law does allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> to borrow from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 5 billion</NUMEX> at any time .
     Moreover , it says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> 's total obligations may not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 billion</NUMEX> , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> holds .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> 's working-capital plan , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schumer</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC Oversight Board</ENAMEX> has been remiss in not keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> informed .
     `` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RTC</ENAMEX> is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hill</ENAMEX> if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> will hold a hearing on the bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> .

     We 're about to see if advertising works .
     Hard on the heels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
     Their mission is to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> from fleeing the market , as individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> did in droves after the crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX>
     Just days after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> rushed out ads to calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     This time around , they 're moving even faster .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> filmed a new television commercial at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and had it on the air by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> placed new ads in newspapers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , and wrote another new ad appearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> had already written new TV ads .
     It considered running them during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Other brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .
     The brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
     This time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> were ready .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> , for example , prepared ads <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months ago</TIMEX> in case of a market plunge .
     When the market went into its free fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> ordered full pages in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> editions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     The ads touted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> 's automated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800</ENAMEX>-number beneath the huge headline , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call</ENAMEX> . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800</ENAMEX>-line , which already was operating but which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> .
     `` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says .
     `` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
     It would have been too late to think about on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     We had to think about it ahead of time . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> ad goes a step further , encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to stay in the market or even to plunge in with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> .
     Underneath the headline `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Diversification</ENAMEX> , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> , all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . ''
     It goes on to plug a few diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> funds by name .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     In the aftermath of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> debacle , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX> .
     It also negotiated an arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> would agree to air its last-minute creations .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> commercial , created with ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> , features <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Farrell</ENAMEX> , one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's most visible investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> , sounding particularly bullish .
     Taped just as the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , it offers Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrell</ENAMEX> advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .
     We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . ''
     The spot was scheduled to appear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .
     Instead , it settled on just urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market . `` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lampe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of advertising .
     `` If you owned it and liked it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the true value has n't changed . ''
     He adds , `` This is n't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> revisited . ''
     With the market fluctuating and then closing up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 88</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> had to constantly revise their approach .
     At Shearson Lehman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> created potential new commercials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , then had to regroup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .
     The plan had been to make one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's easy-to-film , black-and-white `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Where We Stand</ENAMEX> '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     The ad would have run during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's new ad campaign , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Leadership by Example</ENAMEX> . ''
     But in a meeting after the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .
     `` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathleen B. Stewart</ENAMEX> , executive vic<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">e pres</ENAMEX>ident of marketing .
     In any case , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> ran from the market en masse .
     Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .
     Ad Notes ... .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ARNOLD ADVERTISING</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Eskandarian</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina , McNamee WCRS</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arnold Advertising</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Verret</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , will retain the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .

     You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ?
     It 's what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo Jackson</ENAMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two feet</NUMEX> deep ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -RRB- predicts that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> placed before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> pianos would produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,118</NUMEX> publishable rock 'n' roll tunes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX> , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> that dumped runs by the bushel on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National League</ENAMEX> playoffs was held to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> games by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">home-team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">gang</ENAMEX> that had been done unto similarly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Dodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orel Hershiser</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's tournament .
     Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> who had some catching up to do .
     In game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , on a cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> in this land of perpetual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn</TIMEX> , a lot of the catching up was done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> catcher , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Steinbach</ENAMEX> .
     He hit a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> pitch from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Reuschel</ENAMEX> into the left-field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands</ENAMEX> in inning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to stretch his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's lead from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to a decisive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , where it stayed .
     So what if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbach</ENAMEX> had struck just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> home runs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> regular-season games , and batted in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> lineup .
     `` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , quite a few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McGwire</ENAMEX> , the big , red-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baseman</ENAMEX> , had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hits in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> at bats , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more than he 'd had in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-game <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Dodger</ENAMEX> series in which he 'd gone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">A-men</ENAMEX> batting Nos. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> hits and scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of its runs in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> decision .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Right-hander</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Stewart</ENAMEX> held the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hits to account for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> on the other side of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> ledger .
     That he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> winningest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> during its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American League</ENAMEX> campaign with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> mark , plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wins over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Toronto</ENAMEX> in the playoffs , indicates he may have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">some evening</TIMEX> up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     The same goes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Moore</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> who overcame early struggles to permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> but a run and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hits in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> innings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> 's contest . `` Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> they put out there had a better split-finger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> before , '' marveled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Craig</ENAMEX> .
     He 's an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-hurler</ENAMEX> who 's one of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus</ENAMEX> of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
     The upshot of the downshoot is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> go into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> tonight up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> games to none in the best-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> fest .
     The stat to reckon with here says that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clubs</ENAMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> -RRB- that took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> leads went on to win it all .
     That 's not an average to soothe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rooters</ENAMEX> .
     One might think that the home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series of the Subway Called BART</ENAMEX> -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Desire</ENAMEX> , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Partisans</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">combatants</ENAMEX> sat side by side in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49,000-plus</NUMEX> seats of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Oakland Coliseum</ENAMEX> , and while they cheered their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> and booed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
     A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'm for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> today , but only because they lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     I love 'em both . The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> to go <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> games , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Williams</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">septuagenarian</ENAMEX> , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Coliseum</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> 's go .
     The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
     I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> , is originally from somewhere else .
     Suffice it to say that if this were a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Yankees</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mets</ENAMEX> series , or one between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">White Sox</ENAMEX> -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in every other seat to separate opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .
     Anyway , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> gave you a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> to root for .
     In the opening game , besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbach</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> , there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Weiss</ENAMEX> , a twiggy-looking , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-year <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shortstop</ENAMEX> who had lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a couple months of the season</TIMEX> to knee surgery .
     He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> -RRB- , moved a runner along in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-run <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> inning , and homered for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's final tally .
     Such is his reputation among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">East Bay Bashers</ENAMEX> that when he hit his first career home run <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last season</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .
     Not his autograph ; power-hitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> 's .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-hero</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> game was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rickey Henderson</ENAMEX> , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation .
     He smoked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Toronto</ENAMEX> in the playoffs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> hits , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> walks and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> stolen bases in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> at bats , and continued that by going <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> at the plate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .
     `` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured .
     The cold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in the set were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Clark</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Mitchell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Williams</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitters</ENAMEX> .
     They combined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> hits , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> home runs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> runs batted in in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> games against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs</ENAMEX> .
     They went a collective <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-</NUMEX>for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> here , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> homers and ribbies .
     It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> hope in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> games to come .
     `` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> batting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dusty Baker</ENAMEX> after game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     `` I 'd rather see a so-so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> who 's cold . ''
     But the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Dodger</ENAMEX> slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .
     `` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said .
     `` That 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR Corp.</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .
     Net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93.1 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 103.1 million</NUMEX> , roughly what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected .
     But per-share profit dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.23</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.26</NUMEX> a share , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> continued its stock buy-back plan .
     Average shares outstanding dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75.8 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82.1 million</NUMEX> .
     Revenue fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.39 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.41 billion</NUMEX> .
     The computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , which sells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> its goods outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , also said the negative effect of a stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar will `` adversely affect '' its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> performance and `` make it difficult '' to better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> said revenue declined both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , however , said orders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> showed `` good gains '' during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> estimate those gains at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % to 13 %</NUMEX> , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> 's major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">customers</ENAMEX> . In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanjiv G. Hingorani</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc .</ENAMEX>
     These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current quarter</TIMEX> 's results , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> said .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier fourth quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> had profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 149.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.85</NUMEX> a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hingorani</ENAMEX> said he lowered his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full-year</TIMEX> estimates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.35</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.50</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue projections were slashed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.03 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.20 billion</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 439.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.33</NUMEX> a share , on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.99 billion</NUMEX> in revenue .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , the company 's earnings fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 264.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.40</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 289.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.49</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenues declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.17 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.19 billion</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCR</ENAMEX> shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57</NUMEX> .

     Concerning your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 19</TIMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance</ENAMEX> , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?
     Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> , and pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> a base salary with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> bonus based on how much money they made for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> ?
     That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ''
     For many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , it was a day that started nervously in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the small hours</TIMEX> .
     By lunchtime , the selling was at near-panic fever .
     But as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">City</ENAMEX> breathed a sigh of relief .
     So it went <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in the trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's financial district .
     In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market was considered especially vulnerable .
     And before the opening of trading here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , all eyes were on early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be .
     By the time trading officially got under way at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 a.m.</TIMEX> , the news from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> was in .
     And it left mixed signals for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> on thin volume ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> stocks declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> in orderly trading .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies</ENAMEX> ' trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Finsbury Circus</ENAMEX> , a stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">circle</ENAMEX> at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .
     Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
     Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> , as the index opened at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2076.8</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157.1</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> . `` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palamara</ENAMEX> , a big , good-humored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> who runs the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-trader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk . `` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Smith</ENAMEX> , who heads trading in all non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks .
     `` We tend to run a very tight book . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies</ENAMEX> spent most of its energies in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> trying to match <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> , and there were n't many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     `` All the takeover stocks -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish &amp; Newcastle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DRG</ENAMEX> -- are getting pretty well pasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Seconds</TIMEX> later , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,500</NUMEX>-share `` sell '' order for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scottish &amp; Newcastle</ENAMEX> came in .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> next to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette .
     On the screens , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 140</NUMEX> .
     `` Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said .
     He targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,500</NUMEX> shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> and punched a button to call up on his screen other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> ' price quotes .
     The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">845 pence</NUMEX> , -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.27</NUMEX> -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> started putting out feelers .
     But the market sensed a serious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyer</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day</TIMEX> dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">850 pence</NUMEX> .
     `` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said .
     `` It 's very frustrating . ''

     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> , it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 a.m.</TIMEX> in New York , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> fielded a call from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> wanting an opinion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> market break .
     `` Fundamentally dangerous ... , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said , almost in a whisper , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely dangerously poised ...
     we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . ''
     He was right .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market was in full retreat . `` It 's falling like a stone , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Linger</ENAMEX> , a pit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> who was standing outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London International Financial Futures Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only half</NUMEX> the usual lunchtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> gathered at the tony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Corney &amp; Barrow</ENAMEX> wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bar</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Old Broad Street</ENAMEX> nearby .
     Conversation was subdued as most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> watched the latest market statistics on television .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:49 p.m.</TIMEX> , the index hit its low , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2029.7</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204.2</NUMEX> points .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> opened the limit down , off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 10 %</NUMEX> if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , said early in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .

     As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:30 p.m.</TIMEX> -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> traded bets on how low the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> market would open .
     In the center of the trading floor , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Streeter</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> scrambled for the telephones as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> market opened -- plummeting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few minutes</TIMEX> .
     They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off .
     As Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> dumped American Depositary Receipts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Streeter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Ruiz</ENAMEX> bought them to resell in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K</ENAMEX> .

     Suddenly , after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 45 minutes</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> markets rallied .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MMI</ENAMEX> has gone better , '' shouted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3:15</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout .
     As Wall Street strengthened , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">room</ENAMEX> went wild .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Aviation Subcommittee</ENAMEX> approved a bill that would give the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> .
     The collapsed plan to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on a voice vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The bill is expected to be taken up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Public Works and Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , and a floor vote by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> will be urged .
     The measure drew criticism from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and a parting shot from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> , who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> withdrew his takeover bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     In a letter to subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberstar</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minn.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Chao</ENAMEX> , deputy transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , also sent a letter to express the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oberstar</ENAMEX> brushed off Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''
     He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's position .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oberstar</ENAMEX> and other committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
     But they cited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Aides</ENAMEX> both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> said the withdrawal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation . `` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> .
     The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out .
     Currently , the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
     In general , the bill would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-day</TIMEX> review period before <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> or more of the voting stock of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> could be acquired .
     It also would require the acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party</ENAMEX> to notify the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
     The bill would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
     If more information is needed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> would have authority to extend the review period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 days</TIMEX> .
     All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> , both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiteers</ENAMEX> from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .
     But several committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> disapproved , some backing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal and the stock-market plunge .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entities</ENAMEX> and producing independent spin-off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have further reason for optimism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> rebound .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Frankfurt Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , which closed before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> opened , was the hardest hit of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> markets , with the DAX Index dropping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.8 %</NUMEX> .

     Prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled .
     Following is a breakdown of major market activity :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">FRANKFURT</ENAMEX> :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the sharpest declines came in the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's strongest economy .
     The DAX Index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> blue chips plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.8 %</NUMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> record , wiping out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> 's gains .
     The index closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1385.72</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203.56</NUMEX> points .
     By comparison , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , the new index would have dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.4 %</NUMEX> , according to a projection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> may have reacted so strongly to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's losing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> of its value in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash and its wake .
     This time , however , many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may have been hurt by acting so swiftly . `` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Insam</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank in Liechtenstein</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> .
     He said he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to buy selected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> blue chips after they fell by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> .
     After the opening was delayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> because of the crush of sell orders , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> 's normal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> trading session was extended <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">75 minutes</TIMEX> to handle the heavy volume . `` The beginning was chaotic , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Longley</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commerzbank AG</ENAMEX> .
     `` It took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-quarters of an hour</TIMEX> before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . ''
     Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bankers</ENAMEX> , many of whom spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night before</TIMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">offices</ENAMEX> watching <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Far Eastern</ENAMEX> markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stock prices .
     `` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> . That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norbert Braeuer</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hessische Landesbank</ENAMEX> .
     Some big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , began picking up lower-priced shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> , but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> wanted to see what would happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> before acting .
     But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1657.61</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 8</TIMEX> .
     Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.3 %</NUMEX> drop for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mannesmann AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner Bank AG</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.6 %</NUMEX> decline were especially problematic for their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> , whose plans for major rights issues in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> could now be in jeopardy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner Bank</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> said it hoped to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 billion marks</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 642.2 million</NUMEX> -RRB- by issuing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 marks</NUMEX> each .
     Yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's market cropped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dresdner</ENAMEX> 's share price by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33 marks</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">309 marks</NUMEX> a share , leaving little incentive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">LONDON</ENAMEX> :
     Headed toward a record drop at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> stock market recouped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of its losses in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's early rally .
     The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70.5</NUMEX> points , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163.4</NUMEX> , its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> , after having plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204.2</NUMEX> points at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:49 p.m .</TIMEX>

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.P.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.P. Morgan &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     J.P. Morgan , as expected , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.82 billion</NUMEX> net loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , reflecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     The reserve addition placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.</ENAMEX> among a few major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> with reserves .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The latest quarter</TIMEX> 's loss equals <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.92</NUMEX> a share .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 233.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George M. Salem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , called the results `` mildly disappointing . ''
     Excluding the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> provision and allowing for the taxes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> paid , earnings were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 65 cents</NUMEX> a share , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem</ENAMEX> said .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> climbed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.125</NUMEX> .
     Net interest income sank <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 254 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 347 million</NUMEX> .
     The interest rate on short-term funds , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> borrow to finance longer-term loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , was `` sharply higher , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</NUMEX> of interest payments on its medium and long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35 million</NUMEX> higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> said .
     Such loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina</ENAMEX> also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> of interest income in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> period .
     Income from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> other than interest climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 414 million</NUMEX> , reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
     `` These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related '' income , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> said .
     Non-interest expenses grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 496 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp.</ENAMEX> 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> operations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said earnings rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 143.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.45</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">69 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The latest quarter</TIMEX> included a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">59 cents</NUMEX> a share , related to the purchase of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas National Bank</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> 's problem loans , particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , nonperforming assets jumped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 474.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.43 %</NUMEX> of net loans and leases , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 232.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.13 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Nonperformers totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 230.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.27 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Included in the increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent quarter</TIMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</NUMEX> loan , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the fourth quarter</TIMEX> . ''
     The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast</ENAMEX> operations , as well as a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .
     The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> 's net interest margin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.38 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.80 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.50</NUMEX> a share , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 51</NUMEX> .
     Results were released after the market closed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas National</ENAMEX> , formed from the remnants of of the failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First RepublicBank Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76.9 million</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> 's bottom line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results reflect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> of earnings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 1</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> in new capital during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> to complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas</ENAMEX> purchase , and to acquire several small failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> to fill out its regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , the banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it purchased both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freedom Savings &amp; Loan Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">University Federal Savings Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 169.4 million</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> 's net income climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 310.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.30</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.22</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> 's earnings growth slowed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was still able to post a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
     Net rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.55</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 167.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.47</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the gain resulted mainly from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million</NUMEX> increase in net interest income , reflecting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> rise in consumer loans .
     These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> 's net interest margin fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 13</NUMEX> basis points , a more mild decrease than some major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.625</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     The earnings represent a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.89 %</NUMEX> return on assets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> , and an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.9 %</NUMEX> return on equity .
     The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> increase in net credit losses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 109 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 81.9 million</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .
     Nonperforming loans grew slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.75 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security</ENAMEX> Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30.4 million</NUMEX> , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year before</TIMEX> .
     Non-interest income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , mainly because of an unusual gain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> banking operations .
     Non-interest expense grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4 %</NUMEX> in the period .

     What happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices .
     No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
     But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
     After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> specific circuit breakers : If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> index falls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> will halt trading for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> ; if the decline hits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> points , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> will close for an additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> .
     The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to reconsider their strategies , calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> and lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
     It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
     A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
     But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
     What happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> was the worst of all worlds .
     The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3 p.m.</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stock index had fallen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> index .
     Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , under its own rules , remained open .
     With nowhere else to go , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> , and particularly program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , focused all their selling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
     Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30</TIMEX> , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , the futures exchanges reopened .
     Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:45</TIMEX> , after the futures markets had dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 30</NUMEX> points , which is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> limit for price declines .
     At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     It is time to recognize that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> market effectively .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
     It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
     To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
     Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .
     It 's time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .
     Let 's not have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> market shut down for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> when the Dow declines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> points and another shut down for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>-point decline .
     The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .
     The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> remains open .
     The rules should be established by agreement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodities Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> -LRB- which , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> , regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> stock-index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> .
     In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to handle a decline than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> now has the capacity to handle a volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a billion</NUMEX> shares a day .
     Telephone service has been improved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> trying to reach their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> -- have larger capital positions .
     -LRB- Of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices .
     Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early Friday</TIMEX> and opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB-
     But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> dismissed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> 's suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , however , ruling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Orioles</ENAMEX> innocent of negligent hiring , and not responsible for a fight that was outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> ' employment .

     When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were self-congratulatory about how well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> had gone .
     They said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> could n't have performed better .
     `` We had no operating problems at all , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said after the market closed .
     `` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ''

     While reaching blockbuster proportions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the volume was still well within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 million</NUMEX>-share capacity that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has said it can handle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> since beefing up its computers after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash .
     The so-called circuit breakers devised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> because the markets were higher for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> .
     Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' complaints , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said the links with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures market worked as planned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's rout to provide a cooling-off period .
     Of greater help , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> said , was the `` natural circuit breaker '' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , that provided a breathing period that `` brought rationality back to the market .
