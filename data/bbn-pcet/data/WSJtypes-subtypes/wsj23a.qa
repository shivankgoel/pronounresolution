     No , it was n't <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> did n't fall apart <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX> points -- most of it in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final hour</TIMEX> -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos .
     Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash failed their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> test , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> stock specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> floor -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> of last resort who were criticized after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .
     Big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> by buying big blocks of stock , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say .
     Heavy selling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index futures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> relentlessly beat stocks downward .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> stocks -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities\/ABC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX> -- stopped trading and never resumed .
     The finger-pointing has already begun .
     `` The equity market was illiquid .
     Once again -LCB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> -RCB- were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Pedersen</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Twenty-First Securities Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Countered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Maguire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of specialists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Henderson Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> : `` It is easy to say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialist</ENAMEX> is n't doing his job .
     When the dollar is in a free-fall , even central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ca n't stop it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speculators</ENAMEX> are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . ''
     Many money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> had already left their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> on a warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn day</TIMEX> -- because the stock market was so quiet .
     Then in a lightning plunge , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">barely an hour</TIMEX> surrendered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> of their gains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , chalking up a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> , loss on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> in gargantuan trading volume .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Final-hour</TIMEX> trading accelerated to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108.1 million</NUMEX> shares , a record for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">At the end of the day</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251.2 million</NUMEX> shares were traded .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2569.26</NUMEX> .
     The Dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> crash that occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> .
     In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">12th</NUMEX>-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156.83</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     The Dow fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.6 %</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , were extremely active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all day Friday</TIMEX> , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> buy-out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> by an employee-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     Wall Street 's takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> , or `` risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> , '' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock would rise .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:43 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> , came the sickening news : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> was halting trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , `` pending news . ''
     On the exchange floor , `` as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stopped trading , we braced for a panic , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> top floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading halt came news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> could n't get financing for its bid .
     At this point , the Dow was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35</NUMEX> points .
     The market crumbled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Arbitragers</ENAMEX> could n't dump their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had .
     For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> , which closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 1\/2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 1\/4</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philips Industries</ENAMEX> , which sank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     These stocks eventually reopened .
     But as panic spread , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> began to sell blue-chip stocks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> to offset their losses .
     When trading was halted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> , the stock was trading at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 3\/8</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 5\/8</NUMEX> lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> .
     Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels .
     Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> , including computer-guided program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said most of their major institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , sat tight .
     Now , at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:07</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> futures contract had plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points , equivalent to around a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials .
     Under an agreement signed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , trading was temporarily halted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     After the trading halt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> pit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> continued to notch prices down .
     As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .
     Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> think the overall stock market is headed -- many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     The futures halt was even assailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     `` It screwed things up , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> .
     This confusion effectively halted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings .
     -LRB- In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -RRB-
     `` When the airline information came through , it cracked every model we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the largest program-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     `` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ''
     But stocks kept falling .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> points at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 p.m.</TIMEX> before the futures-trading halt .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30 p.m.</TIMEX> , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114.76</NUMEX> points .
     Meanwhile , during the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> trading halt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures sell orders began piling up , while stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> kept falling sharply .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically .
     I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
     Under another post-crash system , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Grasso </ENAMEX>-LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> was flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bangkok</ENAMEX> as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an `` inter-exchange hot line '' to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> .
     He camped out at a high-tech nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3:30 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Buyers</ENAMEX> stepped in to the futures pit .
     But the build-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3:45</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> market careened to still another limit , of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> points down , and trading was locked again .
     Futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> was signaling that the Dow could fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 200</NUMEX> points .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> , small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> began ringing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , wondering whether another crash had begun .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , which is trying to cater to small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , some demoralized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> thought this would be the final confidence-crusher .
     That 's when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George L. Ball</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only `` mechanical . ''
     `` I have a hunch that this particular decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> is something ` more ado about less . '
     It would be my inclination to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ball</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's biggest brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , a news release was prepared headlined `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop</ENAMEX> . ''
     The release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey B. Lane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> , said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge is `` going to set back '' relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , `` because it reinforces the concern of volatility .
     And I think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will harp on program trading .
     It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . ''
     As the Dow average ground to its final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX> loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> pit stayed locked at its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-point trading limit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Yass</ENAMEX> of program trader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Susquehanna Investment Group</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 330 million</NUMEX> in stock .
     But there were no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's debacle involved mainly professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself .
     At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks .
     But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grasso</ENAMEX> said , `` Our systemic performance was good . ''
     But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> in all stocks .
     Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations were n't met , '' he said .

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> complain privately that just as in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , the `` upstairs '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -- big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's blood-letting .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said , `` It will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> '' to analyze who was buying and selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .

     `` We do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Campbell</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of mergers and acquisitions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoare Govett</ENAMEX> , in an interview .

     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">consortium</ENAMEX> , the bid was code-named Project Klute , a reference to the film `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Klute</ENAMEX> '' in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX> played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Fonda</ENAMEX> is saved from a psychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> by a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Klute</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> was a small home-building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> was hired to push it into commercial development .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> grew modestly until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , when a majority position in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> was acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Herscu</ENAMEX> , currently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herscu</ENAMEX> proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill-fated , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> acquisition binge that included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.

     Eventually Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herscu</ENAMEX> had a falling out over the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> said he resigned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> has sold its interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and is currently attempting to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.

     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Sakowitz</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sakowitz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> , is seeking funds to buy out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker</ENAMEX> interest in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .

     Reached in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Honolulu</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shidler</ENAMEX> said that he believes the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">malls</ENAMEX> can become profitable with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     `` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shidler</ENAMEX> .

     As small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , big fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash .
     Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests .
     And many fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just half</NUMEX> the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> preceding <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> said stock-fund redemptions were running at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one-third</NUMEX> the level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , the redemptions represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15 %</NUMEX> of the total cash position of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> 's stock funds .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> there were massive redemption levels over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> and a lot of fear around , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Bruce Johnstone</ENAMEX> , who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equity-Income Fund</ENAMEX> .
     `` This feels more like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-shot deal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are n't panicking . ''
     The test may come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's stock market sell-off came too late for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to act .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> have held off until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> because any fund exchanges made after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's close would take place at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's closing prices .
     Stock fund redemptions during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     But fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say they 're ready .
     Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli</ENAMEX> , for instance , holds cash positions well above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> in several of his funds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Windsor Fund</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Neff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mutual Series</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Price</ENAMEX> said they had raised their cash levels to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 % and 30 %</NUMEX> , respectively , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lynch</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.7 billion</NUMEX> Magellan Fund , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest stock fund , built up cash to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 850 million</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason is that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years of monthly</TIMEX> net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     `` I 've let the money build up , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes .
     Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course .
     As a group , stock funds held <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2 %</NUMEX> of assets in cash as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the latest figures available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Investment Company Institute</ENAMEX> .
     That was modestly higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 % and 9.2 %</NUMEX> levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September of 1987</TIMEX> .
     Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to dump stocks to raise cash .
     But a strong level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said .
     A major reason is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     Stock-fund sales have rebounded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> net purchases are still running at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> levels .
     `` There 's not nearly as much froth , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bogle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , a big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Valley Forge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Many fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> argue that now 's the time to buy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Bajakian</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> Wellington Fund , added to his positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol-Myers Squibb</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Home Products</ENAMEX> whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> , for his part , snapped up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southern Co.</ENAMEX> shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> after the stock got hammered .
     If the market drops further <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol-Myers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> .
     `` If they croak stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an opportunity that is `` the kind of thing you dream about . ''
     Major mutual-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekend</TIMEX> pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were seeking share prices and other information .
     Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal .
     Still , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are n't taking any chances .
     They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> opened its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> walk-in investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers</ENAMEX> normally are closed through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers</ENAMEX> will open at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:30 EDT this morning</TIMEX> , instead of the normal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> increased its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to handle investor requests .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> noted that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> moved money from stock funds to money-market funds .
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> seemed to be `` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Norwitz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard</ENAMEX> , among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> , said it was adding more phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> get through .
     In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> with recordings on their toll-free phone lines .
     `` We view -LCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's -RCB- market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , '' a recording at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gabelli &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> funds said over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Janus Group</ENAMEX> had a similar recording for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Several fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> expect a rough market <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> before prices stabilize .
     Some early selling is likely to stem from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who want to lock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's fat profits .
     Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical Services Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Garzarelli</ENAMEX> , who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 335 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sector Analysis Portfolio</ENAMEX> , predicts the market will open down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50</NUMEX> points on technical factors and `` some panic selling . ''
     But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> she expects the stock market wo n't decline <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 % to 15 %</NUMEX> from recent highs .
     `` This is not a major crash , '' she said .
     Nevertheless , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garzarelli</ENAMEX> said she was swamped with phone calls over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> from nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but I 'm trying to talk them out of it . ''
     She added , `` If they all were bullish , I 'd really be upset . ''
     The backdrop to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's slide was markedly different from that of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> argue .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say .
     `` From the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' standpoint , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 580 million</NUMEX> T.

     Ripples from the strike by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> reached air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West Airlines</ENAMEX> announced it will postpone its new service out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> because of delays in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Otradovec</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for planning at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> , said in an interview that the work stoppage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> , now entering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its 13th day</TIMEX> , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who were booked to fly out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West</ENAMEX> would now be put on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otradovec</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757</ENAMEX> it was supposed to get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this Thursday</TIMEX> would n't be delivered until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 7</TIMEX> -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> had been planning to initiate service at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">four daily</TIMEX> flights , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nonstops to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nonstop to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> .
     Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is also supposed to send to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West</ENAMEX> another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757</ENAMEX> twin-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">737</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> .
     Those , too , are almost certain to arrive late .
     At this point , no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West</ENAMEX> flights -- including its new service at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palmdale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -- have been affected by the delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> deliveries .
     Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> can have on other parts of the economy .
     It also is sure to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> put added pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     `` I just do n't feel that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Baker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">District 751</ENAMEX> , said in an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     `` I do n't think their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">customers</ENAMEX> would like it very much . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">America West</ENAMEX> , though , is a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> than many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> would be .
     `` I figure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> probably have such a hard time counting all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">fleets</ENAMEX> , they might not miss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at all , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otradovec</ENAMEX> said .
     Indeed , a random check <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">737-300</TIMEX> set for delivery at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this month</TIMEX> and expects to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> on time .
     `` It 's so close to completion , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's told us there wo n't be a problem , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has assured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> it will deliver a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757</ENAMEX> on time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American</ENAMEX> is preparing to take delivery of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early December</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has been in constant communication with all of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">customers</ENAMEX> and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> and non-striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have been trying to finish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> -- mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767</ENAMEX> jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jets</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Everett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> -- that were all but completed before the walkout .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> had been delivered and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747-400</ENAMEX> , was supposed to be flown out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air China</ENAMEX> .
     No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table .
     `` We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Hammond</ENAMEX> , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> who has been in contact with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sides</ENAMEX> since the strike began .
     The investment community , for one , has been anticipating a speedy resolution .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , it actually has risen over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last two weeks</TIMEX> on the strength of new orders .
     `` The market has taken <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> in the long term , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rubel</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's shares fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.375</NUMEX> in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this month</TIMEX> , hinting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> may resume negotiations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as this week</TIMEX> .
     Still , he said , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer .
     `` I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Shrontz</ENAMEX> sent striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> a letter , saying that `` to my knowledge , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's offer represents the best overall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> contract of any major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in recent history . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> called the letter -- and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's offer of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . ''
     He added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> miscalculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's resolve and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ' disgust with being forced to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours overtime</TIMEX> .
     In separate developments : -- Talks have broken off between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calabasas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> is continuing to work through its expired contract , however .
     It had planned a strike vote for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Sunday</TIMEX> , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Auto Workers Local 1069</ENAMEX> , which represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Delaware County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , said it agreed to extend its contract on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-by-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> basis , with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-day</TIMEX> notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining .
     The accord expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     -- And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> said it received an order from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Martinair Holland</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767-300</ENAMEX> wide-body <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">jetliners</ENAMEX> valued at a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 326 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes</ENAMEX> , long range versions of the medium-haul <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">twin-jet</ENAMEX> , will be delivered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pratt &amp; Whitney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">PW4060</ENAMEX> engines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pratt &amp; Whitney</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Technologies Inc .</ENAMEX>

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said a delivery date for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes</ENAMEX> is still being worked out `` for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike . ''

     `` The projects are big .
     They can be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 1 billion</NUMEX> plus , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> said .
     `` But we would n't go into them alone , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities</ENAMEX> ' equity stake would be small , he said .

     The planned electric utility sale , scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , is alone expected to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13 billion</NUMEX> , making it the world 's largest public offering .
     Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> , and for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">another 10 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1994 and 1998</TIMEX> .

     `` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> said , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities</ENAMEX> hopes to capitalize on it .
     `` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Utilities</ENAMEX> is also mulling projects in underdeveloped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , though he would be specific .

     By setting up the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaufman &amp; Broad</ENAMEX> can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karatz</ENAMEX> said .

     When the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> took off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum Chemical Corp.</ENAMEX> went along for the ride .
     The timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hoyt Stookey</ENAMEX> , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> outpaced much of the chemical industry as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> profit grew fivefold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey</ENAMEX> said of the boom , `` It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . ''
     But now prices have nose-dived and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's profit is plummeting .
     Some securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are looking for no better than break-even results from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.92</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 724.4 million</NUMEX> .
     The stock , having lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a quarter</NUMEX> of its value since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 1</TIMEX> , closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 34.375</NUMEX> share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.125</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     To a degree , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> represents <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the new times</TIMEX> that have arrived for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of the so-called commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> that pervade modern life .
     Having just passed through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most profitable periods in their history , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> now see their prices eroding .
     Pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> .
     And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .
     `` We were all wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     `` Now we 're at the bottom of the heap . ''
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , the trouble is magnified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's heavy dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> .
     Once known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey</ENAMEX> took the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> 's job in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">59 years old</TIMEX> , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> will prosper through its new direction .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">resin</ENAMEX> , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> polyethylene market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> has claimed the largest share , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> .
     But its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> and several oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings .
     When the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> moves <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a mere penny</NUMEX> a pound , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> profit fluctuates by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 85 cents</NUMEX> a share , provided no other variables are changing .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , even more than that of other commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> , has taken a dive .
     Benchmark grades , which still sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 50 cents</NUMEX> a pound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , have skidded to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 35 cents and 40 cents</NUMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene</ENAMEX> , the chemical building block of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , has n't dropped nearly so fast .
     That discrepancy hurts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> badly , because its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</NUMEX> of its ethylene needs .
     By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the start of this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , which had been putting in huge orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , abruptly halted them .
     Calculating that excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> would soon be sloshing around the world , other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">product</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Mitchell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> 's polyethylene business , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were even hoarding bags , '' he says .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> hope prices have hit bottom .
     They recently announced increases of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few cents</NUMEX> a pound to take effect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next several weeks</TIMEX> .
     No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> start to haggle .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubter</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Krug</ENAMEX> , a chemical-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> on plastics stocks .
     Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` Some say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> .
     Some say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> .
     I say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> . ''
     He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> ' plans to expand production capacity .
     A quick turnaround is crucial to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> because its cash requirements remain heavy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is trying to carry out a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> plant-expansion program started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     At the same time , its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> payments on long-term debt will more than double from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 240 million</NUMEX> , largely because of debt taken on to pay a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50</NUMEX>-a-share special dividend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation .
     Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to cut its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> dividend , raised <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only a year ago</TIMEX> , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stookey</ENAMEX> deflected dividend questions in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 29</TIMEX> meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     Some viewed his response -- that company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance .
     In any case , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's shares slid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.625</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36.625</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading .
     On top of everything else , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> confronts a disaster at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill .</ENAMEX>
     After an explosion idled the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> progressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it .
     Then a second explosion occurred .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> died and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> .
     This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's fortunes .
     Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards .
     A prolonged production halt at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> could introduce another imponderable into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's financial future .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward .
     But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">insured</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> -- when demand is shifting .
     `` You say you could have sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X percent</NUMEX> of this product and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y percent</NUMEX> of that , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Semegran</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> who went through this exercise during his former career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> .
     `` And then you still have to negotiate . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , where limited production got under way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , will resume full operation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> usually accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % to 25 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> 's polyethylene production and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of its ethylene production .
     Not everything looks grim for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>.
     The plant expansion should strengthen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity .
     By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's raw material costs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> is also tightening its grip on its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> , propane marketing .
     Through a venture with its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> an acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Inc.</ENAMEX> in a transaction valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.18 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">propane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The largest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suburban Propane</ENAMEX> , was already owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> has a crisis to get past right now .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> .
     The name surfacing in rumors is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Asked about a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says , `` We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has negotiated a significant cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> , similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market than it had under the previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> steel quotas , which expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela</ENAMEX> are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> that have n't completed steel talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> have supplied <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">100 million tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .

     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> that do n't have formal steel quotas with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Sweden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina</ENAMEX> , also have supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> .
     Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> have in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> made informal agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> that are similar to quotas .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31 , 1992</TIMEX> .
     It also said it would use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">that two-and-a-half year</TIMEX> period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> to conclude its steel talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , virtually doubled its quota to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.95 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel market from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.48 %</NUMEX> under the previous quotas .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , which had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9 %</NUMEX> under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1.95 %</NUMEX> .
     That increase rises to slightly more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market if a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel project is included .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> is expected to increase its allowance from the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.43 %</NUMEX> share it has had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's largest steel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">suppliers</ENAMEX> -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> steel industry , which has been coping with strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> demand , has been supplying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market compared with recent quotas of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.7 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has been shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> to total <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4.5 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market compared with a quota of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.9 %</NUMEX> .
     In the recent talks , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> had its quota increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 300,000 tons</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     But its quota has been as high as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , however , has agreed to cut its quota to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.9 %</NUMEX> previously .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> imported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> under the quota program .
     The balance is supplied by a host of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">exporters</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about an extra 2 %</NUMEX> of the domestic steel market to give to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">suppliers</ENAMEX> in its quota talks .
     That was essentially made up of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> increase in the overall quota program and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> from cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's allowance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Negotiators</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> will repeat these quota negotiations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> when they will have another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel market to allocate .
     These optional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's steel-quota program to give its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> leverage with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">suppliers</ENAMEX> to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel Inc.</ENAMEX> expects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal second-quarter</TIMEX> earnings to trail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a `` much stronger '' performance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its second half</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> , a telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 272,000</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> a share , in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     Revenue totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pierce</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , said in an interview that earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent quarter</TIMEX> will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two cents</NUMEX> a share on revenue of just under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</NUMEX> .
     The lower results , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> said , reflect a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-month</TIMEX> decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> 's primary business .
     Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> expects that line of business to strengthen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> , he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> will also benefit from moving into other areas .
     Foremost among those is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's entrance into the public facsimile business , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> said .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> expects to place <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> fax machines , made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minolta</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> , municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">drugstores</ENAMEX> and other public settings around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> should realize a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls .
     Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> said , not just phones produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elcotel</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobbies</ENAMEX> , office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobbies</ENAMEX> , hospitality <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounges</ENAMEX> and similar settings .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5</NUMEX> of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .

     Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> plans to begin testing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> that will require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">only a few spoonfuls</NUMEX> per washload .
     The move stems from lessons learned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> where local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> have had phenomenal success with concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soapsuds</ENAMEX> .
     It also marks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's growing concern that its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao Corp.</ENAMEX> , may bring their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">superconcentrates</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .

     `` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watcher</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's new powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> -- to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer with Color Guard</ENAMEX> -- will be on shelves in that market by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early November</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> confirmed that shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last month</TIMEX> .
     She said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will study results from this market before expanding to others .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Superconcentrates</ENAMEX> are n't entirely new for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G </ENAMEX>.
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> introduced a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lemon Cheer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> after watching the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack</ENAMEX> hit the shelves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> market fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> .
     With the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lemon Cheer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's share is now estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> will be in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> detergent market , where growth is slow and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">liquids</ENAMEX> have gained prominence over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">powders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> may have chosen to market the product under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer</ENAMEX> name since it 's already expanded its best-selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Tide</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> different varieties , including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's big hit , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Tide with Bleach</ENAMEX> .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">superconcentrates</ENAMEX> , however , it is n't always easy to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> that less is more ; many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to dump too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> into the washing machine , believing that it takes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">a cup</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">powder</ENAMEX> to really clean the laundry .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> tried to launch here a concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ariel</ENAMEX> brand name that it markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">product</ENAMEX> , which was n't as concentrated as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer</ENAMEX> , bombed in a market test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> and was dropped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> and others also have tried repeatedly to hook <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fabric softener</ENAMEX> combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> contends the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer</ENAMEX> is a unique formula that also offers an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ingredient</ENAMEX> that prevents colors from fading .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space .
     `` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Zurkuhlen</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Bros .</ENAMEX>
     But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case .
     If the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheer</ENAMEX> sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> follow with their own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">superconcentrates</ENAMEX> .
     Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> `` will probably push the -LCB- less-established -RCB- brands out altogether , '' he says .
     Competition is bound to get tougher if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao</ENAMEX> introduces a product like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Attack</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     To be sure , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao</ENAMEX> would n't have an easy time taking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market share away from the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 23 %</NUMEX> of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> previously have said they are interested in selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergents</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but so far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has focused on acquisitions , such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Andrew Jergens Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">hand-lotion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     It also has a product-testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     Some believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's interest in a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> goes beyond the concern for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is something <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> would do with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zurkuhlen</ENAMEX> .

     With economic tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> worsening , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> had feared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's visit from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trade Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> .
     They expected a new barrage of demands that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to work together and of the importance of the long-term view .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's chief trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator</ENAMEX> had a completely different tone from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's visit by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Mosbacher</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX> called for concrete results by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> in negotiations over fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade .
     He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     But Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">American Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . ''
     She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that we 're moving in earnest . ''
     How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX> and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> .
     Many called it simply a contrast in styles .
     But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic .
     Others said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> may feel the rhetoric on both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides</ENAMEX> is getting out of hand .
     And some said it reflected the growing debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> over pursuing free trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> versus some kind of managed trade .
     Asked to compare her visit to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX> 's , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> . ''
     Yet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> who sat in with her during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> of talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . ''
     `` I think my line has been very consistent , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> said at a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .
     `` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement .
     I do n't feel very ferocious .
     I do n't feel either hard or soft .
     I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . ''
     When she met the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> areas targeted under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Super 301</ENAMEX> provision of the 1988 trade bill .
     She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has identified .
     But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition .
     She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets .
     At her news conference for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> economics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> summed up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> sense of relief .
     `` My impression was that you would be a scary old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> , '' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> .
     `` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of integrity . ''
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , about what exactly her stance is on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> semiconductor market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> market has been stuck around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have interpreted a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> agreement as assuring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> share by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have denied making any such promise .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of her news conferences , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> said , `` I believe we can do much better than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> . ''
     But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade .
     I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market .
