     Including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's plunge , that has given the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> paper losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.5 million</NUMEX> , based on what they would have realized had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and management-led buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> gone through at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX> a share .
     When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , so did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> resurrect a financing package at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> a share , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> would still get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million</NUMEX> less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares and has options to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 250,000</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 83.3125</NUMEX> each .
     In the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share buyout , that totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 76.7 million</NUMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's close of trading , it was good for a paltry <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43.5 million</NUMEX> .

     His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> salary was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 575,000</NUMEX> , with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 575,000</NUMEX> bonus .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">40-year old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> has n't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> paid him a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 375,000</NUMEX> bonus to lure him away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , and he was paid a salary of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 342,122</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 280,000</NUMEX> bonus .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares and has options to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 150,000</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 69</NUMEX> each .
     That came to a combined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37.7 million</NUMEX> under the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share buy-out , but <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 21.3 million</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's close .
     Of the combined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 114.4 million</NUMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were scheduled to reap under the buy-out , they agreed to invest in the buy-out just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> , angering many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> voted themselves , and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> , lifetime access to the Friendly Skies -- free <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-class travel , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> a year for life as well .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuben Mark </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> , said he is `` comfortable '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' estimates that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 95 cents and $ 1.05</NUMEX> a share .
     That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">69 cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year earlier</TIMEX> ; including discontinued operations , per-share was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">88 cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's net income , increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 69.5 million and $ 76 million</NUMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47.1 million</NUMEX> the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-before</TIMEX> period .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's world-wide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.29 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful '' increase in operating profit by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> said .
     Operating profit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> household products and personal-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> added .
     He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and focusing more carefully the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's promotional activities .
     The estimated improvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations took some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> by surprise .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's household products business , which includes such brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Fab</ENAMEX> laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Ajax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cleanser</ENAMEX> , has been a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's sales of household products in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> were flat for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , and they estimated operating margins at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 % to 3 %</NUMEX> .
     `` If you could say their business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was mediocre , but great everywhere else , that would be fine , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonita Austin</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` But it 's not mediocre , it 's a real problem . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> conceded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's domestic business , apart from its highly profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hill 's Pet Products</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , has lagged .
     `` We 've done a lot to improve -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- results , and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> said .
     `` Improving profitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations is an extremely high priority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''
     To focus on its global consumer-products business , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> sold its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kendall</ENAMEX> health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few days</TIMEX> at least , he says , no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns .
     Trouble was , nobody thought they looked right .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Globe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Barnicle</ENAMEX> -- in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> attack on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as many weeks</TIMEX> -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad , it looked `` like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">elixir</ENAMEX> that promises to do away with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> in our lifetime . ''

     Deeply ingrained in both the book review `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Kissing Nature Good-bye</ENAMEX> '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen MacDonald</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leisure & Arts</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 27</TIMEX> -RRB- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity .
     Is such a view justified ? In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> , would the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> enjoy a constant climate over the long term ?
     Clearly not .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">About 20,000 years ago</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last ice age</TIMEX> ended .
     Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> , northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> .
     This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter-gatherers</ENAMEX> hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mammoths</ENAMEX> and scratching around in caves .
     Furthermore , no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming .
     It is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present-day global warming .
     I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage , but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-consumers-global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> plans to restructure itself more like a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , the tax-collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new high-level positions to guide the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">120,000</NUMEX>-employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> : a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> to oversee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> finances and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief information officer</ENAMEX> to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> also said that it would create the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , who will be hired from within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred T. Goldberg</ENAMEX> said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , which has an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5 billion</NUMEX> and collects <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 trillion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> .
     `` My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> said .
     `` And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> properly . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg </ENAMEX>, who took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack of coordination among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branches</ENAMEX> of the vast federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> operates on a computer system designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1961</TIMEX> , which it has been trying to modernize for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , which operated throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 360 million</NUMEX> budget shortfall , has been under a hiring freeze since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last fall</TIMEX> .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> says that closer scrutiny of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue .
     `` I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> hopes to fill the new positions soon .
     Customarily , it would appoint career civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> from within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> said he plans to `` scour the world '' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief information officer</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> .
     Although the jobs will probably pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000</NUMEX> a year , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are confident that they can attract top-notch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from the private sector .
     `` You 're telling someone they can spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three or four or five or six years</TIMEX> of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> said .
     `` On the comptroller side , you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> budget .

     They were the signature of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Antonio Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     The rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> 's slow and painful death , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Battalion-2000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">squad</ENAMEX> , was personally supervised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with access to intelligence reports .
     Leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has put to death <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 70</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> involved in the coup , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">crematoriums</ENAMEX> and funeral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">parlors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Panama City</ENAMEX> .
     He is now changing the place he sleeps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> , sometimes more than once a night .
     His meals are most often prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> he trusts -- his full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicky Amado</ENAMEX> , and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma</ENAMEX> .
     And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coup-makers</ENAMEX> to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> .
     More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> to be dealt with .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the two weeks</TIMEX> since the rebellion , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> hesitantly backed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in maintaining power .
     Yet , while the failed coup is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> that stretches back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three decades</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's war on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> , following his indictment on drug charges in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1988</TIMEX> , is the legacy of that relationship .
     Before <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> foreign policy set out to destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , it helped create him out of the crucible of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's long history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conspirators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> .
     For most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 30 years</TIMEX> , the marriage was one of convenience .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> , for example , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was both a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadet</ENAMEX> at an elite military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Peru</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy-in-training</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> , he was detained by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lima</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for allegedly raping and savagely beating a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX> , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> cable from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that period</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> had nearly died .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> , merely filed the report away .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's tips on emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leftists</ENAMEX> at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> were deemed more important to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests .
     From that point on , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> would make a practice of overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> 's misadventures .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has befriended and later turned against many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictators</ENAMEX> , but none quite so resourceful .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> is n't as smooth as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> , as well-born as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anastasio Somoza</ENAMEX> , as imperial as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> or as bloody as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Haiti</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby Doc Duvalier</ENAMEX> .
     Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them .
     And out of necessity : The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> underestimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> all along , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambler Moss</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     `` He has mastered the art of survival . ''
     In keeping with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's long history of propping up Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , recent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> actions have extended rather than shortened his survival .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> might have fallen of his own weight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> because of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's dire economic situation , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moss</ENAMEX> , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scapegoat</ENAMEX> for his own mismanagement .
     `` If the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moss</ENAMEX> contends .
     Perhaps most important , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> maintain his grip of the throne .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> , upon hearing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was negotiating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name .
     `` He is cornered , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Guardia</ENAMEX> , who has led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> opposition against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have left him without a way out .
     It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . ''
     His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ways and weaknesses .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> often tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that patience is the best weapon against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gringos</ENAMEX> , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> discovered the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Noriega</ENAMEX> in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1959</TIMEX> , when he was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his second year</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Chorrillos Military Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lima</ENAMEX> , according to former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     The contact occurred through Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">half-brother</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Peru</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Carlos</ENAMEX> , knowing that helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> could advance the career of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> , relayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and , more important , among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> was born .
     It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , who was known to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cara la Pina</ENAMEX> -- pineapple face .
     Born the illegitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> , he was raised on the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> of the central market district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Panama City</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> older than most of his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadets</ENAMEX> , and gained admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">academy</ENAMEX> because his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> had falsified his birth certificate .
     He considered himself intellectually superior to his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> , many of whom were wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> sent by their well-off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to the highly disciplined , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-modeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">academy</ENAMEX> as a sort of reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-made uniform , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> from the period say .
     `` He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> where there was a cult of militarism , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were the elite with special privileges , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darien Ayala</ENAMEX> , a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Peru</ENAMEX> and a lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's relationship to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> became contractual in either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1966</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> , intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say .
     His commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Chiriqui Province</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garrison</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Torrijos</ENAMEX> , gave him an intriguing assignment : Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> would organize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> 's first intelligence service .
     The spy network would serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">clients</ENAMEX> : the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , by monitoring political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> in the region , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , by tracking the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> influence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> organized at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Fruit Co.</ENAMEX> 's banana <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plantations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bocas del Toros</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Puerto Armuelles</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Fruit</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's national income .
     Satisfying its interests was a priority for any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's initial retainer was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 50 to $ 100</NUMEX> a month , plus occasional gifts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">liquor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">groceries</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">PX</ENAMEX> , a former intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> says .
     It was modest pay by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> remember as having been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 to $ 400</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> .
     `` He did it very well , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Martinez</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX> who managed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and his operation .
     `` He started building the files that helped him gain power . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Guard</ENAMEX> job assumed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Capt.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1964</TIMEX> -- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the transit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">police</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">David City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Chiriqui Province</ENAMEX> -- was tailor-made for an aspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-spy</ENAMEX> .
     By pressuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">taxi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
     He knew which local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">luminaries</ENAMEX> had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistresses</ENAMEX> .
     This proved particularly valuable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> , when union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were planning a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May Day</TIMEX> march that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> feared could turn violent .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had learned that a local union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> was sleeping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> .
     So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Puerto Armuelles</ENAMEX> , which was ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Fruit Co .</ENAMEX>
     The campaign so divided union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> found them far easier to control .
     `` It was like a play on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Broadway</ENAMEX> , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinez</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> managed the whole thing .
     He was superb .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at bribing and blackmailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Chiriqui</ENAMEX> , however , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> also revealed himself as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> as perverse as he was ingenious .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo Miranda</ENAMEX> , a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> and human-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> , recalls an intoxicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cells</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">5th Zone Garrison</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">David</ENAMEX> , where he had his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">courtyard</ENAMEX> naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda</ENAMEX> recalls .
     But through this period , so far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> military was concerned , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was a model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruit</ENAMEX> .
     He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Fort Gulick</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1967</TIMEX> , according to a copy of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> resume with details Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has since classified as secret .
     He flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Bragg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September of that year</TIMEX> for a course in psychological operations , returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">School of the Americas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a two-month</TIMEX> course called `` military intelligence for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely .
     He rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of intelligence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's socalled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">G-2</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> after providing populist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     He became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> 's inseparable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's secrets .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , by now a lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX> , expanded his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> to include the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> -- not to mention the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> and any other intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">service</ENAMEX> that came knocking .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> complained to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's moonlighting , intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> always insisted that his allegiance was first to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> .
     `` Early on in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> , we took to calling him the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rent-a-colonel</ENAMEX> , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> , '' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis J. McNeil</ENAMEX> , who , as deputy assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of state for inter-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> .
     `` Some of us wondered how our intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> . ''
     Even at this early stage , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> caused additional concerns .
     During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> became dismayed at the extent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">G-2</ENAMEX> 's connections to arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traffickers</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DEA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> drew up a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> options for dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which was assassination .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DEA</ENAMEX> at the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ingersoll</ENAMEX> , scotched the assassination plan .
     But he did fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> to scold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> on the drug ties of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> later recalled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     `` Everybody was afraid of him , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> became an even greater threat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeants</ENAMEX> working for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">470th Military Intelligence Group</ENAMEX> .
     The tapes included wiretaps of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> 's own phone , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     `` We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , '' says former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stansfield Turner</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first time</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> considered cutting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> says .
     `` In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> .
     The question is how much you get tied in with seedy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> so they can extort you . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to this day worry whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> sold sensitive information on the recordings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> or others .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> was troubled enough to cancel the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rent-a-colonel</ENAMEX> at the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> soon found new cause for concern : <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">gun</ENAMEX>-running .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southern Florida</ENAMEX> indicted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanians</ENAMEX> on charges of illegally running <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> trying to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Somoza</ENAMEX> .
     They included one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Wittgreen</ENAMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> were quickly closing in on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> himself .
     At the time , though , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was once again flirting with its longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> made plans to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> for a meeting with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Dade County</ENAMEX> and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> , learning that he intended to fly through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> , made plans to arrest him on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">gun</ENAMEX>-running charges as soon as he hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> soil .
     It was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> foiled the plan .
     According to military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> at the time , word was passed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> by his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> would be waiting .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> received a routine , unclassified message from the military group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     `` Due to health reasons , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lt. Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> has elected to postpone his visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , '' it read .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> received yet another setback .
     Their original indictment against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wittgreen</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX> was dismissed on a technicality .
     But now , along with reindicting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pal</ENAMEX> , they intended to charge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 2 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> , he was told , had granted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> asylum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> as a favor to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> was told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wittgreen</ENAMEX> , would be handling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shah</ENAMEX> 's security .
     It would n't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> was told .
     After prodding from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Eskenazi</ENAMEX> pleaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> to let the indictment proceed .
     `` Unfortunately , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskenazi</ENAMEX> wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . ''
     The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> before the case died a quiet death .
     `` I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> says .
     `` If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1983</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> and de-facto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , having maneuvered his way to the top <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only two years</TIMEX> after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Torrijos</ENAMEX> .
     Soon , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> became a veritable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">mafia</ENAMEX> controlling legal and illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> also put Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">G-2</ENAMEX> back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> payroll .
     Payments averaged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 200,000</NUMEX> a year from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA </ENAMEX>.
     Although working for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was hardly helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> exclusively .
     During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> he expanded his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> and intelligence contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> .
     He allegedly entered into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's first formal business arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd Carlton</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> who once worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and who testified before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> that would ultimately indict the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> on drug charges .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> would n't act against him , recalls his close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Blandon</ENAMEX> , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandon</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Contras</ENAMEX> to set up a secret training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> also conveyed intelligence from his spy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">operation</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Managua</ENAMEX> .
     And on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> occasion , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring of 1985</TIMEX> , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">arsenal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
     Although , his help for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> cause was limited , it was enough to win him important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protectors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Leahy </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> who then served on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> played <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> like a violin , '' he says .
     An incident in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> suggested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional means by which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> might have maintained such influence with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> -- by compromising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtin Windsor</ENAMEX> , then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , recalls being invited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Carlos</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Aswara Peninsula</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> notified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett E. Briggs </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , of the invitation .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> screamed , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> recalls .
     He says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> told him he was being set up for a `` honey trap , '' in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event `` with sound and video . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> , on vacation after resigning his position at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Council</ENAMEX> , could n't be reached for comment .
     As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     For instance , he helped steal the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> elections for the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just one month later</TIMEX> , he also contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , according to documents released for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> 's criminal trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C .</ENAMEX>
     Yet , his political setbacks mounted .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was accused of ordering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> the beheading of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Spadafora</ENAMEX> , his most outspoken political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to publicly finger Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> on drug trafficking charges .
     He then ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Ardito Barletta</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">World Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with close ties to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barletta</ENAMEX> tried to create a commission to investigate the murder .
     And , all the while , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's debt problems continued to grow .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was growing desperate .
     In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , he made an offer he thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> could n't refuse .
     As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> trial , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> offered to assassinate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in exchange `` for a promise to help clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's image and a commitment to lift the -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- ban on military sales to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Panamanian Defense Forces</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> , '' the document went on , referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> , `` has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> law forbade such actions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> responded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had numerous assets in place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> and could accomplish many essential things , just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had helped -LCB- the U.S. . -RCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> in blowing up a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">arsenal</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> conveyed the request to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Abrams</ENAMEX> , who relayed it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Shultz</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's proposal was turned down .
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shultz</ENAMEX> curtly told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrams</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image .
     The end of the marriage was at hand .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weeks</TIMEX> the unfolding <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> scandal took away Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's insurance policy .
     The death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX> and resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> allowed anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to gain influence .
     Public protests against him were triggered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1987</TIMEX> due to charges by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz Herrera</ENAMEX> , his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> had stolen the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spadafora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrijos</ENAMEX> .
     Few <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were willing any longer to defend him .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1988</TIMEX> .
     During negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1988</TIMEX> over proposals to drop the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> indictments in exchange for his resignation , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> often asked almost plaintively how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> , whom he had helped for so many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> , could turn against him .
     Now , neither side -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> -- has an easy out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has sworn to bring him to justice .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> believes he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power .
     It is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death .
     In the end , is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> the political equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> , created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power ?
     Not quite , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leahy</ENAMEX> contends .
     `` For short-term gains , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were willing to put up with him .
     That allowed him to get stronger and stronger , '' he says .
     `` I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him , nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong .

     Industrial production declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> said output of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> expanded at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , substantially slower than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` Capital spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dederick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northern Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates .

     The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods , those intended to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than three years</TIMEX> .
     The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> , a category that includes the steel industry .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> report compares mortality rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">between the ages of 35 and 44</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> apart .
     The death rate from lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">35 to 44</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.4</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> , but the mortality rate of the same age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.6</NUMEX> , a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.7 %</NUMEX> .
     Measured the same way , the decline for black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.2 %</NUMEX> .
     The drop in mortality rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was less steep -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.9 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .
     The study , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Devesa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Blot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Fraumeni</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , also shows that the incidence of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> as well as the death rate declined over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">35-44</TIMEX> age bracket , except black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung-cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rates are increasing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> as a whole , the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lung-cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55</TIMEX> , with sharp increases for everybody but white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraumeni</ENAMEX> , one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the report , said `` the declining rates we 're seeing for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future . ''
     However , he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking .
     `` Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> , they ca n't be taken for granted , '' the report says .
     `` Smoking prevention programs should reach larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> . ''
     An editorial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCI Journal</ENAMEX> says the report of declining <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung-cancer</ENAMEX> mortality `` among young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> where the tobacco industry spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 2 billion</NUMEX> a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking . ''
     But the editorial , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Stjernsward</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> , notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">tobacco</ENAMEX> consumption and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung-cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rates are rising in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     `` Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education .
     Asked for comment , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker Merryman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Tobacco Institute</ENAMEX> , said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> could violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> protection of free speech .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX> , smoking is responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung-cancer</ENAMEX> cases among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCI</ENAMEX> report attributes the differences in mortality rates by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> to different smoking patterns .
     A higher proportion of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> smoke than white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> .
     While nearly equal percentages of black and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> currently smoke , in both sexes more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> have given up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> .
     In comparing changes in mortality rates over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCI</ENAMEX> study looked only at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">native Americans</ENAMEX> were n't studied ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> were included with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> trying to profit from the recent volatility in financial markets invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market , prompting even more swings in stock prices .
     After gaining strength during a brief run-up when trading began , the Nasdaq Composite Index weakened under selling pressure .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> at work included computer-guided trading , as well as profit-driven market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> and institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who had bought stock on the cheap during the recent correction .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last two hours</TIMEX> of trading , the composite almost drew even on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> before slipping again .
     The Nasdaq Composite closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.05</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">459.93</NUMEX> .
     The action was confined to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's biggest and most liquid stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     The Nasdaq 100 Index began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">449.89</NUMEX> , lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , and was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> at another .
     The barometer of the biggest nonfinancial stocks settled at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">448.49</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.40</NUMEX> .
     Its counterpart , the Nasdaq Financial Index , was weak for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , sliding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.51</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">453.57</NUMEX> by the end of trading .
     The volatility was dizzying for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     `` The market must have turned up and down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> different times , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Zipper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> .

     Certainly conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> can defend their limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet</ENAMEX> , '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Brooks</ENAMEX> , editorial page , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 5</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Old Environmentalism involved microbe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sanitationists</ENAMEX> .
     It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soap</ENAMEX> and washable underwear during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX> .
     Then cast-iron sewer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pipe</ENAMEX> and the flush toilet were followed by sewage - and water-treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX> .
     Medicine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> was dedicated mostly to combating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and diagnostic analysis .
     Then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> saw the evolution of private-sector wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , which promulgated medical therapy .
     The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy , eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being .
     Most public-health measures were handled at the local level .
     New Environmentalism probably started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1962</TIMEX> with the publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachel Carson</ENAMEX> 's book `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Silent Spring</ENAMEX> . ''
     Shortly thereafter , hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened , uninhabitable planet possibly by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> .
     These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalwarts</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Ehrlich </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Commoner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Dubois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wald</ENAMEX> .
     Writing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> suggested that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> could be eliminated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wald</ENAMEX> suggested that life on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">earth</ENAMEX> might end by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehrlich</ENAMEX> predicted unprecedented famine by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     There were many more .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">products</ENAMEX> were categorized as carcinogenic , with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> .
     Unknown before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> were the inconclusive effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">acid rain</ENAMEX> , greenhouse warming and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ozone</ENAMEX> depletion , all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">New Environmentalists</ENAMEX> systematically opposed the methods of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Environmentalists</ENAMEX> .
     Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">New Environmentalists</ENAMEX> oppose private wealth creation -LRB- which , they claim , depletes natural resources -RRB- and nuclear power -LRB- even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect -RRB- .
     They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">New Environmentalism</ENAMEX> is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power .
     Let 's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore .

     Your story missed some essential points of the conference on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Global Environment : Are We Overreacting ?</ENAMEX> ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and foremost , the vignettes presented by the various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> represent a general consensus among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> working in the respective aspects of the global environment .
     Consider , for example , the greenhouse effect and climate change ; numerous blue-ribbon scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committees</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Academy of Science</ENAMEX> , judge there is a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50 %</NUMEX> probability of a grave problem in the offing .
     The point was to answer the question in the conference title , not to try to create news stories for the event itself .
     Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions , although various points were raised .
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> was asked to address a specific topic , not deliver a point of view .
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> independently concluded society and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change .
     This leads to a very special sense of urgency .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues , that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism .
     The environment can no longer be a normal issue , to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change .
     We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere .
     This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems .
     The problems of the environment are so interrelated , so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">less than 10 years</TIMEX> .
     The consensus from the scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes .
     No , we are not overreacting .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> , fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</NUMEX> on flat revenue .
     Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth , the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coke</ENAMEX> bottling operation said net fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The results met estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , who had already slashed their projections after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> that its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> earnings could tumble <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 37 %</NUMEX> .
     A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises</ENAMEX> sticks by its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> forecast .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> revenue was flat at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> results , however , included the operations of a bottling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , which was sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December</TIMEX> .
     Excluding that bottling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises</ENAMEX> ' volume , measured by cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soda</ENAMEX> , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 %</NUMEX> .
     The volume is well below the industry 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % to 5 %</NUMEX> growth rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , but in line with other soft-drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> volume also compares with a very strong <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises</ENAMEX> blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices , which were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3 %</NUMEX> higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> have been accustomed to buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soft-drinks</ENAMEX> at discounted prices for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises</ENAMEX> said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it expects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> will adjust to higher-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soft drinks</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> attributed the bulk of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> increase in selling , administrative and general expenses -- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 324.9 million</NUMEX> -- to marketing costs .
     `` They 're out there promoting like crazy , trying to get prices up by promotion , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Burry</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co .</ENAMEX>
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises </ENAMEX>' net fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">63 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue was flat at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.97 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises</ENAMEX> , which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> , also said it repurchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1.2 million</NUMEX> of its common shares during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     The buy-back is part of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-million</NUMEX>-share repurchase plan , under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Enterprises</ENAMEX> so far has acquired a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Purchase</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> , as expected , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal third-quarter</TIMEX> net rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 269.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 241.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">91 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.90 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.13 billion</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The year-ago quarter</TIMEX> 's results include an after-tax charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> from the sale of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">winery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> , filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> bankruptcy protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> has a working relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> .
     It is providing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> in emergency financing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and has agreed to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 75 million</NUMEX> in receivables from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.

     At the time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> in operation .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed , causing jitters among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems .
