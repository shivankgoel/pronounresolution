     The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     Major oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days</TIMEX> are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter a year ago</TIMEX> , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability .
     The gasoline picture may improve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this quarter</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> are likely to remain weak , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , reducing chances that profits could equal their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> performance .
     The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Cox</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> , said in an interview .
     `` That change will obviously impact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third and fourth quarter</TIMEX> earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .
     He did n't forecast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> 's results .
     But securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> will be among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings .
     So , too , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> predict , will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Typical is what happened to the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene</ENAMEX> , a major commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> produced in vast amounts by many oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     It has plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 26 cents</NUMEX> a pound .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> ethylene sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33 cents</NUMEX> , peaking at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 34 cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December</TIMEX> .
     A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion .
     Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1987</TIMEX> , prices began accelerating as a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy and the weak dollar spurred demand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> added capacity furiously .
     Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower .
     Third-quarter profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> were weaker .
     `` Refining margins were so good in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of last year</TIMEX> and generally not very good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randol</ENAMEX> , a securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Oil company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries</ENAMEX> ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> that did n't materialize .
     The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period .
     In addition , crude oil prices were up some from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , further pressuring profitability .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Refiners</ENAMEX> say margins picked up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , and many industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> believe gasoline profits will rebound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this quarter</TIMEX> , though still not to the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 's fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 second half</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> posted record gasoline and chemical profits .
     Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Prices -- averaging roughly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> a barrel higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> -- have stayed well above most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' expectations .
     Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` We could see higher oil prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Jacoboski</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc .</ENAMEX>
     That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> when oil prices steadily fell to below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13</NUMEX> a barrel in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , they averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> less than they were in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     The main reason remains weather .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer</TIMEX> was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> to burn more natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This summer</TIMEX> , on the other hand , had milder weather than usual .
     `` We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     `` The lagging gas price is not going to assist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth quarter</TIMEX> performance as many had expected . ''
     Going into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> , natural gas prices are anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % to 17 %</NUMEX> lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     For instance , natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> currently produced along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Gulf Coast</ENAMEX> is selling on the spot market for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1.47</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">thousand cubic feet</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.69</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">thousand cubic feet</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , trying to blunt growing demands from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> for a relaxation of controls on exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">bloc</ENAMEX> , is questioning whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ing . C. Olivetti &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> supplied militarily valuable technology to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
     Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Western European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls</ENAMEX> , the unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">forum</ENAMEX> through which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 25</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">26</TIMEX> .
     They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> says it wants to see evidence that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization .
     To make its point , it is challenging the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to explain reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> may have supplied the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Sunday Times</ENAMEX> , which first reported the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> concerns , cited a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence report as the source of the allegations that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> exported <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> in `` embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> aviation industry . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> reportedly began shipping these tools in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> acknowledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is discussing the allegations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> government and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> , but declined to confirm any details .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesco Cossiga</ENAMEX> promised a quick investigation into whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> broke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> rules .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> called his attention to the matter during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> 's visit here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> has denied that it violated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> .
     Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> .
     `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> meeting , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> for a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ENAMEX> meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> embargo of strategic goods .
     But more recently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> openly feuded over the extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cocom</ENAMEX> should liberalize exports of personal computers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">bloc</ENAMEX> .
     However , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization .
     `` There 's no evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> program to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers International Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> , announced it will issue warrants on shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     The move closely follows a similar offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> of warrants for shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Under the latest offer , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 62.5 million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 8 million</NUMEX> -RRB- of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> warrants will be issued in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , each giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> the right to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong Telecommunications</ENAMEX> share at a price to be determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 million</NUMEX> warrants will be priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 1.25</NUMEX> each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 26 %</NUMEX> .
     In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the shares closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 4.80</NUMEX> each .
     At this price , the shares would have to rise above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$ 6.05</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> 's issue to profitably convert their warrants .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> 's warrants are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> here to be issued by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bankers</ENAMEX> said warrants for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> stocks are attractive because they give foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , wary of volatility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong Telecommunications</ENAMEX> warrants should be attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> added , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> market that has international appeal .

     In a suit filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> declined in value .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> negotiated an agreement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Vagabond Hotels</ENAMEX> to purchase a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Vagabond Hotels</ENAMEX> was controlled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations .

     However , the agreement was canceled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1984</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> purchased the bonds in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 70</NUMEX> different transactions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> and since then has realized <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> in losses on them , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .

     While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , wheat prices remain stubbornly high .
     And they 're likely to stay that way for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> to come , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , even with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> planting more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Plains</ENAMEX> ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .
     Also supporting prices are expectations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> will place substantial buying orders over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months</TIMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next May 31</TIMEX> , stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> to be carried over into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next season</TIMEX> -- before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">443 million bushels</NUMEX> .
     That would be the lowest level since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> .

     It now estimates production for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">just under 2.6 billion bushels</NUMEX> , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's estimated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.04 billion</NUMEX> and a drought-stunted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.81 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     But the full effect on prices of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> now being planted wo n't be felt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of next year</TIMEX> .
     Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</NUMEX>-a-bushel level , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery settled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.0675</NUMEX> a bushel , unchanged .
     In theory at least , tight supplies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Basse </ENAMEX>, a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AgResource Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CBOT</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A.</ENAMEX> to liquidate futures positions equal to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 23 million bushels</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> said it feared that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would n't be able to find enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .
     Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Plains</ENAMEX> and in wheat-growing areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> is threatening to reduce the yield from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this season</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> wheat <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Leslie</ENAMEX> , a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leslie Analytical</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     For example , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> panhandle , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> or more of the topsoil is short of moisture .
     That figure climbs to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 47 %</NUMEX> in wheat-growing portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> to place sizable orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months</TIMEX> , further supporting prices .
     `` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> demand '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming weeks</TIMEX> , predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Feltes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , research , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refco Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Looking ahead to other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> :
     Orange Juice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> will go .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Thursday</TIMEX> , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> estimate of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989-90</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> .
     It was near the low range of estimates , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130 million</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">90-pound</NUMEX> boxes , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146.6 million</NUMEX> boxes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last season</TIMEX> .
     However , as expected , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.34</NUMEX> a pound from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1.55</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> report might have had and sent the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> orange juice contract down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 6.55 cents</NUMEX> a pound at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time .
     It settled with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.95 cents</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3210</NUMEX> a pound .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">juice</ENAMEX> , after a delay caused by drought at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of its crop season</TIMEX> , is beginning to arrive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in large quantities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply .
     The price cut , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said , appeared to be aimed even more at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , where consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">juice</ENAMEX> has fallen .
     It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> futures prices have dropped significantly from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 2</NUMEX> a pound at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear</TIMEX> .
     Barring a cold snap or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , when harvesting and processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oranges</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> reach their peak , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     Energy
     Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> look for profit-taking in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's leap in crude oil prices , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's rally is generally expected to continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     `` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hinton</ENAMEX> , an energy futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stotler &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> capped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery finished at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.89</NUMEX> a barrel , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42 cents</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> markets , meanwhile , spot prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes</ENAMEX> were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> a barrel .
     `` This market still wants to go higher , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nauman Barakat</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     He predicted that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> contract will reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.50</NUMEX> a barrel or more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes</ENAMEX> .
     There also are recurring reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria</ENAMEX> has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes</ENAMEX> such as those produced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria .</ENAMEX>

     If a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">predator</ENAMEX> emerges for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-founders</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> will lead a management buy-out attempt , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's stock-market sell-off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and turmoil in the junk-bond market .
     But the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> advertising and consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> named a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southeastern Asset Management</ENAMEX> , said it had been approached by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties</ENAMEX> interested in a possible restructuring .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , but was rebuffed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> said he would n't launch a hostile bid .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ENAMEX> said that `` if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bidder</ENAMEX> came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> said any buy-out would be led by the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielvogel</ENAMEX> is n't part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , nor are any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> did n't name any price , but securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> would fetch upward of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> denied speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> was bringing in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> only to clean up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> financially so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> could lead a buy-back .
     That speculation abounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> analyzed the appointment of the new chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis-Dreyfus</ENAMEX> , who joins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> and becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Dreyfus</ENAMEX> , formerly chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of the pharmaceutical research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMS International Inc.</ENAMEX> , has a reputation as a savvy financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , and will be charged largely with repairing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's poor financial state .
     Asked about the speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Dreyfus</ENAMEX> has been hired to pave the way for a buy-out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> has been brought in .
     He was brought in to turn around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''

     Newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers</ENAMEX> are reporting mixed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results , aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage , especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> .
     Adding to unsteadiness in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.

     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">papers</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> are also faced with a slowdown in classified-ad spending , a booming category for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     Until recently , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year 's third and fourth quarters</TIMEX> .
     All bets are off , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , because of the shifting ownership of the retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> .
     `` Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J.

     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailers</ENAMEX> are just in disarray . ''
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett Co.</ENAMEX> posted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an 11 %</NUMEX> gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">non-daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> increase in advertising and circulation revenue .
     Total advertising linage was `` modestly '' lower as classified-ad volume increased , while there was `` softer demand '' for retail and national ad linage , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Curley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , ad pages totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">785</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.2 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> period , which was helped by increased ad spending from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Summer Olympics</ENAMEX> .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's total paid ad pages for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year to date</TIMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,735</NUMEX> , a decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> 's ad revenue increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett </ENAMEX>'s net rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.5 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 270 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.68</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 247 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.52</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.55 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</NUMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.9 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period included a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 404.1 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 383.8 million</NUMEX> .
     The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barron 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Affiliated Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> reversed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier third quarter</TIMEX> net loss .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Globe</ENAMEX> reported net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents</NUMEX> a share , compared with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38 cents</NUMEX> a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter in 1988</TIMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> profit estimates for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint , which in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> has had several price increases .
     After a supply crunch caused prices to rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 650</NUMEX> a metric ton , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atorino</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> said he estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times Mirror Co.</ENAMEX> 's earnings were down for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , because of soft advertising levels at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Long Island Newsday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hartford Courant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     Trouble on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> was likely offset by improved ad linage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> also unveiled a redesign .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times Co.</ENAMEX> is expected to report lower earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and deep discounting of newsprint at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Forest Products Group</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post Co.</ENAMEX> is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> area .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> .
     The news-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">weekly</ENAMEX> has faced heightened competition from rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> and a relatively flat magazine advertising market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knight-Ridder Inc.</ENAMEX> is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Detroit Free Press</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Detroit News</ENAMEX> , and has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> that earnings were down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .

     In announcements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> effectively signed death notices for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> full-sized van assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , and cast serious doubt on the futures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> is under intense pressure to close <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> that became unprofitable as the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market share skidded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> .

     Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason is mounting competition from new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> that are pouring out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> a year at costs lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> can match .

     That means <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> -- one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scarborough</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ontario</ENAMEX> , and the other in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lordstown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> -- probably will be shut down after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1991</TIMEX> .
     The shutdowns will idle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert White</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Canadian Auto Workers</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , used the impending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scarborough</ENAMEX> shutdown to criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> free trade agreement and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> may benefit from a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> move that affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> is studying whether it can build the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Camaro-Firebird</ENAMEX> profitably at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Therese</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> , company and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     That announcement left union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Van Nuys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> uncertain about their futures .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Van Nuys</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , does n't have a product to build after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Shrieves</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW</ENAMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> building the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">eight-year-old</TIMEX> A-body mid-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Featherston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW</ENAMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> will die .
     He said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> has plans to keep building A-body <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac </ENAMEX>, however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Camaro-Firebird</ENAMEX> decision appears to erase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW</ENAMEX> hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> would reopen the shuttered assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac Fiero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> before slow sales of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiero</ENAMEX> forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to close the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have taken a beating politically as a result .
     Dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UAW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Institut Merieux S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught BioSciences Inc.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">942 million Canadian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 801.6 million</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of `` net benefit '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> gave it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 days</TIMEX> in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's action was unusual .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Nymark</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada</ENAMEX> , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> history that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
     `` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodi Redmond</ENAMEX> , press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvie Andre</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of industry , science and technology .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andre</ENAMEX> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Spokesmen</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada</ENAMEX> , but added they hope to have more information <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viren Mehta</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mehta &amp; Isaly</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based pharmaceutical industry research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's ruling was n't unexpected .
     `` This has become a very politicized deal , concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> 's dispute with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University</ENAMEX> is seeking to block the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> is considering a settlement proposal made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> .
     While neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">side</ENAMEX> will disclose its contents , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Investment Canada</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">585,000</NUMEX> shares of its preferred stock outstanding .
     The exchange ratio was never established .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weatherford</ENAMEX> said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .
     The energy-services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said , however , that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1990</TIMEX> , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weatherford</ENAMEX> suspended its preferred-dividend payment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1985</TIMEX> and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6 million</NUMEX> , but will do so some time in the future .
     Additionally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> for the proposed offering of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> shares of common stock , expected to be offered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> .

     Earnings for most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's major pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are believed to have moved ahead briskly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with newer , big-selling prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> fared especially well .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> , however , most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck &amp; Co. </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner-Lambert Co.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Squibb Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ENAMEX> all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicines</ENAMEX> that provide wide profit margins .
     Less robust earnings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn Co.</ENAMEX> were attributed to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicines</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Riccardo</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , said that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> have shed their slow-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with very large revenues , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riccardo</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said profit for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen</NUMEX> or so big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , is estimated to have climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 11 % and 14 %</NUMEX> .
     While that 's not spectacular , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Sweig</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Bache </ENAMEX>, said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> if the economy turns downward .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweig</ENAMEX> estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck </ENAMEX>'s profit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> rose by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 22 %</NUMEX> , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , including its anti-cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Mevacor</ENAMEX> ; a high blood pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Vasotec</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Primaxin</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">antibiotic</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Pepcid</ENAMEX> , an anti-ulcer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medication</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweig</ENAMEX> said he estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> 's earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Prozac</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , is expected to generate sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's lean operation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lopid</ENAMEX> , to power earnings growth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lopid</ENAMEX> sales are expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .

     However , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , having been subjected to news footage of the devastated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">South Bronx</ENAMEX> , look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">borough</ENAMEX> the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman McCoy</ENAMEX> did in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bonfire of the Vanities</ENAMEX> '' -- as a wrong turn into hell .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Cunningham</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx</ENAMEX> , her childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'50s</TIMEX> , is something else altogether .
     In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Sleeping Arrangements</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knopf</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- , she remembers an exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">playground</ENAMEX> , peopled mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX> and the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Catholic</ENAMEX> -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> , the hell-kitten <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> , age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">five</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall .
     She transforms her `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx</ENAMEX> of the emotions , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">place</ENAMEX> where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Babylonian Bronx</ENAMEX> , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Babylonian Bronx</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lived in drab , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> `` glamorized '' with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">AnaMor Towers</ENAMEX> -LRB- after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris Snezak</ENAMEX> -RRB- , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lobbies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hallways</ENAMEX> were decorated with murals of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Syrians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> , friezes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pompeii</ENAMEX> .
     For Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">AnaMor Towers</ENAMEX> as a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> : `` ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . ''
     Sharp-witted and funny but never mean , she 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">memorialist</ENAMEX> a bit like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman Capote</ENAMEX> , if he 'd been <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and less bitchy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Lily</ENAMEX> , as Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary .
     She was raised , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first eight years</TIMEX> , by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> , whom she remembers as a loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liar</ENAMEX> , who realigned history to explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> did n't live with them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> reinvented this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , who may or may not have known about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> , as a war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> 's benefit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> died young and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> has remembered her as a romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> , who did n't interfere much with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 's education on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> .
     The games <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> played -LRB- holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's crack standards , but Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX> makes it all sound like a great adventure .
     `` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes .
     She analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> by their sleeping arrangements .
     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bedroom</ENAMEX> , as though she were a temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> .
     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX> ; they did n't seem to have any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bedrooms</ENAMEX> at all .
     Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> became so obsessed with where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> died , her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements .
     They painted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> orange , pink and white , according to her instructions .
     With loving detail she recalls her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Gabe</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Orthodox Jew</ENAMEX> and song <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyricist</ENAMEX> -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Len</ENAMEX> , a mysterious part-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> who looked like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> on a good-will mission . ''
     They came by their strangeness honestly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> , no cookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX> , excised the heads of disliked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Philosophy for Women</ENAMEX> . ''
     The book loses some momentum toward the end , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily</ENAMEX> becomes more preoccupied with dating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and less with her delightfully weird <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> .
     For the most part , though , there 's much pleasure in her saucy , poignant probe into the mysteries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Babylonian Bronx</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bronx</ENAMEX> also figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Jay Friedman</ENAMEX> 's latest novel , which flashes back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'50s</TIMEX> .
     But both the past and present worlds of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Current Climate</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Monthly Press</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- feel cramped and static .
     For his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> novel , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> work , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">About Harry Towns</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> is now a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> , whose continuing flirtation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and marginal types in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> seems quaintly out-of-synch .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> fondly remembers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the `` old '' days of the early '70s</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis</ENAMEX> would take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX> on a date to analyze what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis</ENAMEX> was doing wrong .
     `` An <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">L.A.</ENAMEX> solution , '' explains Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> .
     Line by line Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> social scheme -- the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> has avoided all that by living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Long Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suburb</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> disappears for drug-seeking forays into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
     But it does n't take too many lines to figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> out .
     He 's a bore .

     The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> office space and housing is also affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's retail real estate market .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill .
     Retail real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">tenants</ENAMEX> are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom .
     `` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith Consolo </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc .</ENAMEX>
     There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> for rent , up from a more typical range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> .
     `` This further confuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> , '' she says .
     `` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ?
     Is this the wrong time to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> ?
     Who is going to be in the space next door ? ''
     In addition , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consolo</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">tenants</ENAMEX> usually can negotiate to pay rents that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-quarter</NUMEX> lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> ' initial asking price .
     A handful of hot retail locations , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">57th Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Madison</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents .
     And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau .
     But on average , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> retail rents have dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 15 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past six months</TIMEX> alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say .
     That follows a more subtle decline in the prior <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> rents had run up rapidly since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing .
     `` As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses</ENAMEX> contract or depart , the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who might use retail services shrinks , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward A. Friedman</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley Spear Inc .</ENAMEX>
     He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market .
     Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     In these locations , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . ''
     Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> .
     It is also no comfort to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> when the future of larger department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B. Altman 's</ENAMEX> , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> is for sale by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> are bemoaning the loss of favorite local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to high rents .
     But , despite the recent softening , for many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> , when their leases were signed .
     Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> comes cheap .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> retail rents still run well above the going rate in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Madison</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">East 57th Street</ENAMEX> can command rents of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 500</NUMEX> a square foot , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> is not uncommon .
     The thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">34th Street</ENAMEX> area offers rents of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100</NUMEX> a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> .
     By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> rarely top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> a square foot .
     And rents on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Rodeo Drive</ENAMEX> generally do n't exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 125</NUMEX> a square foot .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brennan</ENAMEX> marks the start of his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">34th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">83-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> .
     This role reversal holds true , as well , for his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> liberal and moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurgood Marshall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Blackmun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stevens</ENAMEX> .
     But are these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">80s</TIMEX> , ready to assume a different role after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">88 years</TIMEX> , collectively , of service on the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ?
     Every indication is that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> appear philosophical about it ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackmun</ENAMEX> appear fighting mad .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> to dissent , often joining forces in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> to criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's conservative drift .
     But always , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past</TIMEX> , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases .
     Now , however , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-member conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> continues to solidify , victories for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> are rare .
     The change is most dramatic for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> , the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1960s</TIMEX> liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Warren</ENAMEX> .
     In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> terms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967</TIMEX> , the height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court</ENAMEX> 's power , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> cast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 25</NUMEX> dissenting votes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">555</NUMEX> cases decided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last term</TIMEX> alone he cast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> dissenting votes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> decisions , with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> speech .
     `` Each time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> revisits an issue , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he said .
     Moreover , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> he has said that when he was on the winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> , he knew that the tables might turn in the future .
     He has said that he now knows how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Harlan</ENAMEX> felt , a reference to the late conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> who was the most frequent dissenter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court</ENAMEX> 's opinions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associates</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">81-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> say he was `` depressed '' about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's direction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's cutbacks in civil rights .
     `` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     He , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> , considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tribe</ENAMEX> says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court</ENAMEX> , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's direction might change soon .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackmun</ENAMEX> , who will turn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">81</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , also seems feisty about his new role .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associates</ENAMEX> say he takes some defeats more personally than his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recognized in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> opinion , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade </ENAMEX>.
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> who saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackmun</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> said he was no more discouraged about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King </ENAMEX>'s famous ``<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER"> I Have a Dream</ENAMEX> '' speech from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">March on Washington</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">69</TIMEX> , is probably the most philosophical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters</ENAMEX> about his role , in part because he may be the least <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> more than the others .
     If the role these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters</ENAMEX> are assuming is a familiar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> say .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Court</ENAMEX> were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.E.

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> bought another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> , in the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> transaction with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     Under these deals , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> sells just the deposits and the healthy assets .
     These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , to be sold later .
     In these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> , for instance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> is stuck with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.51 billion</NUMEX> in bad assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Acquirers</ENAMEX> paid premiums ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 % to 3.7 %</NUMEX> for the deposits and branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">systems</ENAMEX> , roughly in line with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were expecting .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers</ENAMEX> will also be locked into deposit rates for just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> , as has been the case with previous deals .
     After that , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers</ENAMEX> may repudiate the rates paid by the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     But it 's uncertain whether these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> will take those steps .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> , for example , has been one of the highest rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">payers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> market , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> had previously targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> .
     `` These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> are beached <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Ely</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Alexandria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va .</ENAMEX>
     For example , the delay in selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">People 's Heritage Savings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salina</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan.</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> in assets , has forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> to consider selling off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX>-by-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> , instead of as a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> continued its foray into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">University Federal Savings Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> , which had assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Texas National Bank</ENAMEX> will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> a premium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 129 million</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 billion</NUMEX> in deposits .
     As a measure of the depths to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> real estate market has sunk , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 billion</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> to take <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> of bad assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> also acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freedom Savings &amp; Loan Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , which had total assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> a premium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40.4 million</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> in deposits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> will also acquire <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 266 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freedom</ENAMEX> 's assets from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> , which will require <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 875 million</NUMEX> in assistance .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> will pay a premium of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30.5 million</NUMEX> to assume <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> in deposits .
     It will also purchase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 845 million</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's assets , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> assistance .
     In the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> transaction with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Trustco Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX> , will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Savings Bank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , which had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 949 million</NUMEX> in assets .
