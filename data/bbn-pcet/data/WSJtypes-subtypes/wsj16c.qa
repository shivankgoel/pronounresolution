     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> expect a wide divergence in performance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Stores</ENAMEX> in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to stable chains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Limited Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">May Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> , which should do well .

     The result has been a dangerous vacuum of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> leadership , which leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> open to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> adventurism .
     `` The -LCB- influence of the -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is not being felt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's decisions do not respond to a policy , and are divorced from reality , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Volio</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> .
     The disarray of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> diplomacy was evident in the failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of American States</ENAMEX> to condemn categorically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     Faced with this embarrassment , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> expressed confidence that the influential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Rio Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> , which gathered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Peru</ENAMEX> , would take a stronger posture toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> .
     But other than a few slaps on the wrist , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> went unpunished by that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">body</ENAMEX> , too ; he was not even singled out in the closing statement .
     Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> and encounter <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strongman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> , eager for photo opportunities with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Arias</ENAMEX> , did not invite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Chile</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> or Haiti to the summit , which was to be restricted to democracies .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> was included .
     Formally upgrading the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> .
     Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Manuel Castillo</ENAMEX> -- the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">National Liberation Party</ENAMEX> -- made public his opposition to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> `` in a democratic festivity . ''
     Nevertheless , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> agreed to the dubious arrangement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few weeks</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> met in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tela</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Honduras</ENAMEX> , to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> hoped that by pleasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX> , it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> until after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> 's promises of democratic elections were tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next February</TIMEX> .
     However , relying on an ardent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> movement for help in delaying the disarming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> was risky business .
     And even some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last-minute</TIMEX> phone calls that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made -LRB- at the behest of some conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> -RRB- to enlist backing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> position failed to stop the march of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX> 's agenda .
     Prior to this episode , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Dodd </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , sensing an open field , undertook a personal diplomatic mission through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> to promote an early disbanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> .
     Visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> , he praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> for their electoral system and chided the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> for not rewarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Honduras</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> are a hot political issue , he promised to help unblock some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</NUMEX> in assistance withheld due to the failure of local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> to comply with conditions agreed upon with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     Aid was also the gist of the talks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX> had with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Salvadoran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfredo Cristiani</ENAMEX> ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristiani</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is very much at the mercy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> largess and is forced to listen very carefully to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX> 's likes and dislikes .
     It was therefore not surprising that close <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , virtually neglected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insurgents</ENAMEX> dismantled by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> , long before the elections .
     Fittingly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tela Accords</ENAMEX> were nicknamed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hondurans</ENAMEX> `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX> plan . ''
     The individual foreign policy carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> adds to a confusing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> performance that has emboldened <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> initiatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 3</TIMEX> , following conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Managua</ENAMEX> to acclaim `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's great peace efforts . ''
     There , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan : The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> election if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> did likewise with its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> .
     He also called on Nicaragua 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">neighbors</ENAMEX> to accept a `` military equilibrium '' guaranteed by both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">superpowers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> claims that in spite of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's words , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> continue to flow into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> at near-record levels .
     Since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze </ENAMEX>'s proposals followed discussions with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , speculations arose that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> was seeking an accommodation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> .
     This scheme would fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Arias Plan</ENAMEX> , which declared a false symmetry between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> military aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">dictatorship</ENAMEX> and that provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> to freely elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> .
     Furthermore , it is also likely to encourage those on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> asking for cuts in the assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">El Salvador</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristiani</ENAMEX> does not bend to demands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> .
     The sad condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> is best depicted by the recent end to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> sponsorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> requested help to establish a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">station</ENAMEX> in the northern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , flooded by airwaves of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> propaganda .
     Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and affiliated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice of America</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VOA</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few months ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> decided to stop this cooperation , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> operating on a shoestring .
     According to news reports , the abrupt termination was due to fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VOA</ENAMEX> transmissions could interfere with the peace process .
     In the meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Russia</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> another powerful radio transmitter , which has been installed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Esteli</ENAMEX> .
     It is capable of reaching the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Caribbean</ENAMEX> area and deep into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">condominium</ENAMEX> being created in the isthmus thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> default .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> entrenchment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is alarming for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , a peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">democracy</ENAMEX> without an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> .
     Questioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX> voiced expectations of direct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> action .
     A poll conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Costa Ricans</ENAMEX> believe that if their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> is militarily attacked by either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> will come to its defense .
     But in the light of events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has such clear strategic interests , waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Delta Force</ENAMEX> may prove to be a dangerous gambit .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pitney Bowes Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> authorized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wheeler Group Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , a direct mail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketer</ENAMEX> of office supplies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pitney Bowes</ENAMEX> said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wheeler Group</ENAMEX> 's marketing business with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pitney Bowes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> would n't comment on whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had talked with any potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Hartford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , which had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 75 million</NUMEX> .
     She said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wheeler Group</ENAMEX> was profitable but would n't give figures .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't have a timetable for the sale , adding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision just starts the search for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> .

     Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">1.5-mile</NUMEX> stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> familiar with the project say .
     The test project -- which reportedly survived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> with the steel casings .
     State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadbed</ENAMEX> , that was responsible for the collapse .
     The failure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> of the freeway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">segment</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were hopeful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> initially feared .
     Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several days</TIMEX> .
     Red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tractors</ENAMEX> gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete .
     Giant yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cranes</ENAMEX> were wheeled up alongside the collapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">segment</ENAMEX> , preparing to lift off chunks of the debris .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , a transportation department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
     However , he asserted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> noted , snafus in transportation funding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has experienced over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting , even if it were technologically feasible .
     Knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said the retrofitting , which had n't yet been budgeted , was part of a planned , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stage reinforcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> begun by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> reinforcement project itself was part of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> effort to shore up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structures</ENAMEX> believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> began such work after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> tremblor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southern California</ENAMEX> , when numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> collapsed .
     `` We had just finished phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadway</ENAMEX> from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DOT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> said .
     After completing installation of the jackets on `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> frame '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DOT</ENAMEX> had sent the project over to its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> to draw up a final design .
     Knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said the project had been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets .
     The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , then connecting them more securely to the double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadbed</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 50 million</NUMEX> .
     The collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">span</ENAMEX> has provoked surprise and anger among state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Deukmejian</ENAMEX> , who said he had been assured by state transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> could withstand an even larger quake , called for an immediate investigation .
     `` I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">186,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Katz</ENAMEX> , a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> who is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Assembly</ENAMEX> 's transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> .
     He said he would convene hearings within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1957</TIMEX> , and as such , like many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
     The northern piers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">span</ENAMEX> lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">1906 quake</ENAMEX> .
     Transportation department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , however , said they were as surprised as anyone by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cypress</ENAMEX> destruction .
     They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well , although they were working on ways to bolster them .
     `` Unfortunately , there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes , and that is an earthquake , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burch Bachtold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> .
     He said : `` We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to '' reinforce the columns .

     The meeting had been scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 10</TIMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> delayed the meeting to allow time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to review the proposal .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , pledging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> to follow suit .
     Both hope to encourage pressure for change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> still ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Stalinist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holdouts</ENAMEX> by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> and , to a lesser extent , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also have the special goal of holding out hope for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's fledgling reform movement .

     Democracy can be cruel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> : Sometimes it forces them to make choices .
     Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> opened the door on the subject of abortion , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> are squinting under the glare of democratic choice .
     Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> are squinting most painfully , at least at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , which is only fair because they 've been shielded the most .
     So long as abortion was a question for litigation , not legislation , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> could find political security in absolutism .
     They could attract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-issue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> by adopting the right-to-life movement 's strongest position , even as pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> it matters .
     Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> thought it detected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in a characteristic waffle on abortion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only a month ago</TIMEX> he 'd warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> passed it anyway , he hinted he was looking for compromise .
     Was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who once was pro-choice , but later pro-life , converting again ?
     In fact , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's dance was more wiggle than waffle .
     Pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> never wavered over the veto .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Smith</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , never eager for a fight , was happy to try , which is why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> said he was looking for `` flexibility '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> refused to budge , pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> met at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> quickly signaled a veto .
     Amid charges of `` timidity '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> and elsewhere , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> was n't about to offend his most energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> vote , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> defected .
     After the vote , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Johnson</ENAMEX> rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> urging him not to veto .
     Even such a pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalwart</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> -RRB- had counseled some kind of compromise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> passed the same bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , with a veto-proof majority of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> .
     The manuevering illustrates an emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> donnybrook , pacified since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">1988 GOP convention</ENAMEX> , abortion was barely discussed at all , though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> made a passionate statement to the platform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> , but she was talking to herself .
     Now many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> are listening .
     They 're frightened by what they see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> , where pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> are being pummeled on abortion .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Mahe</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , says the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> .
     -LRB- In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Coleman</ENAMEX> and his running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddy Dalton</ENAMEX> , are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest . -RRB-
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahe</ENAMEX> adds , `` The net loser in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> is the right-to-life side . ''
    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Darla St. Martin</ENAMEX> , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Right to Life Committee</ENAMEX> , says exit polls from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> election had single-issue , pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> giving Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> more percentage points of support than pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's opening of debate may have changed even that .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Newhouse</ENAMEX> , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Wirthlin Group</ENAMEX> , says polls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> showed that the single-issue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> had about evened out .
     Polls are no substitute for principle , but they 'll do for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> , a divisive litmus test .
     It 's already that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Fulton</ENAMEX> lost a chance for a senior job in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> after right-to-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> opposed him .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldwell Butler</ENAMEX> , a conservative former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> , was barred from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Legal Services</ENAMEX> post , after he gave wrong answers on abortion .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton Lee</ENAMEX> , has said on the record that he 'd love to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon general</ENAMEX> but could n't pass the pro-life test .
     In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HHS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> , the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> .
     After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> waffled on abortion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> appeased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-to-lifers</ENAMEX> by surrounding him with pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> .
     Their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter , though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HHS</ENAMEX> spends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> a year on both .
     It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> can gloat at all this for now , they may want to contain their glee .
     On abortion , their own day will come .
     Eventually even <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism .
     Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> favor parental consent for teen-age abortions ?
     -LRB- The pro-choice lobby does n't .
     -RRB- What about banning abortions in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third trimesters</TIMEX> ?
     -LRB- The lobby says no again . -RRB-
     Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise , toward the unpolarizing middle .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe v. Wade</ENAMEX> pre-empted political debate , so the extremes blossomed .
     Now the ambivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middle</ENAMEX> , a moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> of sorts , is reasserting itself .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> , the outcome in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted , but not completely banned .
     This is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> are , which is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> usually end up .
