     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it plans to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</NUMEX> in notes and bonds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> , but said the auctions will be postponed unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Basham</ENAMEX> , deputy assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> for federal finance , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> may wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> or even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early Tuesday</TIMEX> to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .
     Unless it can raise money in financial markets , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basham</ENAMEX> said , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> wo n't have the cash to pay off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.8 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills that mature on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     Without congressional action , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> ca n't sell any new securities -- even savings bonds .
     But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is almost certain to act in time to avoid default .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Each day</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> fails to act ... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule , possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> said in a speech prepared for delivery <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> .
     `` To avoid these costs , and a possible default , immediate action is imperative . ''
     The securities to be sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> will raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 billion</NUMEX> in cash and redeem <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion</NUMEX> in maturing notes .
     The new securities , part of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> refunding , will consist of :
     -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> notes , to be auctioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and to mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15 , 1992</TIMEX> .
     -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes , to be auctioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> and to mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15 , 1999</TIMEX> .
     -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds , to be auctioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and to mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 15 , 2019</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> also said it plans to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">36-day</TIMEX> cash management bills on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     They will mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 21</TIMEX> .
     None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> approves an increase in the debt ceiling , clearing the way for a formal offering , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basham</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it needs to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47.5 billion</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">current quarter</TIMEX> in order to end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion</NUMEX> cash balance .
     Auctions held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> and those scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> will raise a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.6 billion</NUMEX> .
     The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.9 billion</NUMEX> could be raised through the sale of short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> notes in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first three months</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> estimates that it will have to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion</NUMEX> , assuming that it decides to aim for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> cash balance at the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> took advantage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's stock rally to book some profits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , leaving stocks up fractionally .
     Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished less than a point higher to close at 2645.90 in moderate trading .
     But advancing issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> were tidily ahead of declining stocks , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">847</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">644</NUMEX> .
     Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> debt this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> .
     Continuing demand for dollars from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> boosted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> were disappointed that the enthusiasm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> showed for stocks in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.18 billion</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> evaporated so quickly .
     The industrial average jumped more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> rushed to buy shares of potential takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">targets</ENAMEX> .
     But with the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">year</TIMEX> in sight , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in
     Economic news had little effect on financial markets .
     As expected , a national purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ' report indicated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Beige Book</ENAMEX> , a summary of economic conditions across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154.2 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Bond prices were up .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond gained about a quarter of a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> of face amount .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Simmons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> offered to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf Corp.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> , stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     The offer follows an earlier proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> rebuffed that offer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> and said it would study other alternatives .
     However , it has n't yet made any proposals to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> said it reviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> proposal as well as interests from `` <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> '' regarding business combinations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> said it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are being held with interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> , and work is also continuing on other various transactions . ''
     It did n't elaborate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> , an aggressive and persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , wo n't leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> alone until some kind of transaction is completed .
     `` He has clamped on their ankle like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Leming</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co</ENAMEX> .
     `` He appears to be in it for the long haul . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> already own a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.9 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> is officially making the offer .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leming</ENAMEX> was n't surprised by the lower price cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> , saying he believes that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55</NUMEX> a share is `` the most you can pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> before it becomes a bad acquisition . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.75</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 51.25</NUMEX> a share , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> shares closed unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.75</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valhi</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62.5 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> , all in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Landis Martin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> cut the price they were proposing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> because they initially planned a transaction that included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 250 million</NUMEX> in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt .
     However , the junk-bond market has collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed .
     Now , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> plans to put in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">`` several hundred million '' dollars</NUMEX> in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt .
     He also said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> reduced its offer because it was n't allowed to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> 's confidential financial information without agreeing that it would n't make an offer unless it had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> 's consent .
     In a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry R.

     It was n't clear how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> would respond if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> spurns them again .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> said they have n't yet decided what their next move would be , but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     In other transactions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> has n't been eager to negotiate with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NL</ENAMEX> , a specialty chemicals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> apparently believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is interested in some kind of transaction .
     The management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 18 %</NUMEX> of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , and would stand to gain <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> were sold .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.85</NUMEX> a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.85</NUMEX> a share on fewer shares outstanding .

     Criticism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> over recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> acquisitions is looming ever larger in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> ' relations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> from both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> 's skittishness about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment could color a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     Not that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> disagree on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Where they disagree is on the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> direct investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> denies there are real barriers .
     The heated talk stirred up by recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Structural Impediments Initiative</ENAMEX> .

     At the same time , though , he chastised the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for paying such close attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment when other foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , are acquiring more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> assets .
     Fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> have escalated sharply in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">past several weeks</TIMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> 's purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ENAMEX> 's acquisition of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> of some of midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> 's most exclusive real estate .
     Even before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> of one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens Jr .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oilman</ENAMEX> has acquired a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.2 %</NUMEX> stake valued at more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> in an automotive-lighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Koito Manufacturing Co .</ENAMEX>
     But he has failed to gain any influence at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Koito</ENAMEX> has refused to grant Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> seats on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , asserting he is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greenmailer</ENAMEX> trying to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Koito</ENAMEX> 's other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> into buying him out at a profit .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> made considerable political <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> with his troubles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> , chaired by a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trade Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> to use Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> 's experience in talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> `` to highlight this problem facing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who seek access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> capital markets . ''
     While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dallara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> markets may get a disproportionate share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week</TIMEX> 's talks .
     Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">side</ENAMEX> has a litany of recommendations for the other .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> says it is anxious for results .
     `` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dallara</ENAMEX> says .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides</ENAMEX> have agreed that the talks will be most successful if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed .
     But they have n't clarified what those might be .
     After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of meetings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> complained that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> retort that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round was too early to make concessions .
     `` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     `` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . ''
     That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> say , no matter how badly the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants quick results .
     For instance , at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meeting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides</ENAMEX> could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions .
     Since then , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">MITI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Commerce Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , they hope to have a sheaf of documents both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">sides</ENAMEX> can trust .
     `` Little by little , there is progress , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">MITI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .

     While worry grows about big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's big trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are rapidly increasing their stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's smaller business .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , the controversial trend improves access to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> markets and technology .
     But for small <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help .
     Take the deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Candela Laser Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wayland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of high-tech medical devices , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> set its sights on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> as an export market .
     Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> trying to penetrate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Candela</ENAMEX> turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , for investment .
     In a joint-venture deal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> guided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Candela</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's bureaucratic maze .
     It eventually secured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Health</ENAMEX> import approval for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Candela</ENAMEX> laser products -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that breaks up <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney stones</ENAMEX> and another that treats skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> .
     At last count , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Candela</ENAMEX> had sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</NUMEX> of its medical devices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The deal also gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> access to a high-tech medical product .
     `` They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Olsen</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Candela</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , the favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> is one whose research and development can be milked for future <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> use .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> bankroll many small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> wo n't touch .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have financed small and medium-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , but in recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> , the pace has taken off .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first half of 1989</TIMEX> alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 214 million</NUMEX> in minority positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61 %</NUMEX> rise from the figure for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , reports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture Economics Inc</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Needham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> tracks investments in new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , of course , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments involved outright purchase of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Heightened <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> parallels an acceleration of investments giving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> control of large , highly visible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , it was announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate Co.</ENAMEX> had acquired a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> .
     While the small deals are far less conspicuous , they add to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> penetration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
     As the deals also improve <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> access to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> technology and market knowledge , they feed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> anxieties in this area , too .
     Even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Free State Glass Industries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warrenton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fabricator</ENAMEX> of architectural glass , was foundering under its original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi International Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Corp.</ENAMEX> , bought controlling interest in the glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Bodner</ENAMEX> , a glass industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .
     The deal is chiefly designed to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> a window on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> glass industry , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ichiro Wakui</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> 's general merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's not just a simple investment in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakui</ENAMEX> says .
     `` We want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> 's investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Free State</ENAMEX> is `` very small ... less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</NUMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakui</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodner</ENAMEX> declines to comment on the arrangement .
     Trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui , C. Itoh &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissho-Iwai Corp.</ENAMEX> , which make many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> , have no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">counterpart</ENAMEX> .
     These vertically integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">combines</ENAMEX> , some of which got their start in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .
     They operate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ships</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     `` All the `` sogo-shosha '' are looking for new business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Klauser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui , U.S.A.</ENAMEX> , using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> term for the largest of the global trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> .
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takeshi Kondo</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C. Itoh America Inc.</ENAMEX> : `` We have a great interest in making investments , particularly in new ventures . ''

     Profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal .
     `` Strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture Economics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     In investing on the basis of future transactions , a role often performed by merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can cut through the logjam that small-company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> often face with their local commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's the classic problem of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Davies</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trading Alliance Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are very unsympathetic .
     They want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can generate . ''
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klauser</ENAMEX> : `` Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows .
     To the extent they can do this , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klauser</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> in which it holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> interest or more and the trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> hopes to double the number of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie Driskill</ENAMEX> went to her neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> because it was convenient .
     A high-balance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> pine for , she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Atlanta National Bank</ENAMEX> introduced its Crown Account , a package designed to lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> such as Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Driskill</ENAMEX> .
     Among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans .
     All she had to do was put <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> personal line of credit .
     `` I deserve something for my loyalty , '' she says .
     She took her business to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Atlanta</ENAMEX> .
     So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     For nearly a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decade</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have competed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .
     The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are turning away from strict price competition .
     Instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> .
     `` You 're dead in the water if you are n't segmenting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Moore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Synergistics Research Corp.</ENAMEX> , a bank consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NCNB Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> just starting careers .
     The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18,000</NUMEX> , but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Planters Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , launched The Edge account , a package designed for the `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">thirtysomething</TIMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans .
     The theory : Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> , many with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , are in their prime borrowing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> -- and , having borrowed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , they may continue to use it for other services in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later years</TIMEX> .
     For some time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have been aiming packages at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> , the demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> with the highest savings .
     Those efforts are being stepped up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judie MacDonald</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of retail sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barnett Banks Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jacksonville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> now targets sub-segments within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market</ENAMEX> by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles .
     `` Varying age , geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacDonald</ENAMEX> says .
     She says individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barnett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests .
     `` An active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55-year-old</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boca Raton</ENAMEX> may care more about <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Senior Olympic games</ENAMEX> , while a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">75-year-old</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Panama City</ENAMEX> may care more about a seminar on health , '' she says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> have tried packaging before .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> fee .
     The concept begot a slew of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">copycats</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> stopped promoting the packages .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big reason : thin margins .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' earnings were squeezed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1970s</TIMEX> , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs .
     But now computers are enabling more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to analyze their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> by age , income and geography .
     They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> .
     Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs .
     Where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits .
     The competition has grown more intense as bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norwest Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> extend their market-share battles into small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> is worrying about local , regional and money-center -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> -RCB- , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">credit unions</ENAMEX> , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Synergistics Research</ENAMEX> .
     `` So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who were n't even thinking about targeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> are scrambling to define their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer base</ENAMEX> . ''
     The competition has cultivated a much savvier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> .
     `` The average household will spread <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> accounts over a dozen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">financial institutions</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael P. Sullivan</ENAMEX> , who runs his own bank consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C</ENAMEX> .
     `` This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's rate-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> costly . ''
     Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for doing the bulk of their banking in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">place</ENAMEX> .
     For their troubles , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> get a larger captive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate .
     The more accounts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> have , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> that offers it .
     That can pay off down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , especially the younger ones , change from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers\/investors</ENAMEX> .
     Packaging has some drawbacks .
     The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> spent more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jacob</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of marketing .
     `` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX> says .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">These days</TIMEX> , banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> says .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are already moving in that direction , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvin T. Sale</ENAMEX> , marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> , he says , now has packages for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> customer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> .
     Soon , it will split those into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> .
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sale</ENAMEX> : `` I think more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boutique</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> like pocket change -- they do n't think much about it .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> said it plans to institute an additional `` circuit breaker '' aimed at stemming market slides .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Phelan</ENAMEX> told a closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> subcommittee meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> that he would support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> halts of program trading during market emergencies .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> said he does n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program trading , arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> could get around such a limit .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Merc</ENAMEX> said a new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-hour</TIMEX> price limit would take effect in its Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&amp;P 500 futures fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> index points -- the equivalent of about a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-point limit is triggered after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:30 p.m . Chicago time</TIMEX> , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:15 p.m .</TIMEX>
     With the limit in effect , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday Oct. 13</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well .
     Late that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> the S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> index points , hitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> said that its existing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-point</NUMEX> limit on S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures trading -LRB- equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials -RRB- , which was triggered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , will remain in effect .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Melamed</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> executive committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , said that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> maintained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     All of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> also said that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> respite during market sell-offs , will become the maximum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> limit for the S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures contract ; the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> limit now is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> index points .
     A final modification was made to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-point opening limit for the contract .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-point limit will remain in effect for the first <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> of trading .
     The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> of trading .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> that the collar , which banned program trades through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> points , did n't work well .
     He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> could get around the collar by executing trades manually .
     In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> finance and telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> that he would support the program-trading halt proposal `` providing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill .
     The program-trading issue is heating up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> as it is on Wall Street , and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> want to grant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> suggested that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . ''
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> angered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> said we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> added .
     At another point during the hearing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> what would be discussed at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York exchange</ENAMEX> board meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is likely to study the program-trading issue .
     That response annoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> said , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> attended the hearing , most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , who has been willing to let Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markey</ENAMEX> carry the legislation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> expressed concern , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
     The futures industry is regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> , which reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parishioners</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">St. Michael and All Angels</ENAMEX> stop to chat at the church door , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> here always have .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> bells that first sounded here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1614</TIMEX> .
     But there is also a discordant , modern note in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Aslacton</ENAMEX> , though it ca n't be heard by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">church-goers</ENAMEX> enjoying the peal of bells this cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> .
     Like most of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> with sets of bells , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">St. Michael</ENAMEX> once had its own `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">band</ENAMEX> '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> , who would herald every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> service .
     Now , only one local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> remains : <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">64-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Hammond</ENAMEX> .
     The others here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> live elsewhere .
     They belong to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> -- including two <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">octogenarians</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> in training -- who drive every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">belfries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">East Anglia</ENAMEX> .
     `` To ring for even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> service at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> , a retired water-authority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 've tried to train the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> , but they have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">discos</ENAMEX> and their dances , and they just drift away . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East Anglian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that keeps the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Aslacton</ENAMEX> bells pealing .
     History , after all , is not on his side .
     According to a nationwide survey taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">England</ENAMEX> 's church bells are no longer rung on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> because there is no one to ring them .
     It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
     The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , is considered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> to be childish , fit only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> .
     Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> invented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">380 years ago</TIMEX> , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
     Proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">churches</ENAMEX> , as many as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> bells .
     Then , at a signal , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
     Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ringers</ENAMEX> memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
     A series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three hours</TIMEX> .
     A look at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> practice at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">St. Mary Abbot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kensington</ENAMEX> district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> gives an idea of the work involved .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> shirt-sleeved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> stand in a circle , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot ahead of the other in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prize-fighter</ENAMEX> 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chamber</ENAMEX> .
     No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
     Totally absorbed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
     Far above in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">belfry</ENAMEX> , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">360 degrees</NUMEX> , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
     Skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
     In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy L. Sayers</ENAMEX> described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ringers</ENAMEX> , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''
     `` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanie Pattenden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">band</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">St. Mary Abbot</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">England</ENAMEX> 's best female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> .
     It is a passion that usually stays in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> , however .
     More often than not , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> as something stuck on the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">belfry</ENAMEX> .
     When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> often skip off to the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pub</ENAMEX> , leaving worship for others below .
     This does not sit well with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerics</ENAMEX> .
     With membership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Church of England</ENAMEX> steadily dwindling , strong-willed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicars</ENAMEX> are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> to attend services .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Hummerstone</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Great Torrington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Devon</ENAMEX> , got so fed up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> who did n't attend service he sacked the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">band</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> promptly set up a picket line in protest .
     `` They were a self-perpetuating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">club</ENAMEX> that treated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> as sort of a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">premises</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vicar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hummerstone</ENAMEX> says .
     An entirely new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">band</ENAMEX> rings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Great Torrington</ENAMEX> , several of whom are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> .
     But there still are n't enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> to ring more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> bells .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">St. Mary 's Church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ilminster</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Somerset</ENAMEX> , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.D. Jones</ENAMEX> , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.J.B. Marshall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicar</ENAMEX> of a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> that are located next to the altar .
     `` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> from above , making a very obvious exit while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> is at prayer , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vicar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicar</ENAMEX> and an active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bell-ringer</ENAMEX> himself .
     `` The sound of bells is a net to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     `` I live in hopes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Central Council of Church Bell Ringers</ENAMEX> , a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parliament</ENAMEX> of ringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , aims to improve relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicars</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Baldwin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     It hopes to speak to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at theological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicar</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> entitled , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Bells in Your Care</ENAMEX> . ''
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> is also attacking the greater problem : lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> .
     One survey says that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bellringers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">England</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 40,000</NUMEX> of them still ring .
     Also , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">parishes</ENAMEX> and inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">churches</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">council</ENAMEX> 's program to attract and train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> is only partly successful , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> .
     `` Right now , we 're lucky if after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> we keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> , '' he adds .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> bright sign is that a growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have entered the once male-dominated field ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
     The oldest bell-ringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Ancient Society of College Youths</ENAMEX> , founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1637</TIMEX> , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> is the sole source of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's most prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">churches</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">St. Paul 's Cathedral</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Westminster Abbey</ENAMEX> .
     This being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> in a series of letters to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Ringing World</ENAMEX> , '' a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX> .
     One <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> , '' remarked on the `` frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tea</ENAMEX> at meetings . ''
     In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Solihull</ENAMEX> observed that `` the average male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> wrote from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sheffield</ENAMEX> to say that in her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">60 years</TIMEX> of ringing , `` I have never known a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> to faint in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">belfry</ENAMEX> .
     I have seen one or two <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> die , bless them .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> dividend checks .
     That has been particularly true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> with many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> raising their payouts more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     But do n't breathe too easy : Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> warn .
     In the past , they say , the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over .
     That can be a trap for unwary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bernstein</ENAMEX> , senior quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     Strong dividend growth , he says , is `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">black widow</ENAMEX> of valuation '' -- a reference to the female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spiders</ENAMEX> that attract males and then kill them after mating .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund , explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time .
     `` Invariably , those strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">periods</TIMEX> in the economy give way to recessionary environments , '' he says .
     `` And recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market . ''
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , for example , dividends on the stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's 500-stock index soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> , following much slower growth the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year before</TIMEX> .
     The S&amp;P index started sliding in price in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1976</TIMEX> , and fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> -- despite a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> expansion in dividends <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that year</TIMEX> .
     That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> anxious .
     Payouts on the S&amp;P 500 stocks rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , and Wall Street estimates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> growth are generally <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 9 % and 14 %</NUMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe the growth in dividends will slow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , although a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> see double-digit gains continuing .
     Meanwhile , many market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices .
     As a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards .
     Put another way , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay , some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&amp;P 500 .
     The figure is currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3.3 %</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2 %</NUMEX> before the recent market slide .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> .
     A drop below that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , `` the market has always tanked .
     Always .
     There 's never been an exception , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald W. Perritt</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , based on a review of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> of stock-market data .
     The last time the S&amp;P 500 yield dropped below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> was in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer of 1987</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stockholders</ENAMEX> who took the hint and sold shares escaped the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> debacle .
     There have been only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> other times -- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1933</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1961</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1965</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1968</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> -- when the yield on the S&amp;P 500 dropped below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> for at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two consecutive months</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perritt</ENAMEX> found .
     And in each case , he says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     Still , some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the current <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> past .
     `` It 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> are not behaving in a traditional manner , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H. Coxon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of stock investments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> .
     In particular , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coxon</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are paying out a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">smaller percentage</NUMEX> of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically .
     So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .
     Rather than increasing dividends , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven G. Einhorn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-chairman</ENAMEX> of the investment policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3.6 %</NUMEX> .
     That is just a tad below the average of the past <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">40 years</TIMEX> or so , he says .
     What will happen to dividend growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> ?
     Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&amp;P 500 dividends of just under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , down from an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">other years</TIMEX> in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> expects in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> to a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Doerflinger</ENAMEX> .
     The minority argument , meanwhile , is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken .
     Dividend growth on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> is expected by both Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coxon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einhorn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> .
     Those dividend <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX> argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> indicator <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> might want to watch is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> tally from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> of the number of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> adjusting their dividends .
     A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> raised dividends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , basically unchanged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     That followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four straight months</TIMEX> in which the number of increases trailed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> pace .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes , a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einhorn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> estimates the stock market will deliver a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 % to 15 %</NUMEX> total return from appreciation and dividends over the next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">12 months</TIMEX> -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 % or 8 %</NUMEX> if dividend growth is weak .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> , who also expects <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> growth in dividends <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much .
     `` Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says .
     With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels .

     Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> page-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story on the renewed plight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Graham Bell</ENAMEX> 's offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph .
     Such is hardly the case .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardner G.

     This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> 's patents went .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> indeed wanted to get into the telephone business .
     It acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Edison</ENAMEX> 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Co.</ENAMEX> claiming that the microphone invented by my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emile Berliner</ENAMEX> , which had been sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> for a princely <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000</NUMEX> , infringed upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edison</ENAMEX> patent .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> established that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX> patent caveat was registered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 days</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edison</ENAMEX> 's application , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's current plight .

     It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> 's first visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> that set in motion the historic rapprochement between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     But the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , during which he spoke at length with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> relationship .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> , the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , harped on international outrage over the massacre .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> , in turn , took aim at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> `` interference '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's domestic affairs .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">newspaper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Legal Daily</ENAMEX> , even directly criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> , who is normally referred to here as an `` old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">paper</ENAMEX> accused him of being a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase to describe what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> believes is the policy of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> to seduce socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> into the capitalist sphere .
     The tension was evident on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> 's final banquet toast , normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship .
     Instead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> reminded his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Shangkun</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have n't forgiven <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> for the military assault of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 3-4</TIMEX> that killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> , and perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> .
     `` Many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> , including many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> , who was directly involved in ordering the attack .
     `` The events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> damaged the respect and confidence which most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> previously had for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion .
     In talks with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was prominently involved in the demonstrations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this spring</TIMEX> .
     In a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> , told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> , `` Frankly speaking , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> not long ago .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> was the real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">victim</ENAMEX> and it is unjust to reprove <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> for it . ''
     Despite the harsh exchanges , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> referred to as `` the greatest crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> relations '' since his initial visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17 years ago</TIMEX> .
     In his return toast to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> said the relationship had reached a `` stalemate . ''
     Relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> have been tense since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 7</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissident</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fang Lizhi</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Shuxian</ENAMEX> , took refuge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
     Shortly afterwards , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> imposed a series of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> sanctions , including suspension of most high-level talks , which could be codified in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> congressional legislation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming weeks</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> is traveling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> as a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoy</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">administration</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> met Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> , before coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> .
     And he plans to brief the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the end of the week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> was to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> raised a number of controversial issues in his <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 hours</TIMEX> of talks with top-level <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     These included <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's economic policies , human rights and the question of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fang</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> also proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> restore its participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Fulbright Program</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> government-funded academic exchange .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> pulled out of the program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     In his talks , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to acknowledge that their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> is part of the world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas .
     `` Ideas are going over borders , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     There are no signs , however , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's yielding on key issues .
     But in one minor matter , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> appears to have gained a concession .
     In a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Premier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Peng</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said that he hoped he would n't encounter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">machine guns</ENAMEX> during his visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> .
     Sure enough , when he arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">embassy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days later</TIMEX> , the machine-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">gun</ENAMEX>-toting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> were gone -- for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five months</TIMEX> .
     A few blocks away , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> encircling the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">compound</ENAMEX> also had discarded their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Uzi</ENAMEX>-model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early June</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> there retained their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">pistols</ENAMEX> , and a large contingent of plainclothes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> remained nearby in unmarked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> continue to harass <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> , who have filed several protests with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">past week</TIMEX> .
     Several times , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> have pointed their automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">rifles</ENAMEX> at young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> and clicked the trigger .

     Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images , but they should realize that the most important thing is real change , not changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's perceptions .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are seriously considering their survival , they could do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> ; improve working conditions -LRB- better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">offices</ENAMEX> and more vacations , for example -RRB- ; accept and hire more labor from outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .

     In reference to your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 9</TIMEX> page-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX> Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> , '' it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives : `` Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> have positive views of her , while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> approve of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's job performance .
     In part , this may reflect the fact that ` she speaks a more progressive language ' than her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof .</ENAMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LCB- Ethel -RCB- Klein</ENAMEX> puts it .
     Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 %</NUMEX> have a favorable opinion of her , compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62 %</NUMEX> who approve of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> 's performance .
     While a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX> of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> disapprove of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's handling of his job , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15 %</NUMEX> have a negative view of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> . ''
     The statistics imply that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> approve of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's job performance and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> approve of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> find Mr. and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy .
     Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective .
     Why are we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .

     Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , they will simply emigrate to foreign stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">markets</ENAMEX> .
     But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say a number of hurdles loom .
     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> trying to shrug off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is `` very concerned '' about the possible effects of program trading , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> stock plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock-index futures are n't even traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> now .
     And because of the time difference , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and the U.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">markets</ENAMEX> ' trading hours do n't overlap .
     It all adds up to a barrier to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-style index arbitrage , the most popular form of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and the price of a futures contract in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> based on those stocks .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 11.6 %</NUMEX> of all program trading by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> took place in foreign markets , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> data .
     Yet it is difficult to imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> racing to introduce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-style stock-index futures .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> already is scrutinizing institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makato Utsumi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice minister</ENAMEX> for international finance .
     Program trading has taken off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Osaka</ENAMEX> stock exchanges .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> are wary .
     They have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 7</TIMEX> , when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last half-hour</TIMEX> of trading , startling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market operators</ENAMEX> the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .
     `` Maybe it was n't enough , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> noted after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 7</TIMEX> surge .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> have since tightened controls on index-related stock purchases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's leading program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> are the big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> , though the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are playing catch-up .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , notably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , have reaped a hefty chunk of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> earnings from index arbitrage , both for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and for their own accounts .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> joined a growing list of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts . -RRB-
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deryck C. Maughan</ENAMEX> , who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John S. Wadsworth</ENAMEX> , who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> there , ascribe a good part of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' success in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to their ability to offer sophisticated , futures-related investment strategies to big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     They do n't have plans to cut back .
     `` It has not been disruptive in the markets here , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maughan</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The real difference seems to be that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> also are scrutinizing program trades .
     Index-arbitrage trading is `` something we want to watch closely , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We do n't think there is cause for concern <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the moment</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> has several attractions .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> stock trading tapes .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , it can be used to unwind positions before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading begins , but at prices pegged to the previous session 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> close .
     In addition to the extra privacy of these trades , the transactions can often be less expensive to execute , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> 's fee .
     Still , `` Much less -LCB- index-arbitrage activity -RCB- is done over here than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Barfield</ENAMEX> , chief investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard Life Assurance Co.</ENAMEX> , which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 15 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.72 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> institutional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main index-arbitrage instruments .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index option contract is traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Traded Options Market</ENAMEX> .
     And an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FT-SE</ENAMEX> futures contract is traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London International Financial Futures Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Both contracts have gained a following since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> global market crash .
     The average number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FT-SE</ENAMEX> option contracts traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , the average of daily contracts traded totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,118</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,645</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">917</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     But a survey early this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> indicated that the volume of index-options trading was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15 %</NUMEX> of the size of the underlying equity market , exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     This compares with estimates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> `` derivatives '' market is perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as large as the underlying domestic market .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , casting a solid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">382</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> vote for a compromise measure backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90-cent</NUMEX>-an-hour rise , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1991</TIMEX> , is too small for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of jobs .
     But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , after congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise .
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">both sides</ENAMEX> accepted the compromise , which would lead to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> lifting of the minimum wage since a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> law was enacted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> , raising the wage to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.35</NUMEX> an hour from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.65</NUMEX> .
     Under the measure passed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the minimum wage would rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.80</NUMEX> next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
     `` There are no smiles about this bill , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Williams</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mont</ENAMEX> . -RRB- said during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> floor debate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But `` because it 's all we 've got , I 'm going to vote for it . ''
     While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the average <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturing wage , the level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> will still be less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> of average factory pay , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> said .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marge Roukema</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J</ENAMEX> . -RRB- instead praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administrations</ENAMEX> have sought for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> .
     Adopting a training-wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roukema</ENAMEX> said .
     Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrants</ENAMEX> into the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     Labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration insistence .
     The compromise sets the training wage at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.35</NUMEX> an hour next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.61</NUMEX> an hour , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of the minimum wage , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1991</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Employers</ENAMEX> can pay the subminimum for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 days</TIMEX> , without restriction , to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> of job experience , and for another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 days</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> uses a government-certified training program for the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     The training wage covers only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">16 to 19 years old</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> previously insisted on an unrestricted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> training wage that could be paid any time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> of any age took a new job .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> , still opposed to any mininum-wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> in two stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between April 1990 and April 1991</TIMEX> `` will be impossible for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and higher prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
