     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Venezuelan</ENAMEX> currency plummeted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , making it difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> there to afford imported parts .

     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age eight</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Baker</ENAMEX> was sent by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">basement</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 19</TIMEX> , she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> sensation , transformed from unwanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to international sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just over a decade</TIMEX> .
     It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
     Only the bravest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirits</ENAMEX> survive such roller coasters .
     And , for Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , the ride was far from over .
     Her bare breasts , her dancing , her voice , her beauty and , perhaps most famously , her derriere , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bricktop</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who found a measure of fame in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine</ENAMEX> 's . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> were a constant complication .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had lots of them .
     But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust .
     As she saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy .
     Her appetite for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> also was large .
     She adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of assorted races , naming them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rainbow Tribe</ENAMEX> , and driving her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to despair and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina</ENAMEX> .
     She made money , but spent more .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> pitched in .
     Finally , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grace</ENAMEX> saved her with the offer of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Monaco</ENAMEX> .
     Another lifelong complication , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Rose</ENAMEX> makes clear in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">321</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.50</NUMEX> -RRB- , was racism .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had the good luck to arrive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1925</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> had become exotic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> art was in vogue and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> .
     To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> was a friendly island in a racist world .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had bitter experience of bigotry from her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> childhood and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">her days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">theater</ENAMEX> , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> loved her at first sight .
     `` She just wiggled her fanny and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Jolas</ENAMEX> , not entirely inaccurately .
     `` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> writes .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose </ENAMEX>, who teaches literature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Wesleyan University</ENAMEX> , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">centuries</TIMEX> of tributes to the callipygous .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Jazz Cleopatra</ENAMEX> '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works .
     It is easy to see why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , a free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> who broke many of the restraints convention places on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , attracts Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Parallel Lives</ENAMEX> , '' a wonderful study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Victorian</ENAMEX> marriage .
     Still , even the title raises questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> 's vision of her subject .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
     To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> , requires an equal stretch .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">68 years old</TIMEX> when she died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life .
     In fact , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> played scenes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Casablanca</ENAMEX> that could have made it into `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Casablanca</ENAMEX> . ''
     During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazis</ENAMEX> were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 2 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> .
     She was devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles de Gaulle</ENAMEX> 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> and then a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-woman <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">USO</ENAMEX> tour for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Free France</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey Bogart</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">nightclub</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Laszlo</ENAMEX> leads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Free French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sympathizers</ENAMEX> in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">La Marseillaise</ENAMEX> '' to drown out the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazis</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> occupied all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Casablanca</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Free French</ENAMEX> wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">J'ai deux amours</ENAMEX> '' they wept .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> is best on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early years</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> .
     In her introduction , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> writes that she feels she has much in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , but as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Jazz Cleopatra</ENAMEX> '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> were growing less interested .
     It does n't help that sometimes Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> 's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> chapter opens : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> was not one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's glorious moments . ''
     Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> rather than underdressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> writes : `` She was a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">impersonator</ENAMEX> who happened to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> who fell under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> 's spell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963</TIMEX> and began collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> memorabilia was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Hammond</ENAMEX> .
     In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Josephine Baker</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Cape</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">304</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35</NUMEX> -RRB- , which was published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and distributed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> .
     The text by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick O'Connor</ENAMEX> is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hemingway</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> `` The most sensational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> anybody ever saw .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> , having rid itself of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> , now sells <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fiberglass</ENAMEX> , forest products , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">minerals</ENAMEX> and industrial goods .
     Heady stuff it 's not .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> 's ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> , is controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> , which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entity</ENAMEX> that is settling claims with asbestos <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     When and if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> stock to cash .
     But as an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> say there is a good chance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> will , instead , seek to convert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .
     `` Their principal asset is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> common stock , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Halis</ENAMEX> , who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sabre Associates</ENAMEX> , an investment fund that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> shares .
     `` If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
     What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> or cause a recapitalization of all shares . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> stock .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     Its cash and liquid securities fell by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 338 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first six months of 1989</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> also will receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> a year starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> on a bond it holds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> .
     And , beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , it will have a claim on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> net income .
     Even so , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> would seem to be facing a cash crunch .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> , it had settled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 15,000</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81,000</NUMEX> received claims from asbestos <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , for an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40,424</NUMEX> each .
     -LRB- The average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     And as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear</TIMEX> , settled but unpaid claims amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 136 million</NUMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> 's total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 268 million</NUMEX> in cash and marketable securities .
     `` At some point , we 're going to need an infusion of funds , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> says .
     Even before then , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> may be eager to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> stock .
     It does n't pay a dividend , and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> needs income .
     Moreover , with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88 %</NUMEX> of its assets tied up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> , the trust is badly in need of diversification .
     `` Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> itself does n't rule out a restructuring .
     Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bullock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of investor relations , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured .
     We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says .
     Of course , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> option would be for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> to buy out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> for only its shares before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1993</TIMEX> .
     And both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trust</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> name .
     Thus , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> 's other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is a rare case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with a big majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> which will probably act in the interests of the minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> , '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> says .
     Even if there is no restructuring , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> seems to be attractive long-term .
     Its stock , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 5\/8</NUMEX> , trades at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8 1\/2</NUMEX> times estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with recession-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bullock</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> of revenues are tied to construction .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> predict little or no near-term growth .
     They are , nonetheless , high on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> 's management .
     `` It 's one of the best in the business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Dobi</ENAMEX> .
     And he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> has the financial flexibility to buy other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> at the best possible moment when other construction-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are hurting and selling cheap .
     With a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -- and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 329 million</NUMEX> in cash -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> is indeed actively on the prowl .
     So far , as a price-conscious shopper , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> has n't bought much .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kleinaitis</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duff & Phelps</ENAMEX> , says , `` Even though they have borrowing power , they have been disciplined about acquisitions . ''
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleinaitis</ENAMEX> says that with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of its stock in friendly hands , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville</ENAMEX> is the rare publicly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> is preparing a plan to sell a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake in its large real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> public employee pension fund for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> , after which it would spin off the realty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     The plan places an indicated value on the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp.</ENAMEX> , of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> are expected to review the plan at a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the transaction .
     If approved , the sale is expected to close by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> , with the spinoff occurring by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1992</TIMEX> .
     In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.625</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ENAMEX> is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> land and building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> whose prime properties include <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">1,850 undeveloped acres</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , and several office sites .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the properties survived without significant damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Northern California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     As a result of the partial sale and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">spinoff</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Public Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX> would obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> , who described the plan .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> confirmed that negotiations were being held with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> .
     Also holding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seats each on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , they said , would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX> , controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmann</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Itel Corp.</ENAMEX> , controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Zell</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmanns</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zell</ENAMEX> , the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> stock , have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Itel</ENAMEX> bought a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sante Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX> later purchased about a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake ; they would have interests in the new realty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in line with their holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sante Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> .
     The sale and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">spinoff</ENAMEX> of the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> into free-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> for its railroad and energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , as well as real estate .
     The debt-laden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> has been under pressure from large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> to boost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's share price .
     At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> is unusual .
     Pension funds rarely own as much as a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , pension funds are rarely given seats on company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns .
     But fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ENAMEX> investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> properties .
     It also marks a `` major commitment to -LCB- real estate -RCB- development , which we have n't been involved with before , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Hanson </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     Under the proposed plan , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> would also lend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> Realty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second year</TIMEX> at the then-prevailing market price .
     The note would accrue interest at the rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5 %</NUMEX> a year , which would be payable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen E. Roulac</ENAMEX> , a real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> working for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> .
     The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roulac</ENAMEX> said .
     The spun-off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> `` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with a prime portfolio , '' he said .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> has redirected its real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio .
     Real estate operating income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71.9 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 143 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     In a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Krebs</ENAMEX> , said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ENAMEX> would repay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 500 million</NUMEX> in debt owed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> before the planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">spinoff</ENAMEX> .
     That would help reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> 's remaining debt to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 600 million</NUMEX> from a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.7 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1988</TIMEX> .
     It was n't clear where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> expected to obtain the payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 500 million</NUMEX> , which would be well above the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> pension fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say they plan to provide .
     The realty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> might take on new debt or obtain additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , among other possibilities .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ENAMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">2.8 million acres</NUMEX> of property , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">more than 11 million square feet</NUMEX> of space .
     It also holds <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">nearly 40,000 acres</NUMEX> of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has targeted building on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">5,400 acres</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> area .
     Among those are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">the 1,850 acres</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , including <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">208 acres</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Mission Bay</ENAMEX> area .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> pension fund , which has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 billion</NUMEX> already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments .
     The fund is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> a year .
     Fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific</ENAMEX> , but they were approached with the idea by real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JMB Realty Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roulac</ENAMEX> said , to insulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fund</ENAMEX> from potential liability problems .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> , Part III is scheduled to begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James T. Sherwin</ENAMEX> , have changed considerably .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's ability to convince a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations .
     In an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-count indictment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wayne</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX> with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> in advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's credibility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> case depended heavily on its star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd L. Jefferies</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> who was implicated by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX> , and then pointed the finger at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin </ENAMEX>, takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salim B. Lewis</ENAMEX> and corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Bilzerian</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trials were viewed as previews of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's strength in its cases against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX> 's performance as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> was expected to affect his sentencing .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> 's bellwether role was short-lived .
     The first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trial ended in a mistrial after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Johnson Lowe</ENAMEX> found that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">93 hours</TIMEX> of deliberation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 22</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> found Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> guilty on securities fraud and other charges in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A month later</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX> was spared a jail term by a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> who praised him for helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     In August , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> felony counts .
     Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> directly involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> case .
     The mistrials have left the reputations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Heyman</ENAMEX> in limbo .
     For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin </ENAMEX>, a conviction could carry penalties of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250,000</NUMEX> fine on each count .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> faces potential fines of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> for each count .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the case said that throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> were talking with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in an effort to prevent a trial , but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> the talks had ended .
     There is much speculation among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> not involved that the strategy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Liman</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Kaufman</ENAMEX> , will include testimony by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heyman </ENAMEX>.
     Neither testified at the previous trials .
     For now , defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are tight-lipped about their plans .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Gitter</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GAF</ENAMEX> defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , `` As we go in for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX> 's famous line is apt : ` It 's deja vu all over again . ' ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">DALKON SHIELD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CLAIMANTS</ENAMEX> hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorneys</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 18,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who claim injuries from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Dalkon Shield</ENAMEX> contraceptive device have asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.H. Robins Co.</ENAMEX> , which manufactured the device .
     The dispute pits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> against each other .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael A. Pretl</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,136</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.38 billion</NUMEX> settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan .
     The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> by a dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims .
     It also bars future suits against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robins</ENAMEX> 's former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Co</ENAMEX> .
     The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan B. Morrison </ENAMEX>, a public interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , who is challenging the plan on behalf of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 100,000</NUMEX> claims against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robins</ENAMEX> are pending .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> made and marketed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Dalkon Shield</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robins</ENAMEX> has been in proceedings under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S. Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1985</TIMEX> ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Home Products Corp.</ENAMEX> wants to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robins</ENAMEX> , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted .
     In a brief filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pretl</ENAMEX> criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> is scheduled to consider the case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 3</TIMEX> and may issue a decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as Nov. 6</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">JURY</ENAMEX> 'S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> law is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles A. Donohoo</ENAMEX> , sole proprieter of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky.</ENAMEX> , demolition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , was found guilty of violating the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> law as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Criminal</ENAMEX> convictions under the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case .
     Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time .
     Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say virtually all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">substances</ENAMEX> into the environment .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donohoo</ENAMEX> was convicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last month</TIMEX> of violating <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> by failing to report the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> into the environment from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> he was demolishing .
     He was also convicted of failing to properly remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> sought a criminal penalty because `` no cleanup is possible here .
     Once -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">asbestos</ENAMEX> -RCB- is released into the environment , it can lodge anywhere , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Dennis</ENAMEX> , the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> who prosecuted the case .

     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> could not be reached for comment .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donohoo</ENAMEX> faces <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as much as three years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250,000</NUMEX> fine for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Superfund</ENAMEX> conviction and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as much as one year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> fine for the violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED BUNDY</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">LAWYERS</ENAMEX> switch to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> ' side in death-sentence case .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wilmer , Cutler & Pickering</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 1 million</NUMEX> fighting the execution of mass-murderer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Bundy</ENAMEX> -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , this time on the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> murder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> .
     The law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> , a conservative legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     The key issue in the case , which the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is handling without a fee , or pro bono , is whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Gene Simmons</ENAMEX> , was convicted of killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> on death row has appealed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> 's death sentence in a `` next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> '' capacity .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wilmer Cutler</ENAMEX> 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> who filed the appeal lacks proper standing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.J. Mode</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wilmer Cutler</ENAMEX> 's managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , says the trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that represented Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bundy</ENAMEX> was asked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised .
     The coupling of the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> is odd also , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wilmer Cutler</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> singled out for criticism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> by the conservative legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work .
     `` We give them a lot of credit for taking this case , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">WLF</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Slobodin</ENAMEX> .
     THE CASE OF THE FAKE <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DALIS</ENAMEX> :
     In federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvador Dali</ENAMEX> lithographs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Evans</ENAMEX> , formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barclay Gallery</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence Clark</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barclay</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs .
     The posters were sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,300 to $ 6,000</NUMEX> , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> says they had a value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 53 to $ 200</NUMEX> apiece .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Pitman</ENAMEX> , the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> handling the case , said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> were defrauded and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barclay</ENAMEX> 's total proceeds from the sales were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.4 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorneys</ENAMEX> for Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> said that although their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales , they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> , who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .

     It did n't specify the nature of the differences , saying only that they related to `` management style '' and `` strategic objectives . ''

     Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payne</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> could be reached to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westamerica</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> of assets and is the largest independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> 's resignation surprised many industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     He was brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate Bancorp</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> had been suffering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1987</TIMEX> from a slew of bad real estate loans made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> .
     When he was hired , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payne</ENAMEX> lauded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> 's `` extraordinary ... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the West 's brightest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> . ''
     Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> is n't performing as well as some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> in the lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> market , its condition has improved since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> took over .

     The diversified electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> blamed the decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter ended Sept. 29</TIMEX> , on previously reported operating problems in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Electron Devices & Systems Group</ENAMEX> .

     It said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses .
     It also can sell the right to regain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> .
     Also , the broker-dealer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources Equity Corp.</ENAMEX> , was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Alliance Associates Inc</ENAMEX> .

     Integrated will pump <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 million to $ 4 million</NUMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Alliance</ENAMEX> as initial funding .
     In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krat</ENAMEX> said that based on criteria yet to be determined , he expects to distribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Alliance</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> , who sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> 's insurance and mutual-fund products .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krat</ENAMEX> indicated that completion of the transaction could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several weeks</TIMEX> , and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> is n't expected to be profitable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least one year</TIMEX> .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> regains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , it would receive any profit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> reports , even while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> is independent .
     If the deal closes , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> will draw salaries from the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> , not from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> .

     They noted , however , that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8470 marks</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8578 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.43 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> .
     Sterling was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6030</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5885</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.80</NUMEX> yen , down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.40</NUMEX> yen .
     The market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> gross national product , due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace .
     The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</NUMEX> gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> , but still fairly strong .
     Few market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected .
     Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to come .
     `` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Simon </ENAMEX>, an assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Julius Baer & Co</ENAMEX> .
     `` Yet even a relatively strong number -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 % to 2.9 %</NUMEX> -- wo n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Pedroli</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of foreign exchange at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , adds , `` The market sees this as the last piece of good news . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedroli</ENAMEX> notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> more room to ease key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> rates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> predict a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</NUMEX> rise in the deflator , after climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade gap in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> was reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy was losing its momentum .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock shares compounded the view , they say .
     `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> .
     `` If we 're not headed for a recession , we 're certainly headed for a major slowdown . ''
     While the market expects little reaction from news of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> durable goods orders , scheduled for release <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> .
     The anticipated drop follows a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> , however , are quick to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for buying dollars , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit has found a `` natural bottom '' at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 1.85 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">140 yen</NUMEX> .
     Its resilience around these levels is pegged to persistent investor demand for the greenback , especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .

     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> noted that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> took profits against the backdrop of the Nikkei 's fast-paced recovery following its plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Monday</TIMEX> in reaction to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stock prices .
     But overall buying interest remained strong through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> saying they expect the Nikkei to continue with moderate gains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .

     Limited volume ahead of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> trade data showed the market is nervous , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> added that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's modest gains also signaled some support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> equities .
     They pegged the support largely to anticipation that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers</ENAMEX> said the declines early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> were partly caused by losses of the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Christian-Democratic Union</ENAMEX> in communal elections in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">Baden-Wuerttemberg</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> has made them before , at which point the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> demonstrated they were untrue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . ''
     Since the spill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hours</TIMEX> after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> claims that use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">dispersants</ENAMEX> , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> banned their use during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the two days</TIMEX> of fair weather following the spill .
     The oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> claims that it had permission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> prior to the spill to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">dispersant</ENAMEX> during such an incident at the discretion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's opposition to the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">dispersants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> says , caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> `` to delay granting permission . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first two days</TIMEX> following the spill showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">dispersant</ENAMEX> was n't working anyway .
     Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">dispersants</ENAMEX> was approved when a test on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third day</TIMEX> showed some positive results , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> in emergency funding to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's recovery from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake and to extend further aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     The package was termed excessive by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , but it also provoked a struggle with influential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> who sought unsuccessfully to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 billion</NUMEX> more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds .
     By a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> margin , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Miss .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> 's largest state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     `` I have no regrets about going forward , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vic Fazio</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting .
     `` We are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Golden State</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> package incorporates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> for small-business loans , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in highway construction funds , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.35 billion</NUMEX> divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
     The funding is attached to a stopgap bill to keep most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> operating through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> .
     The measure is expected to come before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is under pressure to complete action before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight EDT</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , when the current continuing resolution expires .
     Given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's size and political importance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> is eager to appear generous .
     But in private meetings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Budget</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> argued that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> in new federal appropriations are needed to supplement existing resources .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> budget office analysis estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> -- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's needs , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> .
     `` Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we 've got to address it , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> , who came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol</ENAMEX> to meet with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> before the committee session .
     `` I would hope very much that we would n't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat . ''
     Although this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> pressure was clearly a factor among committee <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> , no single influence was greater than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten </ENAMEX>.
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> offered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX>-backed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.84 billion</NUMEX> plan , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> insisted that the full <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> pages be read aloud by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's motion , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> pointedly opposed it .
     More important than money in many cases are waivers <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds , such as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> cap on how much any single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> can receive in emergency funds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten </ENAMEX>'s package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next six months</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> nonetheless found himself burdened not only by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's needs but by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of private beaches in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> , and lumber interests sought to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">another $ 100 million</NUMEX> in federal aid to plant timber on private land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North and South Carolina</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position , too .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> provision last night would have raised the cap on disaster loans to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> per household to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> losses .
