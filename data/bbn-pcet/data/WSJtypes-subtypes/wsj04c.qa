     An ancient red-figured <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> kylix , or drinking cup , was recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">backstage</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this spring</TIMEX> and has been returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> who lost it in a burglary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Guy</ENAMEX> , an associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Princeton Art Museum</ENAMEX> , was previewing a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> antiquities sale at the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> when he recognized the kylix , which he , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Attic</ENAMEX> pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IFAR Reports</ENAMEX> , '' knew was stolen .
     The timing of his visit was fortuitous ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hall</ENAMEX> .
     To confirm Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy</ENAMEX> 's identification , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IFAR</ENAMEX> exchanged photos by fax , and the waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen , agreed to release it .
     The cup had been insured , and in short order it was given over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chubb & Son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> .
     The original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home .
     A former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Museum of Cartoon Art</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rye Brook</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , pleaded guilty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips , among them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Tracy</ENAMEX> strips by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chester Gould</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Valiant</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> cartoons by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hal Foster</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> animation celluloids , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Hammond</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     He sold them well below market value to raise cash `` to pay off mounting credit-card debts , '' incurred to buy presents for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Russell</ENAMEX> , told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IFAR</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">27-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman Krisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , had worked his way up from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">janitor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> .
     The theft was discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year</TIMEX> , soon after Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> took her post .
     Sentencing was postponed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 18</TIMEX> , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krisher</ENAMEX> was hospitalized for depression .
     His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> .
     But on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 6</TIMEX> , he had reason to celebrate .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Two days earlier</TIMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> met in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Park Avenue</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> with a cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> who expected to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> of the most important stolen strips to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62,800</NUMEX> .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> seized the stolen goods , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krisher</ENAMEX> avoided jail .
     He was sentenced to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 hours</TIMEX> of community service and restitution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45,000</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authorities</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Heathrow Airport</ENAMEX> are investigating the disappearance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gauguin</ENAMEX> watercolor , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo</ENAMEX> , '' that has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sketches on its verso -LRB- opposite -RRB- side .
     Valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 million</NUMEX> , it was part of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-crate shipment .
     The air-waybill number was changed en route , and paper work showing that the crates had cleared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">customs</ENAMEX> was misplaced , so it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> crates could be located in a bonded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">warehouse</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX> discovered missing .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Heathrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have been watching a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of allegedly crooked baggage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handlers</ENAMEX> for some time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX> may be `` lost .

''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">University of Virginia Art Museum</ENAMEX> certainly would agree .
     Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> had purchased an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Attic</ENAMEX> black-figured column krater and shipped it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     It was reported stolen in transit en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Months later</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> vase arrived in good condition at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlottesville</ENAMEX> , having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nairobi</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> , not professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art thieves</ENAMEX> , have been arrested for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985 Christmas Eve</TIMEX> burglary from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">National Museum of Anthropology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mexico City</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mixtec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Zapotec</ENAMEX> objects , including some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's best-known archaeological treasures , were taken .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> offered a reward for the return of the antiquities , but routine police work led to the recovery .
     As it turned out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Perches Trevino</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramon Sardina Garcia</ENAMEX> had hidden the haul in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">closet</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perches</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     Then they took the art to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Acapulco</ENAMEX> and began to trade some of it for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cocaine</ENAMEX> .
     Information from an arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trafficker</ENAMEX> led to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and the recovery of almost all the stolen art .
     Among other happy news bulletins from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> announced that it has recovered `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Cemetery in the Snow</ENAMEX> , '' a painting by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caspar David Friedrich</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> 's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> notified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IFAR</ENAMEX> of the theft in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1988</TIMEX> .
     According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Europe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">desk</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previously convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX> were charged , tried , convicted and sentenced to prison terms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four and 12 years</TIMEX> .
     The precious canvas , cut from its frame at the time of the theft , was found in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jena</ENAMEX> , hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> .
     No charges were brought against her .
     Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lawrence Trotter</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">35</TIMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kennett Square</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , took his fooling seriously .
     He painted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> himself in the style of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Haberle</ENAMEX> and sold it as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> original to antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Woodbridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trotter</ENAMEX> 's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle ; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes , folded , faded and crumpled papers and currency .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trotter</ENAMEX> 's fake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haberle</ENAMEX> was offered at a bargain price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25,000</NUMEX> with a phony story that it belonged to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> 's late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Canaan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> immediately showed their new acquisition to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> and came to see it as a fake .
     They persuaded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trotter</ENAMEX> to take it back and , with the help of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> , taped their conversation with him .
     After his arrest , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forger</ENAMEX> admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard .

     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> said they are recalling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 88,500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX>-model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Tracers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">323s</ENAMEX> equipped with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">1.6-liter</NUMEX> fuel-injected engines to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> filler cap .

     As a result of the adhesive problem on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Escort</ENAMEX> subcompacts , windshields may easily separate from the car during frontal impact , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> said .
     When properly applied , the adhesive is designed to retain the windshield in place in a crash test at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">30 miles per hour</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dearborn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> is n't aware of any injuries caused by the windshield problem .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Tracers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">323s</ENAMEX> to deteriorate more rapidly than normal , causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life .
     They said the problems are n't safety related .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> filler cap with a ventilated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> filler cap .

     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> who have followed the recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> maintenance schedule , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> will extend to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">60,000 miles</NUMEX> the warranty term for engine damage due to abnormal engine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> deterioration .
     The normal term for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">323</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">24,000 miles</NUMEX> ; the term for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">323</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">50,000 miles</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> agreed to decide whether the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.</ENAMEX> may require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Corp.</ENAMEX> to reassume funding responsibility for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.3 billion</NUMEX> shortfall in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's pension plans .
     The high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's decision , expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> , may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , which is funded through insurance premiums from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> , insures pension benefits for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 30 million</NUMEX> private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who take part in single-employer pension plans .
     It recently reported assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</NUMEX> and liabilities of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> .
     In its appeal to the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> said the federal appeals court ruling , which favored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> , threatened to transform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> of troubled pension plans into an `` open-ended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">source</ENAMEX> of industry bailouts . ''
     The ruling also may determine how quickly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> is able to complete its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> reorganization .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> filed for protection under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> in federal bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     The filing was partly the result of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.3 billion</NUMEX> shortfall in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pension plans operated for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Steel Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1987</TIMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Steel</ENAMEX> continued operating while under reorganization , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> terminated the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing .
     Termination means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> do n't accrue new benefits .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few months later</TIMEX> , under pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Steelworkers of America</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans .
     Because the federal pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> had taken over the old plans , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.3 billion</NUMEX> shortfall from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> to federal insurance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> also concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1987</TIMEX> , it ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> to reassume liability and funding for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> original plans .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> challenged the order , and a federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1988</TIMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> improperly ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> to reassume responsibility for the plans .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , a federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> agreed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> acted unlawfully .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> said there was no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to allow the pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> to consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to reassume liability for old plans .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> also said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> had to consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's long-term ability to fund pension plans , not just short-term improved financial status .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> said that it was disappointed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> proceedings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV</ENAMEX> , a steel , aerospace and energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , said it is confident that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> about a settlement while the case is being reviewed .

     The commercial was absolutely silent .
     Breaking into the raucous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Bears</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cleveland Browns</ENAMEX> match during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> game , it was nothing but simple block letters superimposed on the TV screen .
     `` Due to the earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is donating its commercial air time to broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Red Cross</ENAMEX> Emergency Relief messages .
     Please contribute what you can , '' the ad said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> logo flashed on the screen for a moment , and then came a taped plea for donations from former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> -- followed by the silent print telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> where to call .

     Call it disaster marketing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor</ENAMEX> is just one of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">slew</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> that have hitched their ads to the devastating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     Sometimes , the ads attempt to raise money ; always , they try to boost good will .
     By advertising disaster relief , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are hoping to don a white hat and come out a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hero</ENAMEX> .
     But the strategy can backfire ; if the ads appear too self-serving , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> may end up looking like rank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">opportunists</ENAMEX> instead of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Samaritans</ENAMEX> .
     That has n't deterred plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Life Insurance</ENAMEX> have tied ads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Red Cross</ENAMEX> donations .
     Other ads do n't bother with the fundraising ; a touching , if self-congratulatory , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> ad that aired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> intermixed footage of the devastation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charleston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C.</ENAMEX> , with interviews of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> recounting how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> helped . At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , `` we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">money</NUMEX> , and we had this airtime on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> , '' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke Mitzel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> advertising creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     `` What did we get out of it ?
     We got some exposure ... and pretty much good will . ''
     The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw .
     While TV commercials typically take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> to produce , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX> have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> or even <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> .
     The big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> learned the art of the instant commercial after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , when they turned out reassuring ads inviting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> right back into the stock market .
     They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> created its quake ad in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> latch onto disasters with increasing frequency , they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause .
     They chance alienating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks . `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> see extra messages in advertising , and if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> is clearly trying to get something out of it ... if it 's too transparent ... then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> will see through that , '' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Philip Jones</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Newhouse School of Public Communications</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Syracuse University</ENAMEX> .
     `` It can backfire because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can step across the line and go too far , be too pushy , '' agrees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Stibel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New England Consulting Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Westport</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn .</ENAMEX>
     `` The ultimate form of charity is when you do n't tell anyone . ''
     Still , he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been `` tasteless '' and that `` the majority have been truly beneficial to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who need the help .
     We do n't consider that ambulance chasing . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> running the disaster ads certainly do n't see themselves as ambulance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chasers</ENAMEX> , either .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Gibbons</ENAMEX> , stars in ads saying that the fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> will donate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> for every purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Doubles</ENAMEX> hamburger .
     The campaign , which started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> and runs through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 23</TIMEX> , with funds earmarked for both the quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> , `` was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> 's idea , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> says .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> felt very committed .
     He felt we should be giving something back . ''
     While the campaign was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibbons</ENAMEX> 's idea , however , he wo n't be paying for it : The donations will come out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> 's national advertising fund , which is financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> .
     And by basing donations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Doubles</ENAMEX> , a new double-hamburger line the fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> is trying to push , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> works a sales pitch into its public-service message .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> , also put in a plug for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> donations in a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> game it sponsored .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> is brought to you by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> , who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake ... , '' the game <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> said .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Life</ENAMEX> made a plea for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> donations in newspaper ads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area , latching onto the coattails of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> 's impeccable reputation : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> has been helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">125 years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Life</ENAMEX> has been doing the same for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">over 140 years</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Craig</ENAMEX> , advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> , readily admits `` they 're piggybacking on our reputation . ''

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> let stand a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's ruling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of an individual dose is unknown .
     The high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's action , refusing to hear appeals by several drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , is likely to have a significant impact at several levels .
     The most immediate effect is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , where former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of the anti-miscarriage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> -- the synthetic female <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">diethylstilbestrol</ENAMEX> -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> lawsuits pending in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     The lawsuits stemmed from the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and other problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who took the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> .
     On a broader scale , the ruling could encourage other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> to adopt the logic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> cases but in other product-related lawsuits , as well .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">New York Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> ruling parallels a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Supreme Court</ENAMEX> requiring shared liability among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> for injuries when it ca n't be determined which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is at fault .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rheingold</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who represents <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , said that before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> ruling , only the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> had followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> decision .
     Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> decision has been left intact , other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> may follow suit .
     `` Generally , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> go one way , it has a tremendous influence on other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , especially small ones , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rheingold</ENAMEX> .
     The high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> refused to hear appeals by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rexall Drug Co.</ENAMEX> , which went out of business in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and was taken over by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RXDC Liquidating Trust</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Squibb Corp.</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly & Co .</ENAMEX>
     The appeals involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> , which was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> for use from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> banned the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> after studies linked it to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and other problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who took the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> .
     Lawsuits over the harm caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> have flooded federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> .
     In many cases , the lawsuit was filed long after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> was used -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> was typically not detected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> -- and there is no way to prove which of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> manufactured the doses consumed by certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     Under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> manufactured a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed .
     But in its ruling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> said that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> of the anti-miscarriage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> should share liability when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of a specific dose ca n't be determined .
     Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> also upheld a state law , passed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , extending for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> the statute of limitations on filing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> lawsuits .
     The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> extension .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">high court</ENAMEX> , leaving intact a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25 million</NUMEX> damage award against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics Corp.</ENAMEX> , declined to resolve questions about a legal defense against civil lawsuits often used by government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> defined when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , such as military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> , may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract .
     In that decision , the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> must prove that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last February</TIMEX> , a federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Orleans</ENAMEX> upheld a damage award against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> , rejecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's use of the government contractor defense .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> said the defense is valid only if federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> did more than rubber stamp a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> appealed to the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , backed by numerous business trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , arguing that the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> definition restricts the defense too severely .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> was sued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> who were killed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> after they re-entered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">submarine</ENAMEX> through a diving chamber .

     It can be hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX> will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> .
     A strong challenge from the far left , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Izquierda Unida</ENAMEX> , failed to topple him .
     He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left .
     If he follows the correct path , he may be able to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition .
     The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them .
     It could point to plenty of ailments that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure .
     Unemployment still is officially recorded at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.5 %</NUMEX> , the highest rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , although actual joblessness may be lower .
     Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> , mail service , telephone network and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> -- are in disgraceful condition .
     Large pockets of poverty still exist .
     The left also is critical of the style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , particularly the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Solchaga</ENAMEX> , are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elitists</ENAMEX> who refuse even to go on television -LRB- controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> -RRB- to face their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accusers</ENAMEX> .
     In response to this , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Socialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> has simply cited his free-market accomplishments .
     They are very considerable : Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> , its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> -- the fastest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> .
     In that time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.2 million</NUMEX> jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 %</NUMEX> .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> inflation rate dropped below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> .
     Net foreign investment through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> has been running at a pace of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.5 billion</NUMEX> , about double the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> rate .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> also has split with the left in reaffirming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NATO</ENAMEX> commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is not quite a closet supply-side <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> , however .
     He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes .
     Yet the best the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40 %</NUMEX> -- from endorsing the direction <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> is taking .
     Now he can go further .
     He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
     He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> delivered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> mandate for his successes .
     They , as well as numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> that hope to adopt elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> model , are supporting the direction <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> is taking .
     It would be sad for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> to abandon them to appease his foes .

     Oh , that terrible Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> .
     Just when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> , along comes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> to `` blunder '' into the hands of what are often called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> are the faction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> politics which always said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> do n't want to hold an election in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> are the faction that says , Give peace a chance ; now they are saying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> should give them a break , lest the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages .
     We suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy .
     He knows that making <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> look silly in a photograph with him will trigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriegan</ENAMEX> fulminations , and that announcing an end to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> ' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> ' military activities in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> movement is not democratic peace , but nondemocratic unpeace .
     It is the presence of internal and external `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> '' which justifies the need for a large , active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> continues to supply with bullets .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> believe is the main vehicle used by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traffickers</ENAMEX> to move <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     In recent testimony on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they were considering the new reporting requirements , and the expected publication of the proposal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Register</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> official step toward creating final regulations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> is still working out the details with bank trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">associations</ENAMEX> and the other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> that have a hand in fighting money laundering .
     Among the possibilities the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> is considering are requirements that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> keep records identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">originators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> of international wire transfers .
     Another suggestion would draw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> more directly into tracking down <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money launderers</ENAMEX> by developing a `` suspicious international wire transfer profile , '' which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> would use to spotlight questionable payments .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions , rather than a blanket reporting requirement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> or more .
     But wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> -- are n't reported .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> believe this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are exploiting .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it had filed a request with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield `` junk '' bonds , declined to say what alternatives are under consideration .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> notes expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to propose a more-attractive debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> has had major losses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone awry .
     The major question , said one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> who asked not to be named , is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett S. LeBow</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brooke Partners</ENAMEX> controls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> , is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to entice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> into agreeing to a new swap .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> in notes , the largest chunk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 640 million</NUMEX> in long-term debt , stems from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's major restructuring in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1987</TIMEX> .
     The notes became burdensome when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.25 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> had offered to swap each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount of the notes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> shares of common stock and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new debt issues : a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> note paying an interest rate starting at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.75 %</NUMEX> annually and rising in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later years</TIMEX> , due in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> note , due in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> , paying a fixed rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> and including rights protecting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> against a decline in the trading price of the bond .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> must make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48 million</NUMEX> in interest payments on the reset notes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 15</TIMEX> , and a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said it fully intends to meet the payments .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> has said it must lower the interest rate on its debt to regain full financial health .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> in the over-the-counter market dumped banking and insurance issues , sending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite index lower for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> consecutive session .
     All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> industry indexes finished lower , with financial issues hit the hardest .
     Despite some early computer-guided program buying , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.39</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">451.37</NUMEX> .
     The OTC market now has declined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> sessions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> bank index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.00</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">432.61</NUMEX> , while the insurance index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.56</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">528.56</NUMEX> , and the `` other finance '' index dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.27</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">529.32</NUMEX> .
     The largest financial issues , as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> financial index , tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.23</NUMEX> to
     Meanwhile , the index of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> biggest non-financial stocks , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 100 , gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.47</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">438.15</NUMEX> .
     Profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in OTC stock prices , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mills</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Company Advisers</ENAMEX> .
     He said many portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> bonuses are tied to annual performance , are selling now rather than risk seeing their gains erode further .
     `` The profit locking-in is definitely going on , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 600 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Co .</ENAMEX>
     Tax-loss <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> , those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who sell loss-making stocks so they can deduct their losses from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's income , are also getting out , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> said .
     That 's helping put pressure on both the market 's winners and its losers .
     `` The stocks that have been the best are having big pullbacks , and the ones that have been the worst are getting clobbered , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> said .
     He expects the market to sink further and to reach a low sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> or in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     The selling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money managers</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> is turning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> bearish as well .
     `` We are advising a lot of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to make moves that make sense to them , rather than waiting until the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last minute</TIMEX> , because things have been so volatile , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sulya</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.G.

     Much of the market 's recent volatility has been blamed on this large-scale computerized trading technique that can send stock prices surging or plummeting in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> .
     The problem has been particularly damaging to the OTC market , traditionally a base for the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> .

     The stock jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 1\/2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> announced it was in takeover talks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ratners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weisfield 's</ENAMEX> said they expect to sign definitive agreements shortly and to complete the transaction by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 15</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> said the talks resulted from solicitations by its financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">adviser</ENAMEX> .

     The loss was largely due to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55.2 million</NUMEX> addition to reserves .

     Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are starting to uncover a handful of genes which , if damaged , unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> say the discovery of these genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> is painting a new and startling picture of how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> develops .
     An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> treatment and prevention .
     That is for the future .
     Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that , for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is likely to get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Vogelstein</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only a decade ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> was a black <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">box</ENAMEX> about which we knew nothing at the molecular level .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and , then , propel it into a deadly state . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes .
     When functioning normally , they make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> that hold a cell 's growth in check .
     But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant .
     The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> called oncogenes .
     Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by themselves .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged .
     Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> .
     Either copy can make the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> needed to control cell growth , so for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to arise , both copies must be impaired .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is born with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> because he need only lose the other copy for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to develop .
     Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> , ushering in what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> believe is a new age of predictive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie Quinlan</ENAMEX> are among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of the new findings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dedham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> knew even before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie</ENAMEX> became pregnant in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of theirs had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> chance of being at risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> , an eye <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> that occurs about once every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> births .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">30 years old</TIMEX> , knew he carried a damaged gene , having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">only two months old</TIMEX> -- after his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had suffered the same fate when she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> .
     Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene , it became possible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last January</TIMEX> to find out what threat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> faced .
     A test using new `` genetic probes '' showed that little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Quinlan</ENAMEX> had not inherited a damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of developing the rare <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     `` It made our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">New Year</TIMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> .
     This test was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to predict reliably whether an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> could expect to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thaddeus Dryja</ENAMEX> , has opened a field of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> study , which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> has exploded .
     `` It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Broder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> .
     `` All this may not be obvious to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> , which is concerned about advances in treatment , but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon . ''
     To date , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have fingered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-suppressors .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryja</ENAMEX> made his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> discovery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     Then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous .
     Soon after that report , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> .
     Colon , lung and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> are the most common and lethal forms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> , collectively killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> a year .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Right now</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">laboratories</ENAMEX> , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes .
     They have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about seven</NUMEX> candidates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix .
     There is evidence that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , perhaps explaining , finally , why some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> seem to haunt certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970s</TIMEX> , when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pediatrician</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred G. Knudson Jr.</ENAMEX> proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> stemmed from two separate genetic defects .
     He theorized that in the eye <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and a normal copy from the other .
     The tumor , he suggested , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged .
     But there was no way to prove <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> 's `` two-hit '' theory .
     Back then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes .
     Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> found that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with the eye <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> who had had the disease .
     Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> was missing .
     He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared .
     Then , a scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> led by molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster Cavenee</ENAMEX> , then at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Utah</ENAMEX> , found the answer .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell .
     By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> in the exact area as in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> copy of the chromosome .
     The finding riveted medicine .
     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     `` It was extraordinarily satisfying , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Fox Chase Cancer Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
     `` I was convinced that what was true of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> would be true for all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> . ''
     It was an audacious claim .
     But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> , a young molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Johns Hopkins Medical School</ENAMEX> , believed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> was right , and set out to repeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cavenee</ENAMEX> experiment in cells from other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> .
     His was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> of the kidney called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Wilm 's tumor</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> next turned his attention to colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> biggest cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">killer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> after lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     He believed colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages .
     It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> and a doctoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Fearon</ENAMEX> , began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">months</TIMEX> of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .
     They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .
     Gradually , a coherent picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> development emerged .
     If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , benign polyps would develop .
     If both copies of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gene were then deleted , the polyps would progress to malignancy .
     It was clear that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> gene had to be damaged for colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to develop .
     Their report galvanized other molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> . `` It was the confirming evidence we all needed that -LCB- gene -RCB- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray White</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy .
     They focused on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> .
     For months the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells .
     Such a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> would probably constitute a gene .
     When they found it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last winter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> was dubious that the search was over .
     His doubts stemmed from the fact that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years earlier</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Princeton University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Levine</ENAMEX> , had found in experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones .
     The deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> found was in exactly the same spot as p53 .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> had said the p53 gene caused <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by promoting growth , whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> were looking for a gene that suppressed growth .
     Despite that , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> 's p53 gene they found the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene .
     The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> formation , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Weinberg</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in cancer-gene research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Whitehead Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass .</ENAMEX>
     Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> , too .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Edinburgh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Scotland</ENAMEX> , have found that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> breast tumors , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> say that since breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> often strikes multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     In a report out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Minna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> say that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .
     There also are reports from several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">labs</ENAMEX> , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogelstein</ENAMEX> hopes soon to isolate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> , also involved in colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray White</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Bodmer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain</ENAMEX> , are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , thought to be on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minna</ENAMEX> believes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who inherit a defective gene somewhere on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> are especially prone to lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     Recently , he and others reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> , as well as several other more common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> , too .
     Where these discoveries will lead , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> can only speculate .
     Already <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Squibb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.</ENAMEX> , are collaborating with gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> say new cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes .
     The idea would be to administer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the growth-controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> made by healthy versions of the damaged genes .
     It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far .
     In any case , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minna</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .

     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael Foods</ENAMEX> about as much chance of getting it together as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humpty Dumpty</ENAMEX> .
     But now at least there 's a glimmer of hope for the stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> , which breaks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> , is quietly switching over to an alternative egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">product</ENAMEX> made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael Foods</ENAMEX> .
     Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Easy Eggs</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">product</ENAMEX> has disappointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> announced lower-than-forecast sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Easy Eggs</ENAMEX> , the stock dropped nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael</ENAMEX> wo n't confirm the identities of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Easy Egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , nor will it say much of anything else .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> shareholder suits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past month</TIMEX> have accused top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of making `` various untrue statements . ''
     These federal-court suits accuse the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of failing to disclose that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Easy Eggs</ENAMEX> were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael</ENAMEX> 's production capacity .
     But at least <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> has signed on , and says that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> it wo n't be using any shell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> , owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand Metropolitan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , expects to consume <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">roughly 34 million pounds</NUMEX> of liquefied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> .
     So there is reason to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael</ENAMEX> 's hopes for a bacteria-free , long-shelf-life <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> were n't all hype .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Easy Eggs</ENAMEX> are pasteurized in a heat-using process . -RRB-
     Still , caution is advisable .
     A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> 's break-even volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Easy Eggs</ENAMEX> is around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 million pounds</NUMEX> a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> once suggested was a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion-pound</NUMEX> market waiting for such a product .
     Perhaps to debunk the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' talk of over-capacity , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> will take some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> on a tour of its new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Gaylord</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">plant</ENAMEX> .
     There has been no announcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> arrangement by either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> , possibly for fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> and other fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> would seize on it in scornful advertising .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> independently confirm using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael</ENAMEX> 's product .
     Other institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">users</ENAMEX> reportedly include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> , which is moving away from fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> on a region-by-region basis .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Michael Foods</ENAMEX> has attracted a good many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short-sellers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lender</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> question <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> 's credibility . `` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but -LCB- because -RCB- the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> printing , publishing and forest-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>-owned by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> , agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Graphics Inc.</ENAMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> in cash and securities .
     The purchase , expected to be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> , will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> the second-largest commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">printer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> , behind only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     The printing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> will gain through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Graphics</ENAMEX> include the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> newspaper supplement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Parade</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sports Illustrated</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TV Guide</ENAMEX> .
     But the transaction is just Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> 's latest step in a larger design : to build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> through acquisitions into an integrated paper , publishing and printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> with a reach throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> .
     He already has achieved vertical integration on a limited scale : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> can put a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> newspaper on almost any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> doorstep without using outside help , from chopping down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> to making the newsprint to flinging it up onto the porch .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> 's purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> printing industry .
     Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donnelley</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Massicotte</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> has positioned itself as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> . ''
     He adds : `` I think this is a great strategic move for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> .
     They are buying an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> that is running well . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> says he is n't trying to catch up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donnelley</ENAMEX> , which has annual sales of over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     `` Size does n't matter , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> says .
     `` What counts is the bottom line . ''
     Some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> 's ventures , including an earlier push into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , have n't paid off on the bottom line .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> started the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philadelphia Journal</ENAMEX> , a daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tabloid</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> and closed it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years later</TIMEX> .
     The venture cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 million</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> says .
     More recently , some former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> started their own printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , specializing in printing and distributing advertising circulars .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> still lags in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> circulars market , while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> 's former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are expanding across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> took his first big gamble <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">25 years ago</TIMEX> , when he took advantage of a strike at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">La Presse</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> 's dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French-language</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> , to launch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal de Montreal</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tabloid</ENAMEX> 's circulation soared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</NUMEX> , but plunged to under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">La Presse</ENAMEX> strike ended .
     Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> stuck with the venture .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Now</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , flush with ads and hugely profitable , is even with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">La Presse</ENAMEX> in weekend circulation and outsells it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every weekday</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peladeau</ENAMEX> has never made any apologies for publishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tabloid</ENAMEX> , a brash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mix</ENAMEX> of crime and sports .
     `` I 've read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balzac</ENAMEX> , '' he answers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's tabloid news from A to Z . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> also publishes a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tabloid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> , the struggling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Montreal Daily News</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dailies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Quebec City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Winnipeg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">weeklies</ENAMEX> covering most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> .
     A series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> .
     After a recent merger , it is also the only province-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> .
     Finally , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> controls <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donohue Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Quebec City</ENAMEX> pulp and paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's accord , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> agreed to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> in cash for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Graphics</ENAMEX> , and to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake , valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> 's new printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> .
     The new , as yet unnamed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> will combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> 's existing printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Graphics</ENAMEX> .
     It will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> from coast to coast and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> in annual sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> will own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.5 %</NUMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caisse de Depot et Placement</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Quebec</ENAMEX> government pension-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 112.5 million</NUMEX> for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.5 %</NUMEX> stake in the printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre-Karl Peladeau</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> in charge of the acquisition , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> has n't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase , but he says it most likely will use debt .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell</ENAMEX> deal is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> 's second big printing acquisition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">just over a year</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last October</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> printing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BCE Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> telecommunications , manufacturing , energy and real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     That purchase doubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> 's annual printing revenue to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell</ENAMEX> 's sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> was expected , the last major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> to be disposed of in a major reshuffling of assets .
     According to its most recent annual report , covering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 15 months ended March 31</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> bought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.85 billion</NUMEX> in assets -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Official Airlines Guides</ENAMEX> -- and sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> in non-strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell</ENAMEX> says he has an appetite for new acquisitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , adding that he could spend `` a good deal more '' than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> on another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> purchase .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> shares rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine pence</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">216 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.41</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quebecor</ENAMEX> 's multiple voting Class A stock closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 16.375</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 13.94</NUMEX> -RRB- , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 Canadian cents</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> for age discrimination against appointed state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> .
     The suit , filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> 's mandatory retirement age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">76</TIMEX> violates federal law .
     Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> intervened in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's age-bias suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">federal court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Haven</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> 's filing in that case challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> 's mandatory retirement age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">70</TIMEX> for appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> suit was filed on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Rubin</ENAMEX> , whose appointment to the state appellate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> expires at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> , and all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> hurt by the alleged age discrimination .
     The suit , assigned to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimba Wood</ENAMEX> , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> 's -RRB- unlawful employment practices . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> , a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1969</TIMEX> , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> still capable of serving on the bench .
     `` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number .
     The issue is one of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> said .

     The suit 's impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> may be narrow , however . Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> are elected , and the federal age-discrimination law does n't apply to elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James L.

     Under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> law , elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> must retire at age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">70</TIMEX> , but then can be appointed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> terms until they reach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">76</TIMEX> .

     But she said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> currently has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who are over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">70</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> , however , most state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> are appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and approved by the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EEOC</ENAMEX> age-bias case against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> case , a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's mandatory age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">70</TIMEX> for appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> was illegal ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> 's appeal of that decision is pending before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .

     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trial referees</ENAMEX> , '' who are former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 70</TIMEX> and serve a restricted role on the bench .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> are autonomous from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> announced his plan to abolish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> .
     He says the strike-force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will work more efficiently under the supervision of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> will be free to disband the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">strike forces</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> approves a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 479 million</NUMEX> appropriation for federal law-enforcement and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX>-interdiction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     The bill is expected to pass in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> temporarily halted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> 's effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> 's plan will needlessly break up longtime , tightly knit crime-fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> that have successfully prosecuted major organized-crime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> .
     They predict that organized-crime activity will increase once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> .
     Some former strike-force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> have already begun to break up .

     Although settlement talks had been dropped , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sides apparently began talking again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in an attempt to settle the matter before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> is expected to rule on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's request for an injunction that would block the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> from taking over the management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , in documents filed in connection with that case , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of falsely claiming that they never read the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> contract requiring the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to make movies exclusively for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> , citing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filings made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> that described the contracts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> was referring to documents filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp. of America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Schulof</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , said they had taken Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> at their word when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement .

''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said statements about the contract made in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> filings were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who did have access to the contracts but who were n't part of the negotiations between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sides had an oral agreement that enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to terminate their contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> should the opportunity to run a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> come up .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> from taking executive posts at another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> described as `` nonsense '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 's assertions in prior court filings that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> could in theory run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> .
     Such a dual role would be `` impractical and unethical , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> said , adding , `` that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Dodgers</ENAMEX> could simultaneously be general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit leaped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</NUMEX> , but Wall Street 's attention was focused on the picket line , not the bottom line .
     In fact , the earnings report unfolded as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the world 's No. 1 jet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> and the striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> came back to the negotiating table for their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Hammond</ENAMEX> , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is based , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> will continue to sit down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again .
     Despite the progress , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> indicated that the work stoppage , now in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its 27th day</TIMEX> , will have `` a serious adverse impact '' on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current quarter</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , net rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 242 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.05</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 144 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">63 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.36 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.72 billion</NUMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airliners</ENAMEX> .
     Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> rank and file will last , the precise impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined .
     The investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> or its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> stood at a mighty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 69.1 billion</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.6 billion</NUMEX> at the end of
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> could see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> revenue shrink by nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> if it is n't able to deliver any more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , those <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> actually would just be deferred until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is certain to get out some aircraft with just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> and other non-striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on hand .
     Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> rejected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 4</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> had been counting on turning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> out the door in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the present period</TIMEX> .
     That included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747-400</ENAMEX> jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jets</ENAMEX> , its most successful product . `` It 's not a pretty picture , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Smith</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Raymond James & Associates</ENAMEX> .

     But the strike has n't gone on long enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> to lose business in any real sense . ''
     That 's the primary reason the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's share price has held up so well when , in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> 's words , `` most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would have unraveled '' by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">now</TIMEX> .

     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside .
     In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Shrontz</ENAMEX> asserted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> `` faces significant challenges and risks , '' on both its commercial and government contracts .
     For instance , he noted that spending on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> programs is shrinking , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is either the prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> or a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> on many important military projects , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">B-2 Stealth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bomber</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">V-22 Osprey</ENAMEX> tilt-rotor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> 's next-generation tactical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fighter</ENAMEX> .
     Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> will record `` a significant loss '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> added , production-rate increases that have been implemented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">737</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">757</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767</ENAMEX> programs have resulted in `` serious work force skill-dilution problems . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Suppliers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subcontractors</ENAMEX> are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules .
     And , of course , there 's the unsteady labor situation .
     Besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> pact , accords representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's engineering and technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Puget Sound</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wichita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan.</ENAMEX> , areas expire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early December</TIMEX> .
     Also , a contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Auto Workers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> expired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 15</TIMEX> .
     This contract , covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> production and maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , is being extended on a day-to-day basis .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Machinists</ENAMEX> rejected a proposal featuring a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> base wage increase over the life of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> contract , plus bonuses of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">the second</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reiterated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that it 's willing to reconfigure the package , but not add to the substance of it .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 's net increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 598 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.60</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 440 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.92</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.43 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.09 billion</NUMEX> .
     In a separate matter , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> agreed to pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> to settle claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> provided inaccurate cost information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">KC-135</ENAMEX> tanker <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> .
     The settlement relates to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> contracts negotiated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> said .
     They added that the settlement is the culmination of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2-year</TIMEX> investigation into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's aluminum pricing practices in connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">KC-135s</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> responded : `` All along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution .

     `` This is a pre-emptive strike by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Hillary</ENAMEX> , natural gas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calgary</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Independent Petroleum Association of Canada</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> wants to make it clear to other pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that it 's on first insofar as transporting gas from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Arctic</ENAMEX> to southern markets , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> rival applications are expected to emerge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months</TIMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's largest natural gas pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Dutch\/Shell Group</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Esso Resources Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Oil Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     `` The -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Energy Board</ENAMEX> -RCB- approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage , the rush to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> to transport the gas , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Koerner</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brady & Berliner</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .

     A number of issues still need to be resolved before <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> give any project the final go-ahead .
     First , the price of natural gas will have to almost double .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Jesperson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 3.25</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">a thousand cubic feet</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> , in current <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> , up from a current spot price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about US$ 1.50</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesperson</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 3.25</NUMEX> estimate is somewhat below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.39</NUMEX> floor price that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calgary</ENAMEX>-based consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paul Ziff & Co.</ENAMEX> recently said would be needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> delta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gas producers</ENAMEX> to see a return on their investment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gas buyers</ENAMEX> must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> delta gas or develop <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> reserves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> area first , a project that has been on hold for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than a decade</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pierce</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> , said it 's too early to say whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> delta gas would flow to market first .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line , the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System further north toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> .
     If that option is favored by gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Mackenzie Delta</ENAMEX> reserves to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> mainline .
     It 's also likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> before undertaking any hearings into rival projects .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Stoneman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Canada</ENAMEX> , noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial Pipe Line Co.</ENAMEX> , an oil pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own , said that is n't in the cards .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Haskayne</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Calgary</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interhome Energy Inc.</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would prefer to work with other `` interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> '' on a joint proposal .
     As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Foothills</ENAMEX> ' pre-emptive bid , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haskayne</ENAMEX> said , `` If they think it gives them some kind of priority position , well , that 's their strategy .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> said it is delaying approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union Corp.</ENAMEX> 's proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 849 million</NUMEX> acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida National Banks of Florida Inc.</ENAMEX> , pending the outcome of an examination into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> 's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods .
     The decision reflects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's tougher stance on enforcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act</ENAMEX> , a federal law passed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> to help low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> obtain loans .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> and community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> have won big commitments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to make low-interest loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> about reinvestment act compliance .
     Few petitions , however , have actually delayed or scuttled mergers .
     The current dispute involves allegations that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act .
     During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> legal aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , filed a petition with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">counties</ENAMEX> .
     The petition challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> 's lending record in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , saying that the bank-holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had `` shut itself off from contact with the low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> . ''
     In deferring action on the merger , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> said , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board</ENAMEX> does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> to allow -LCB- it -RCB- to reach a final conclusion on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> it serves in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Comptroller of the Currency</ENAMEX> is expected to begin a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act</ENAMEX> examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next two weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> , with assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 32 billion</NUMEX> , said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> added that it believes the review will `` demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> is in compliance with the requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has already missed its initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1 target date</TIMEX> for completing the merger .
     It said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it still expects to close the acquisition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in 1990</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida National</ENAMEX> , if acquired , would almost double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> 's banking franchise in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</NUMEX> in assets .
     That would make it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barnett Banks Inc.</ENAMEX> , in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Union</ENAMEX> shares rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Florida National</ENAMEX> stock closed unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.875</NUMEX> in national over-the-counter trading .
     Earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> denied an application by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand Canyon State Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scottsdale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , on grounds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> had n't fully complied with the Community Reinvestment Act .
