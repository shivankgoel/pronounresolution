     They said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Howell</ENAMEX> is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .

     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Trust</ENAMEX> 's earnings have been hurt .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of computer workstations , reported sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 538.5 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter ended Sept. 29</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 388.5 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> 's results were slightly better than expectations .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it expected to break even for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 530 million</NUMEX> .
     In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott McNealy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those new computers , called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sparcstation 1</ENAMEX> , accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,000</NUMEX> systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> shipped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , he said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than two-thirds</NUMEX> of the systems shipped , meanwhile , were products introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> to meet demand for its newest computers well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> .
     These problems also resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> reporting a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.3 million</NUMEX> loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter ended June 30</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNealy</ENAMEX> said the issues that hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> 's performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> are now `` largely '' behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , and he indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> 's profitability should increase throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> also reported a record backlog of orders .
     While this indicates continued strong demand for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's desk-top computers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> faces increasing competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co .</ENAMEX>
     Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> also is vulnerable to competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> , which plans to introduce a group of workstations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Next Inc</ENAMEX> .

     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> prepares a fresh package of sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> , the already-tense relationship could get worse .
     The problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> will be to weigh what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> is saying to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> against the more conciliatory message it is delivering to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> told him : `` We should not mind those who participated in demonstrations , signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> added , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee </ENAMEX>, that `` we really made mistakes .
     We must not shirk our responsibility and we can not just blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> also reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> that , in a separate meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang Zemin</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> `` looked kindly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who took part in the demonstrations . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> also pledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> would publish `` very soon '' a list of those killed .
     And he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were `` very much concerned '' about the deaths and had arranged aid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     `` I transmitted my conversations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says .
     But , he adds , `` I was not acting as a messenger . ''
     He says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> never asked him to convey their statements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> spontaneously invited him to do so .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , but attributes that to the fact that the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> is `` very complex . ''
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> hopes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> 's fairly conciliatory comments will prod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to be cautious about further sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> . `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> does n't want to have legislative sanctions , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     `` But he may not have a choice . ''
     Given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> may be unable to prevent new sanctions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations .
     Sentences have been stiff .
     A university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years</TIMEX> for participating in the rallies , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> said , while an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> .
     Nor has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> hinted to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> that it will publish the identities of those killed .
     So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> are officially considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evil-doers</ENAMEX> , and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> receive no compensation .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> gunned down by a stray <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">bullet</ENAMEX> while cycling to work carries , after his death , the official stigma of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterrevolutionary</ENAMEX> , '' his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> says .
     What 's more , much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's official rhetoric is hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> frequently lambastes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> for harboring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astrophysicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fang Lizhi</ENAMEX> , a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissident</ENAMEX> who took refuge there after the massacre .
     `` In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , there are still <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to crush <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> and interfere in our internal affairs , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu Qizhen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , said as he left for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation .
     It will probably be attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> authorization bill , which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is n't expected to veto .
     A congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> involved in drafting the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> enacted shortly after the massacre .
     But as legislative action , they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to rescind .
     Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges , a suspension of most high-level government contacts and a halt to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade enhancement programs , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Overseas Private Investment Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trade Development Program</ENAMEX> .
     Codifying those sanctions could prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> retaliation .
     `` If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sides are n't careful , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> ties could spin downward , out of control , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> .

     TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 2 , 1974</TIMEX> , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">That Labor Day</TIMEX> , in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major act after succeeding the resigned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald R. Ford</ENAMEX> signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</ENAMEX> .
     Pension reform was its main thrust .
     Labor and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , quoted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Rose Garden</ENAMEX> rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .
     IRAs were like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stepchildren</ENAMEX> there .
     The IRA 's conception is murky .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Shultz</ENAMEX> , with the key support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Curtis</ENAMEX> , sought some form of pensions for the uncovered .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">That year</TIMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lieber</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Legislation and Regulations division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of the Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> , was assigned the task of designing a plan .
     They used the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1962</TIMEX> Keogh Plan , a pension plan created by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">self-employed</ENAMEX> , as a partial model .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> initially called its new model Personal Retirement Account , or `` PRA . ''
     But it did n't sing .
     So they opted for IRA , naming it after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Cohen</ENAMEX> , a brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actuary</ENAMEX> who helped them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira</ENAMEX> , himself , confirms this account .
     IRA rules have been changed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> raised to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,000</NUMEX> a year from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,500</NUMEX> the amount a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could put , tax-deductible , into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> under employer retirement plans .
     This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , mutual funds and others .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sharply reduced the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth .
     IRA account assets have grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 400 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 393 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 26 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Bank</ENAMEX> announced a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions , in an apparent attempt to curb the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency .
     The measure , which will take effect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Wednesday</TIMEX> , will create a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tier exchange rate .
     Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 0.63 rubles</NUMEX> to the dollar .
     But for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.26 rubles</NUMEX> to the dollar .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tass</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> said the devaluation also will apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> ' transactions .
     But it did n't elaborate , and it remains unclear how far Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut .
     The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has opened up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> to foreign trade , the discrepancy has become ever greater .
     Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> who could exchange a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> -- albeit illegally -- for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about four rubles</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> are now being offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 rubles</NUMEX> or more .
     Even at such rates , black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketeers</ENAMEX> have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here .
     They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up .
     The going rate for a small personal computer that costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2,000</NUMEX> in the West is anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000 to 100,000 rubles</NUMEX> .
     Even a pack of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Western cigarettes can fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 rubles</NUMEX> or more .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 300 billion rubles</NUMEX> in savings accounts and little to spend them on , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> has already tacitly admitted that the ruble is n't worth much , announcing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> that it will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in hard currency for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">produce</ENAMEX> that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas .
     `` The absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone , '' the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Izvestia</ENAMEX> wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Bank</ENAMEX> 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> say is still far away .
     Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> , but the size of the cut took many Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> by surprise .
     `` It 's much bigger than we expected , '' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> , who asked not to be named .
     The next step , which could have a larger effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , will come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next month</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs</ENAMEX> is to hold its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> auction of foreign currency .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> needing Western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids .
     Plans for the auction , which was supposed to take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> and become a regular event , have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that hold some are unwilling to part with it , and joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> are n't yet allowed to participate .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Kremlin</ENAMEX> also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction , using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods .
     If foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> could sell their currencies freely at the new , better exchange rate , that would enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Bank</ENAMEX> to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time .
     But the amounts they exchange may be limited ; most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> , for example , demand payment in hard currency from Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> .
     Unless other rules are changed , the devaluation could cause difficulties for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it is primarily meant to help : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> who travel abroad .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> taste of life abroad .
     But under current rules , they are allowed to change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 200 rubles</NUMEX> into dollars and other currencies for each trip .
     At the new rate , that would give them <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 30</NUMEX> to travel on .
     It is n't yet clear whether the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200-ruble</NUMEX> limit will be lifted .
     If it is n't , the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">75th</NUMEX> anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve System </ENAMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> think it 's time to take a fresh look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">75 years</TIMEX> there may be a few things that are worth reexamining .
     The regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> setup , for instance , may be out of date .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier years</TIMEX> it may have seemed reasonable to give <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Richmond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and allow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> only a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , but times have changed .
     Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> , after all , is a national central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> .
     Some of the would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> , however , want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or , at least , part of it .
     In the beginning , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> of the currency were both ex officio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1935</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> was trying to find someone or something to blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression</ENAMEX> , it decided to drop both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter Glass</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX> who was then back in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , probably influenced the decision .
     He said that when he was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> he felt that he had a great deal of power and , somehow , he did n't think that was a good thing .
     Times have changed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Dorgan</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.D .</ENAMEX> -RRB- has introduced a bill in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , co-sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hamilton</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , that would put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX> back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1935</TIMEX> , would be doing something .
     So far no one has suggested putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady </ENAMEX>, the incumbent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX> , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorgen</ENAMEX> has changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea .
     That may have pleased the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Erich Heinemann</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ladenburg , Thalmann &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , suggests that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> may figure he already has all the power he needs .
     Like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretaries</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course .
     He was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">treasury</ENAMEX> .
     After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> market crash , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> as a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> headed a presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> 's recommendations was that a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> , should coordinate regulation of all financial markets .
     This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> to try to expand his power , but so far <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> has n't made a pitch for the job .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> it appears to have handled them well .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> has said he thought government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions , but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> advanced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nearly two years ago</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , moreover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> has joined other administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in trying to urge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> toward lower interest rates .
     The urging admittedly has been gentle .
     In an interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> is , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth .
     At least some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> , of course , would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">St. Louis Fed</ENAMEX> held a conference to assess the system 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">first 75 years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Meltzer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Carnegie-Mellon University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> , noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's record included the longest , most sustained , peacetime inflation in our history , dating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989</TIMEX> .
     The inflation-growth argument is an old <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady </ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> or off , is surely trying to influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> policy .
     Equally importantly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX> has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar down by shopping avidly for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> marks and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> yen .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">treasury</ENAMEX> can do something on its own , but to have any hope of success it needs help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> .
     The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> has been helping , but apparently not especially eagerly .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has been intervening in foreign currency markets , all right , but through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , at least , it appeared to be `` sterilizing '' the intervention .
     In other words , it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market .
     Now , sterilized intervention may have some effect .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully , for fear of what the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> may do .
     But it 's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> may have stopped sterilizing , but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar .
     The dollar is still highly volatile .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday 13</TIMEX> market drop , only Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> know .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Feldstein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Bureau of Economic Research</ENAMEX> , argued forcefully that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies .
     Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . ''
     The more we think about it , the more we suspect Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> does indeed have enough power where he already is .

<DOCNO> WSJ0937 </DOCNO>
     This has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> policy toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
     It has also been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> when inside-the-beltway <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> has had a high old time gnawing over ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> junket in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> has done nothing to dispel that impression .
     In fact , however , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> can actually do something .
     Our ability to influence the outcome of events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is far more marginal .
     Those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard A. Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> confessed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> ignored universal human values by invading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM Treaty</ENAMEX> '' by building its radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> is no longer a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Socialist Peoples</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">republic</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> no longer has automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress of Peoples Deputies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> was not backed unanimously by his fellow party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionaries</ENAMEX> when he took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's new maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     All of that is just for starters , or so the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Eastern Europeans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> seem to hope and are certainly demanding .
     Of like , though lesser , note , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-square behind perestroika and glasnost , and therefore behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> or so .
     And , last but not least , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> now views the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> as `` absolutely extraordinary '' and believes that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> `` ca n't turn the clock back '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> because the change is too inexorable , '' as he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.W. Apple Jr .</ENAMEX>
     -LRB- In other words , after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berlin</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Siberia</ENAMEX> is a good thing to be welcomed , rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion . -RRB-
     All of this is what history will note , assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke , when the record of this time is put down .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> , however , who write what they fondly view as history 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> draft , this has also been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> to give a lot of space and time to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> 's sales appearance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> on behalf of a communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> and its controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> .
     It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">republic</ENAMEX> 's highest office .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">industrialist</ENAMEX> has coughed up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 2 million</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> estimate puts the total tab at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 million</NUMEX> .
     All of which has enabled those of us in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apple</ENAMEX> and I did <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Nightline</ENAMEX> . ''
     Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target .
     As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> so aptly put it , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was simply doing what he had always done before his election -LRB- and some would say thereafter as well -RRB- .
     He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ?
     Primarily because there 's more to the matter than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> 's personal values , or lack of them .
     Selling the presidency for a mess of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pottage</ENAMEX> is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards .
     The theme song for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> has been , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Anything Goes</ENAMEX> , '' and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism .
     There are those who say that this is nothing new , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> has always suffered from a bad case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced .
     There is evidence to support that view .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Eighty-three years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William James</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.G. Wells</ENAMEX> : `` The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success ... that , with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success , is our national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> . ''
     But if it was the national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> , it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> the national commonplace .
     If there is no law against it , do it .
     If the law leaves loopholes , use them .
     If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead .
     And if you are caught or if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't '' and brazen it out .
     As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong .
     -LRB- See , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bakker</ENAMEX> 's remarks upon being sentenced to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this Tuesday</TIMEX> for defrauding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze </ENAMEX>'s speech of confession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> affair .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> publicly concedes that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> `` violated norms of behavior '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and just plain lied about the radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">station</ENAMEX> .
     We have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in high place still lying through their teeth about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> , and that apparently is n't going to change .
     For that matter , those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">long ago</TIMEX> identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liars</ENAMEX> are still given respectful hearings in the press .
     That is the key to the current `` national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> . ''
     No one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law .
     The occasional media witch hunt about some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> 's private peccadilloes notwithstanding , the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain , `` Who am I to judge ? ''
     Thus , no standards , no judgment and no values .
     `` You are mad because he 's making so much money , '' say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> .
     No , we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him , enlisting it in the service of private gain , just as we ought to be mad that public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> lie through their teeth , play disingenuous games about their activities or , to steal a phrase , make public service a private trough .
     `` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apple</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's interview .
     He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> , and it is a defensible position .
     But there is no defense at all for the ethos of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> huckstering for a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poohbah</ENAMEX> .
     Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">the United States</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .

     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have speculated that outside bids received by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> were either disappointingly low or for only part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .

     Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's biggest trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">partners</ENAMEX> gave a quick thumbs-down to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> , where world trade talks are being held under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GATT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal `` a step backward . ''
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of agriculture , forestry and fisheries told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's proposal was impractical and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> would continue to heavily subsidize its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , in a far-reaching plan submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , proposed curbing price support subsidies within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> and eliminating export subsidies within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> reacted defiantly , arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Common Agricultural Policy</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 billion</NUMEX>-a-year price support program .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> said in a statement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say they are irked that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the `` elimination '' of export subsides , not just reduction .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC Agriculture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray MacSharry</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan `` calls into question '' the agreement reached by world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> seeking `` substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection .

     He said he was surprised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> 's reaction , calling it `` vehement , even frenetic . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , who said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> made no special allowances for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     While many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> argue that food-importing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> would eventually become self-sufficient in a free-market system , the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> are likely to need help in the meantime .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was open to discussing particular problems of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free-trade goals would be achieved .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> package also says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
     It would establish procedures to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's objections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan center around its desire to stay self-sufficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> , a staple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , even though foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> are far more efficient .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent decisions by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> cast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> in the odd role of telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> how they should write history and biography .
     These decisions deserve more attention than they have received from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> , and from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> as well .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Miller</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bare-Faced Messiah : The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard</ENAMEX> '' is a biography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Church of Scientology </ENAMEX>.
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard </ENAMEX>, who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> , which licensed them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Era Publications</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Era</ENAMEX> sought a permanent injunction to restrain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Henry Holt &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> from publishing `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bare-Faced Messiah </ENAMEX>'' on the ground that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> 's quotations from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> infringed the copyrights .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> argued in response that the `` fair use '' statute permits quotation `` for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , ... scholarship , or research . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">District Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Leval</ENAMEX> denied the injunction on the ground that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Era</ENAMEX> had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> call `` laches . ''
     As for the merits , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> had written `` a serious book of responsible historical criticism . ''
     Verbatim quotation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> believed , was justified in order to prove points the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> had asserted about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> -- mendacity , bigotry , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> 's own words .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer\/critic</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> wrote , `` should not be required simply to express ... conclusions without defending them by example .
     '' In such circumstances , free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> felt constrained by an earlier decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Second Circuit Court</ENAMEX> forbidding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.D. Salinger</ENAMEX> to quote from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> 's personal letters .
     He distinguished the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases : In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> noted , the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> .
     Still the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> reluctantly concluded that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller </ENAMEX>'s quotations from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> 's unpublished writings , because they were not necessary to prove historical points , failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright .
     But the proper remedy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> said , lay in a suit for damages , not in an injunction .
     The case went on appeal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Second Circuit</ENAMEX> .
     In a decision in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April of this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Miner</ENAMEX> , joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Altimari</ENAMEX> , agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bare-Faced Messiah</ENAMEX> '' was a serious work but rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> 's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright .
     `` We conclude , '' the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> wrote , `` that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction . ''
     Had the suit been filed in time , they said , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bare-Faced Messiah</ENAMEX> '' would have been suppressed .
     This was too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oakes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> .
     In a powerful separate opinion , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> further distinguished the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> case by pointing out that a living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> , like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> , had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard </ENAMEX>.
     `` I thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us .
     This case realizes that concern . ''
     Decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Second Circuit</ENAMEX> itself , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> continued , had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use .
     And the injunction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altimari</ENAMEX> would so readily have granted had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Era</ENAMEX> sued in time ?
     Suppression of the book , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> observed , would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , and here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> went to the heart of the question , `` Responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> constantly use primary sources , letters , diaries , and memoranda .
     Indeed , it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information . ''
     Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation .
     And of course they agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can impose restrictions on the use of their papers , whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">libraries</ENAMEX> .
     But in the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bare-Faced Messiah</ENAMEX> '' case the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> found most of his material in court records or via the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX> .
     And when responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> gain legitimate access to unpublished materials , copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> understand the requirements of historical scholarship .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altimari</ENAMEX> do not appear to have a clue .
     Yet at the moment they are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who are making the law .
     As matters stand , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> ruling , torn from context and broadly construed , is controlling .
     If an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> quotes `` more than minimal amounts '' of unpublished copyrighted materials , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> decision had it , `` he deserves to be enjoined . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have not defined `` minimal amounts , '' but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers</ENAMEX> , I understand , take it to mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> words .
     The `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bare-Faced Messiah</ENAMEX> '' decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> decision , handed down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ninth Circuit</ENAMEX> , is another blow against scholarship .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Malcolm</ENAMEX> , a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> on psychiatric matters , wrote a series of articles for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , later published in book form by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knopf</ENAMEX> under the title `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">In the Freud Archives</ENAMEX> . ''
     The articles were largely based on interviews Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> had taped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Masson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychoanalyst</ENAMEX> who had served as projects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Freud Archives</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> then brought a libel suit against Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Knopf</ENAMEX> .
     As a public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> had to prove malice and , as proof of malice , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> were in fact fabricated .
     The quotes could not be found on the tapes , and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who decided the case for Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers</ENAMEX> conceded that , for the purpose of their decision , `` we assume the quotations were deliberately altered . ''
     For all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> , this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> articles .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Alarcon</ENAMEX> , joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Holcomb Hall</ENAMEX> , took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks .
     In his eloquent dissent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kozinski</ENAMEX> observed that when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> assumes that these are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> 's precise words or at least his words purged of `` uh '' and `` you know '' and grammatical error .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> have an obligation under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> to safeguard freedom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> , `` the right to deliberately alter quotations is not , in my view , a concomitant of a free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> . ''
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm </ENAMEX>, for example , wrote that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> described himself as `` the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> who ever lived . ''
     No such statement appears on the tapes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> cited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> 's remark `` It 's me alone ... against the rest of the analytic world '' as warrant for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> fabrication .
     But , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> noted , the context shows that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> 's `` me alone '' remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> had Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> describing himself as `` an intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gigolo</ENAMEX> . ''
     Again , no such statement appears on the tapes .
     The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> 's description of himself as a `` private asset but a public liability '' to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Freud</ENAMEX> and that in any case it was not defamatory .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> found the derivation entirely strained and writes that `` for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX> to refer to himself as an intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gigolo</ENAMEX> is ... a devastating admission of professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dishonesty</ENAMEX> . ''
     These were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of a series of fabrications that had , in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> 's words , the cumulative effect of making Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> `` appear more arrogant , less sensitive , shallower , more self-aggrandizing , and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements . ''
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Coles</ENAMEX> wrote in a review of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm </ENAMEX>'s book , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> emerges `` as a grandiose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">egotist</ENAMEX> ... and , in the end , a self-destructive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> .
     But it is not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Malcolm</ENAMEX> who calls him such : his own words reveal this psychological profile . ''
     We now know that the words were not always his own .
     `` There is one sacred rule of journalism , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hersey</ENAMEX> has said .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> must not invent . ''
     Should the green light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alarcon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice , it will notably reduce the value of journalism for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> -- and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> put it : `` To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print ... .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> has lost his case , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> , and the profession to which they belong , have lost far more . ''
     The historical profession will survive these decisions .
     Perhaps in time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will correct them .
     But writing history is tough enough without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> gratuitously throwing obstacles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> 's path .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlesinger</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Schweitzer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of the humanities at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">City University of New York</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Pulitzer Prizes</ENAMEX> in history and biography .

     Legal controversies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case .
     They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment .
     It has always been so .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> , a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Scopes</ENAMEX> , volunteered to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig</ENAMEX> in a test case sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Legislature</ENAMEX> .
     The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life between the `` smart set , '' whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.L. Mencken</ENAMEX> , and the religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX> , whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX> derided as benighted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primitives</ENAMEX> .
     Few now recall the actual outcome : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scopes</ENAMEX> was convicted and fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> , and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> law .
     So it was with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiss</ENAMEX> case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a generation later</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger Hiss</ENAMEX> became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Cold War</ENAMEX> and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served .
     His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> intelligence .
     And so it seems to be with the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Morgan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> has just emerged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two years</TIMEX> ' confinement for contempt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> to her many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> .
     To the rest of us , the case is a puzzle .
     It is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> call `` fact intensive . ''
     It presents no great issue of legal principle , no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt .
     Instead , it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of `` who did what to whom . ''
     It is difficult , if not impossible , for anyone who has not pored over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy .
     Certainly I do not .
     So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many , not just in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> but elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and even the world .
     I suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> themes have come together in the strange case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that it represents an intense battle in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thurber</ENAMEX> used to caricature as `` the war between the sexes . ''
     But although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> did so gently and lightheartedly , many of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> have taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> 's memorable title `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Male Animal</ENAMEX> '' quite literally .
     The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> accepted as an eternal part of the human condition .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> case .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> is a highly educated white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professional</ENAMEX> who attended some of the `` best '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Black Caucus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> asked during the debate on the legislation that freed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her ?
     Or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> would have hurried to sign the bill `` out of compassion for her plight '' ?
     To ask those questions is to answer them .
     Finally , the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is discredited in the eyes of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> for a variety of reasons , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> read the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> and watch the same TV newscasts as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the area do .
     Bashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is risk-free for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , who do not have to answer to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> for it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> as the federal budget deficit .
     Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> passed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> with almost unimaginable speed , before the judicial process had run its course , and , indeed , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex , class , race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> 's particular situation .
     It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence .
