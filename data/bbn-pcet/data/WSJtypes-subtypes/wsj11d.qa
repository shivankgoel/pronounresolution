     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> now claims that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> engaged in an elaborate strategy over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> to obscure from federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
     The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Space Systems</ENAMEX> division , which has been the focus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate overcharge prosecutions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last November</TIMEX> , a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">grand jury</ENAMEX> indicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million</NUMEX> on a logistics computer contract .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that should n't be turned over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> .
     A hearing is scheduled on the issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX>-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1985</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> was accused of defrauding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> by illegally claiming cost overruns on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Minuteman</ENAMEX> missile contracts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty and paid a fine of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 million</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Minuteman</ENAMEX> case , which involved some of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> that are at the center of the dispute in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     In order to show that all of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> contend that `` high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> provided `` misleading statements '' to then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne Orr</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> during a series of meetings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     Overall , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> depict a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , despite warnings from an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> finally disclosed the problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> contend that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> `` was erroneously informed that the -LCB- suspected -RCB- practices had only just been discovered '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     In its brief , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> asserted that it needs the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> documents to rebut anticipated efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> did n't find out about questionable billing practices until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> at his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meeting with company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> .
     Subsequent meetings , initiated after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's brief asserts .
     `` On the contrary , it shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . ''

     The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> a share at closing and a contingent payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 80 cents</NUMEX> a share placed in escrow .
     Details of the escrow agreement have n't been completed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> have speculated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> that the value of offers received by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> fell well short of what they had hoped , or even that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garth Drabinsky</ENAMEX> , is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> as a whole .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> share prices closed sharply lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> on the back of Wall Street 's steep drop and renewed fears over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> economic fundamentals .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's winning streak came to an end , and stocks fell in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> and across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> as well .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index shed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40.4</NUMEX> points to finish at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2149.3</NUMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's close , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51.23</NUMEX> points lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2611.68</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> trade figures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> and a worrisome report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Confederation of British Industry</ENAMEX> that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming year</TIMEX> .
     The trade and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBI</ENAMEX> reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-share index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.3</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1739.3</NUMEX> .
     Volume was a modest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405.4 million</NUMEX> shares traded , but better than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> 's lowest turnover of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">276.8 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> also noted an absence of institutional interest later in the session helped pave the way for broader declines when Wall Street opened weaker .
     They added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market-makers</ENAMEX> were knocking share prices down in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midafternoon</TIMEX> in a bid to attract some interest , but the action largely helped open the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's late declines .
     Insurance stocks provided some early support to the market , partly on favorable brokerage recommendatons and talk of continental <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> life and composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">insurers</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market did n't react substantially to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's disclosure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> that it will seek <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's shares outstanding when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> share regulations are lifted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed easier , posting their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six trading days</TIMEX> , partly because of programmed index-linked selling by trust investment funds in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> session .
     The Nikkei index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58.97</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35526.55</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> said the market again failed to find a trading focus , discouraging much participation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The market , however , is expected to remain stable and expectations for future gains are high , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     Such sentiment is being supported by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled to enter the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early November</TIMEX> .
     The expected amount is said to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">700 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.93 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.05 trillion yen</NUMEX> -- the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a given period</TIMEX> , following the record high set at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of July</TIMEX> , according to market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> .
     In addition to a large amount of investment trust fund cash , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> generally see the market environment improving compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past couple of weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshiyuki Nishimura</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamaichi Securities </ENAMEX>, said , `` The market sentiment is bullish , simply because there are few bad factors . ''
     Buying activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> centered on a wide range of midcapitalization , domestic demand-related shares whose prices range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000 to 2,000 yen</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> expect these shares will be targets of investment trust funds , which often buy small amounts spread across a wide range of issues .
     On the other hand , high-priced shares such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pioneer Electronic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> said .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's notable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> were highpriced shares such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> , which shed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">210 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,900 yen</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,590</NUMEX> .

     Share prices on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> closed sharply lower in thin dealings as worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> remained idle as the result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potentially destabilizing domestic developments .
     The DAX index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.85</NUMEX> to end at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1507.37</NUMEX> .
     Cutting against the downward trend was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental </ENAMEX>, which jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 marks</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">346 marks</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 187</NUMEX> -RRB- in heavy trading on rumors that the tire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> is about to be taken over .
     It jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said the market was exceptionally thin , as small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> remain on the sidelines .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are not only licking their wounds following the turbulence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , but they have also been made nervous by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , the governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Christian Democratic Union</ENAMEX> suffered a series of setbacks , the extent of which became fully known only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> , in municipal elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baden-Wuerttemberg .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are worried that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">CDU</ENAMEX> wo n't be able to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> in federal elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the end of 1990</TIMEX> .
     And statements by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IG Metall</ENAMEX> labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Steinkuehler</ENAMEX> , also cast a cloud over trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said .

     The decline in prices cut broadly through the blue-chip issues , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens</ENAMEX> tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">544</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deutsche Bank</ENAMEX> plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">657</NUMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> fell sharply as well .

     Savings and loans reject <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> said .
     But that does n't necessarily mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> are discriminating against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">arm</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , said it does n't have data on the financial position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> and thus ca n't determine why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> are rejected more often .
     Nevertheless , on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> , where the information was released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> banking subcommittee hearing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> said they are worried that financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> are routinely discriminating against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> .
     They asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> to suggest new ways to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> to comply with anti-discrimination laws .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Dixon </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on consumer and regulatory affairs , said , `` I 'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> .
     But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> -- and in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> , it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem .

''
     The trade group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> added : `` Certainly the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> should take a hard look at it . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dixon</ENAMEX> held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending .
     The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> , but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months</TIMEX> at least .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> said its studies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> received fewer home mortgages from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John LaWare</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> , told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> the evidence is mixed and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's believes the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are n't discriminating .
     For instance , he noted , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> receive more home improvement loans than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> were angered that the bank and thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination .
     `` We would be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past several years</TIMEX> '' to developing examinations for discrimination , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Fiechter</ENAMEX> , a top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision .</ENAMEX>
     `` If we 've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> , not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six months from now</TIMEX> , or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six years from now</TIMEX> , or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">26 years from now</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDIC</ENAMEX> said it has issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> citations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> for discriminatory practices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,437</NUMEX> examinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> also said that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,000</NUMEX> complaints it received since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1987</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</NUMEX> alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> investigated the complaints but no violations were cited .
     Thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiechter</ENAMEX> said that among the possibilities being considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> to fight discrimination is the use of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testers</ENAMEX> '' -- government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> who would pose as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> has used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testers</ENAMEX> to investigate discrimination in rental housing .
     Using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testers</ENAMEX> could be controversial with financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grohl</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">U.S. League of Savings Institutions</ENAMEX> had n't yet taken any position on the matter .

     The airline industry 's fortunes , in dazzling shape for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , have taken a sudden turn for the worse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few weeks</TIMEX> .
     Citing rising fuel costs , promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel , several major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> have posted or are expected to post relatively poor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , recently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the industry 's stellar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers</ENAMEX> , posted a worse-than-expected <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 77.7 million</NUMEX> net loss for the period .
     So far , the industry 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth quarter</TIMEX> is n't looking too strong either , prompting many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> to slash earning projections for the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> by as much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fourth</NUMEX> .
     And they say the outlook for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> is nearly as bad .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Airlines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> `` came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Murphy</ENAMEX> , an airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     This turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets .
     Now , many airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> might become a lot less attractive as takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">targets</ENAMEX> on Wall Street .
     The downturn also raises questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> ' ambitious orders for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> , which currently total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32.5 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three years</TIMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> , though , the industry 's problems have had some positive effects .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Others have tried to spruce up frequent-flier programs .
     Previously , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan American World Airways</ENAMEX> went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 to $ 1,000</NUMEX> to certain frequent-flier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> making trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Atlantic</ENAMEX> flights in business class or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class .
     The industry 's slowdown became apparent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , reported an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income and said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter</TIMEX> would be `` disappointing . ''
     Shortly before that , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> had said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results would be `` significantly lower '' than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , it provided the details :
     Its loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 77.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.86</NUMEX> a share , contrasted with net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 68.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.58</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.3 %</NUMEX> in the latest period , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.53 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.48 billion</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Arlington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's net plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">76 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 142.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.28</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.75 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.22 billion</NUMEX> .
     The results surprised many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> has almost no competition in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piedmont Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     Shortly after announcing its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> loss , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir </ENAMEX>'s stock tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> a share .
     It ended at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40.125</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.375</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     `` Nobody was expecting this size of a loss , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Karos</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp .</ENAMEX>
     One airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , who declined to be identified , called the loss `` amazing . ''
     In announcing the results , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> cited many of the same problems that several other industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have named recently .
     It said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> scared off many leisure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> .
     To try to combat the traffic slowdown , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> started reducing fares ; average fares rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , in contrast to increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> each in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> .
     But so far , the effort has failed , and traffic is still slow .
     Some other fare promotions have backfired .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This summer</TIMEX> , the industry introduced a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> fly free '' program , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Airlines</ENAMEX> tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">days</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> expected .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Airlines</ENAMEX> also say their frequent-flier programs are squeezing profits because awards are being redeemed at a heavier-than-normal rate .
     One airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> times as many free-travel coupons are being turned in as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous years</TIMEX> -- not surprisingly , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> allowed many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> to build up mileage at triple the normal rate .
     Rising operating expenses are another problem .
     Fuel costs were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Labor costs , which leveled off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> because of lower pay scales for newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , are on the upswing again at many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> .
     And some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> are facing other unexpected headaches : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> , for example , blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     `` We can not quantify the total adverse effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Colodny</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> .
     Whatever the cause for the downturn , few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are predicting any sudden improvement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Airline Economics Inc.</ENAMEX> , an aviation consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , is projecting an industrywide operating profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , compared with earlier forecasts of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion to $ 3.5 billion</NUMEX> .
     As for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> predicts that profit will slip to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> .

     Good grief !
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Brown</ENAMEX> is selling out .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metropolitan Life</ENAMEX> ads were bad enough .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> will also be featured in a new public service effort for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Way</ENAMEX> .
     Beyond the advertisements , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicator</ENAMEX> is planning a traveling arena show , new TV specials for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and even an exhibit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Smithsonian Institute</ENAMEX> .
     The yearlong schedule of festivities will be kicked off officially with a combination live and animation half-time special at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .
     All the tie-ins , though , have some marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> questioning whether the party may go too far .
     `` There are too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> participating , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Ries</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trout &amp; Ries</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , marketing consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` If you want to cut through the clutter , you have to make your message as distinct , sharp and individual as possible .
     Sharing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> is n't a way to do that . ''

     The debt load would have been higher but for a reduction of A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> from asset sales , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> said at a business gathering .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> indicated the consolidated debt figures , which include debt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Group Ltd.</ENAMEX> , will be published soon in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 annual</TIMEX> accounts .
     He predicted the debt will be reduced by another A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990</TIMEX> , but did n't explain how this will be achieved .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> blamed rising <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> interest rates and the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Group</ENAMEX> `` with its very high levels of shortterm debt '' for producing a condition `` that was no longer sustainable .
     `` In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> said , `` we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> . ''
     That reassessment resulted in continuing asset sales , as well as write-offs exceeding A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last fiscal year</TIMEX> .
     `` In essence we have made a decision to clear the decks , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> told the meeting .
     While some assets have been written down , others are undervalued in the accounts , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> maintained .
     Among these are the company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> brewing assets , in the books at A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 950 million</NUMEX> but actually worth A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> , he said .
     An investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Chile</ENAMEX> 's telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is carried at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 300 million</NUMEX> but really worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 500 million</NUMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's property portfolio is undervalued by at least A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> forecast that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next June</TIMEX> , `` what will emerge will be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with a honed sense of purpose ... a stable balance sheet , with good-quality assets in brewing , telecommunications , media and property . ''
     He did n't name energy resources in that list , signaling that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's coal and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">interests</ENAMEX> might be for sale in total or in part .
     Some of the oil interests already have been sold .
