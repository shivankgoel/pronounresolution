     A proposed conflict-of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> may thwart many high-technology new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">ventures</ENAMEX> , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> policy would require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to cut financial ties with health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> -- or lose their government money .
     Among other concerns , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , governmental fear of abuse has risen . But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Smith</ENAMEX> , associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">provost</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> is asking grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 15</TIMEX> .
     After that , it will make a final decision on the policy . The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lithox Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salem</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">start-up</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly </ENAMEX>, a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TA Associates</ENAMEX> , a venture-capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.3 million</NUMEX> , he and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lithox</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to market a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gallstone</ENAMEX> cure being developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California at San Diego</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> , who are being financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lithox</ENAMEX> funds , will receive a royalty , or percentage of sales , if their research yields a commercial product .
     But because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California</ENAMEX> , like many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> , shares its royalties with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> , it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> says .
     The high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commonwealth BioVentures Inc.</ENAMEX> , a venture-capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 600,000</NUMEX> to launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amira Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Worcester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> that will produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rima Kaddurah-Daouk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Schimmel</ENAMEX> conducted the initial research at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
     While Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaddurah-Daouk</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">MIT</ENAMEX> to head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amira</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schimmel</ENAMEX> will continue to work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">MIT</ENAMEX> , serve on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amira</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> and own a small equity stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amira</ENAMEX> transaction is typical of the way venture-capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> develop the basic research , `` venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria W. Doubleday</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> . ''
     But the new guidelines could prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schimmel</ENAMEX> from being involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">start-ups</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amira</ENAMEX> , venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> point out .
     And if that happens , the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed , they say .
     The stakes in the controversy are large .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 600 million</NUMEX> to finance start-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in medical and biotechnology businesses , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Venture Capital Association</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties . In many of these deals , `` venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> had the inside track , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Bock</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avalon Ventures</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">La Jolla</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> were willing to gamble on new technologies because `` we had exclusive rights to those technologies , '' he adds .
     But under the proposed guidelines , all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work .
     `` Without the exclusivity , most venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> wo n't have the incentive to invest in such deals , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bock</ENAMEX> says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avalon</ENAMEX> and others invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Athena Neurosciences Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">South San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , to license and develop technology for delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> to the brain .
     But before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Athena</ENAMEX> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Register</ENAMEX> published most of the details , `` giving all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> a chance to exploit it , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bock</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Athena</ENAMEX> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it .
     But , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bock</ENAMEX> , `` It was a close call . ''
     The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to waste scarce capital , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> say .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">start-ups</ENAMEX> ca n't have early access to research being conducted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Emyanitoff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of business development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Applied bioTechnology Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">start-up</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emyanitoff</ENAMEX> says .
     For its part , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> insists that its guidelines `` should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratory</ENAMEX> to commercial use . '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">Universities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">MIT</ENAMEX> should be able to develop a way to act as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">brokers</ENAMEX> for the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Bick</ENAMEX> , who oversees the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> grants program as its deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for extramural research .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures .
     Not long ago , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> holding stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc.</ENAMEX> were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are also concerned about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> getting a `` free ride '' on government-sponsored research .
     A congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommitee</ENAMEX> has been investigating the potential abuse from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> holding stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> exploiting their research .
     Among other provisions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> guidelines would prohibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of their immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from holding stock in any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that is affected by the outcome of their research .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> , says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> merely meant to be `` ideas for discussion . ''
     The predictions of doom are `` premature , '' she says .
     But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> circulate guidelines , they 've often already formulated policy , veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> say .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> already are taking note .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 14</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> began circulating a conflict-of-interest policy statement that , in effect , would follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> guidelines faithfully .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California at San Francisco</ENAMEX> is also circulating a memo among its scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> that will restrict contact with the world of business .
     In many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are shunning contacts with venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> policy is settled .
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly </ENAMEX>, the venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalist</ENAMEX> : `` It does n't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy .
     The damage is already done .

Hooker</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> , filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> protection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and has also announced its intention to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B. Altman &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> department store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> 's planned sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> is subject to approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brozman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ENAMEX> .
     Rumors to the effect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> would file for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> arose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in the jewelry industry .
     At that time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Merksamer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> , angrily denied that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was about to file .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> is leading the buy-out .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> close to the situation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> to speed the sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> said an accord signed by the unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> had frozen in place all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> 's assets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement . `` By filing for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> will only need approval from a bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> for the sale , not the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX> , '' said this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     `` The cash from the sale will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> itself will belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Merksamer</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Sigoloff</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> , were unavailable for comment .
     In a statement , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> were properly stocked for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas season</TIMEX> , necessitated our filing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> .

     For all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's explosive run-up in stock prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance Investment Management Inc.</ENAMEX> 's computer sat on the sidelines .
     Now it 's on the fence .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>-based money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manager</ENAMEX> , began buying stocks again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> that it oversees for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's revised strategy .
     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has thought stocks are worth owning .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , timed to coincide with the maturity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills for the time being .
     Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said they believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</NUMEX> buy program was carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc</ENAMEX> .
     As reported , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> bought shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> as part of a customer strategy shift , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> was said then to have been <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> declined comment .
     When it owns stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's portfolio typically is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX> large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> solicits Wall Street brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> winning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price .
     That puts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day</TIMEX> , but finished with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a four</NUMEX>-point loss .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's last portfolio shift , carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , was a highly publicized decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last January</TIMEX> to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     The sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock market , came when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     At the time , the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200 .
     The Dow average now stands <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> higher , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6 %</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first three quarters of the year</TIMEX> .
     The computer 's miscalculation has been painful for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> .
     Almost any money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> holding stocks has turned in better results , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has played it safe with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     So why does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> 's computer like stocks with the Dow at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2653.28</NUMEX> , where it closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , when it did n't with the Dow at 2200 ?
     `` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better value all the time , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W. Terrizzi</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Three-month</TIMEX> T-bill yields have fallen to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of the year</TIMEX> .
     Stock prices , meanwhile , are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 140</NUMEX> points lower than the peak of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2791.41</NUMEX> reached on the Dow industrial average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 9</TIMEX> .
     Are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> wo n't say specifically , explaining that if there was such a move , it would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about three days</TIMEX> to complete the loose ends of the transaction .
     During that time , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> with the clout of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand .
     But everything is relative to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> , so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills , even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .
     `` Our -LCB- computer -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> has a certain trigger point , '' he said .
     When the computer says switch , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> switches .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> previous shifts from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of asset to another in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> history .
     Almost all have involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> and often the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation .
     Competing asset-allocation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> march to their own computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> , so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has sat on the sidelines .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market , rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> confirms some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> have left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> , but no major ones , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has added new accounts .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Evans</ENAMEX> , who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> resigned as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> `` for personal reasons '' just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> filed for bankruptcy-law protection , has been temporarily reappointed to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">37 years old</TIMEX> , would join the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     He succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Kimmel</ENAMEX> , who resigned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> saying his participation in evaluating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's role in buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> was no longer necessary .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> will stay until a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> is found , but not later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     It was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">49-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> who had moved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> and run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia Ltd.</ENAMEX> 's aborted bid for the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> terminated the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> merger because of a dispute over a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> letter of credit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> -- which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> -- found itself facing problems of its own .
     And the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> appears to be quickly deteriorating .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> was about to default on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> payment owed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> in connection with the distribution of a television program .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> was depending on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> to arrange financing .
     But early on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two hectic days</TIMEX> of board meetings , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> said he believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> would n't be forthcoming .
     He recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> file for protection under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> deadline , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> familiar with the sessions .
     But a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , which includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , overrode him .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> resigned .
     Later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">source</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> reversed itself , decided to file for bankruptcy protection , and asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> to stay on .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> he needed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> to think about it .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Monday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 25</TIMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tracking Travel</ENAMEX> '' column advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad</ENAMEX> '' because credit-card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> charge <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars .
     In fact , this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad .
     In contrast to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> conversion fee charged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Visa</ENAMEX> , foreign-currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> routinely charge <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> or more to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars into foreign currency .
     On top of this , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> of conversion .
     At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due .
     The card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> will pay the modest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> fee only on the amounts actually needed .
     Typically , he will be billed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only several weeks</TIMEX> after the expenditure , and then has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another couple of weeks</TIMEX> before he has to pay the bill .
     In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> -- often more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> during that `` float '' period alone .

     The proposed stock offering and issuance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1.8 million</NUMEX> common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> 's total shares outstanding to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28.7 million</NUMEX> , of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72 %</NUMEX> will be owned by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tracinda</ENAMEX> , according to the prospectus .
     In over-the-counter trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> was bid at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.50</NUMEX> a share .
     Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Desert Inn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resort</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> , refurbishing certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand Air</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , and to acquire the property for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resort</ENAMEX> .

     Construction is set to begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1991</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resort</ENAMEX> will include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand Hotel</ENAMEX> , a multi-spired , castle-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> that will include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">85,000 square feet</NUMEX> of casino space .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> poured <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</NUMEX> more into money-market mutual funds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> despite further declines in yields .
     Assets of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> taxable funds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBC\/Donoghue 's Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> jumped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 351.2 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Tuesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Holliston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newsletter</ENAMEX> said .
     Assets soared <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous week</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a tenth of a percentage point</NUMEX> , the largest drop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midsummer</TIMEX> .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> compound yield , which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> , fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.47 %</NUMEX> , its lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.55 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> before , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> .
     `` Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Malizia Negus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> .
     Money funds invest in such things as short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities , commercial paper and certificates of deposit , all of which have been posting lower interest rates since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> .
     Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short-term instruments .
     The yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's auction , for example , was just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.77 %</NUMEX> .
     The average yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> CDs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000</NUMEX> or less at major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.96 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Tuesday</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banxquote Money Markets</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way that money fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments , so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period .
     The average maturity of the taxable funds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> follows increased by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">40 days</TIMEX> , its longest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     `` They 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them , slowly , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Frank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donoghue Organization</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> .
     Average maturity was as short as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">29 days</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of this year</TIMEX> , when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> compound yield of the funds reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.62 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late April</TIMEX> .
     The highest-yielding funds are still above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> .
     The top-performing fund in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar , with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> compound yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.45 %</NUMEX> .
     The fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas .
     It is currently waiving management fees , which contributes to the higher yield .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> simple yield of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> funds fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.14 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.21 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> reported .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-day</TIMEX> simple yield slid to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.22 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.26 %</NUMEX> , and the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-day</TIMEX> compound yield fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.56 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.60 %</NUMEX> .

     Many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are facing a double whammy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> : They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market , and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> invested in `` leveraged '' junk bond mutual funds , the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk .
     It 's a good strategy in a rising market , where a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> leveraged portfolio in effect allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">125 %</NUMEX> of their money working for them .
     The strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio .
     Trouble is , junk bond prices have been weak for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> .
     Thus , the leverage has amplified the funds ' portfolio losses .
     And shares of leveraged junk funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold .
     `` That 's really where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leverage</ENAMEX> hurt , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Herzfeld</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX>-based investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who specializes in closed-end funds .
     `` Share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold '' in the junk market , he says .
     Leverage is never a problem for the traditional `` open end '' mutual funds , which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all .
     Leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds .
     The usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock , using the proceeds to buy additional bonds .
     The fallout for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> lately has been painful .
     Consider the New America High Income Fund .
     With a leveraged position of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 45 %</NUMEX> , the fund 's share price has plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.5 %</NUMEX> so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     That 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio , whose total return -LRB- bond-price changes plus interest -RRB- has amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a negative 6.08 %</NUMEX> .
     Such problems may not be over .
     Leveraged funds in particular `` are still extremely vulnerable , because we 're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Foot</ENAMEX> , a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newgate Management Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Northampton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market .
     `` If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Perritt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mutual Fund Letter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , they might shy away .
     In a typical leverage strategy , a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money .
     If the market surges , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> can make that much more profit ; the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     But when the market moves against the fund , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> lose more than other junk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged .
     Fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , for their part , defend their use of leverage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Ericson</ENAMEX> , who runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund , says the fund 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> leverage has jacked up its interest income .
     `` As long as I am borrowing at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.9 %</NUMEX> and each -LCB- bond -RCB- yields over that , it enhances the yield , '' he maintains .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ericson</ENAMEX> says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio .
     Yet some funds have pulled in their horns .
     New America High Income Fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> in preferred stock and notes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The fund made a similar move <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     `` We are trying to increase our flexibility , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen E. Terry </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ostrander Capital Management</ENAMEX> , the fund 's investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> .
     She declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund 's recent purchases , sales or cash position .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry</ENAMEX> did say the fund 's recent performance `` illustrates what happens in a leveraged product '' when the market does n't cooperate .
     `` When the market turns around , '' she says , `` it will give a nice picture '' of how leverage can help performance .
     Several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said .
     But a few funds have taken other defensive steps .
     Some have raised their cash positions to record levels .
     High cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls . Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Frabotta</ENAMEX> , portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-manager</ENAMEX> .
     He says the fund , which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds .
     `` I do n't want to be in a position to have to sell , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frabotta</ENAMEX> says .
     Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash .
     At the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>-leveraged Zenith Income Fund , portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bianchi</ENAMEX> recently dumped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mesa Petroleum</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wickes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Horsehead Industries</ENAMEX> , among others , to raise his cash position to a record <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> .
     `` That 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bianchi</ENAMEX> says .
     He concedes : `` This is the most difficult market that I 've been involved in . ''
     Because of the recent junk-market turmoil , the fund is considering investing in other issues instead , including mortgage-backed bonds .
     `` We 're looking at the leverage factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Moore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bernstein-Macaulay Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and the fund 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> .
     `` At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> point , if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost -- and at the moment we 're right on it -- we 're going to have to make a move .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more bizarre garden stories since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eden</ENAMEX> has been unfolding for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> now , in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> .
     And if she and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Battery Park City Authority</ENAMEX> have their way , her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden `` artwork '' in the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">complex</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> scheme is called , will occupy the last <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">3.5 acres</NUMEX> of open space at the southwest tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
     It could cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> to install and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">BPC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> a year to maintain .
     Created by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> who flaunts her ignorance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and gardens , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , as now planned , will die from congestive garden design .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett </ENAMEX>'s previous work , which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world , often took gardens as its nominal subject .
     Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPC Fine Arts Committee</ENAMEX> think she had a literal green thumb .
     -LRB- Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> would not discuss her garden for this article . -RRB-
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> she boasted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> : `` I 'd never looked at a garden in my life . ''
     And she proved no shirking <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">violet</ENAMEX> in her initial statement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York State</ENAMEX> public benefit corporation : `` The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden , which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain . ''
     Undeterred , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> hired Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> and another confessed garden ignoramus , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Cooper</ENAMEX> , who claimed he had never visited , much less built , a garden , and said of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">project</ENAMEX> , `` I do n't view this as a landscape .
     I view this as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> did have garden experience .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bruce Kelly\/David Varnell Landscape Architects</ENAMEX> had created <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Central Park</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strawberry Fields</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare Garden</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> called its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> a `` stunning '' collaboration .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> , though , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> design is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> uncollaborated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> .
     She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> , landscape fragments , rudimentary square <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> , circles , triangles , rectangles -- and fit them into a grid , as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall .
     But for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> inside them .
     In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">kelly\/varnell</ENAMEX> called this `` arbitrary and amateurish . ''
     The landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> were expelled from the garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     All the while , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had been busy at her assignment , serene in her sense of self-tilth .
     As she put it in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> lecture at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard Graduate School of Design</ENAMEX> : `` I have designed a garden , not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip . ''
     Moreover , she proclaimed that `` landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> have been going wrong for the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> '' in the design of open space .
     And she further stunned her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> by revealing her secret garden design method : Commissioning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> to spend `` <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six thousand dollars</NUMEX> ... on books that I ultimately cut up . ''
     After that , the layout had been easy .
     `` I 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail . ''
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> told her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> `` because I do n't think you can do watered-down versions of things . ''
     -LRB- This was never a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> had long since given in to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett </ENAMEX>'s every whim . -RRB-
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> was afforded a preview of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett </ENAMEX>'s creation in a tablemodel version , at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">BPC</ENAMEX> exhibition .
     The labels were breathy : `` Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a thousand years</TIMEX> in garden design ... a rose garden , herb garden , serpentine garden , flower fields , an apple orchard ... organized in a patchwork of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">50-by-50-foot</NUMEX> squares to form ` rooms ' ... here and there are simple architectural forms , a whimsical jet of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> , a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid , and chairs of every sort to drag around ... .
     At the core of it all is a love for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> who studied the maquette were alarmed .
     They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett </ENAMEX>'s little rooms left little room for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kelly\/Varnell</ENAMEX> had put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> ' carrying capacity at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> per room , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> overall .
     This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">digs</ENAMEX> : `` My <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">loft</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">50 by 100 feet</NUMEX> , so <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">50 feet by 50 feet</NUMEX> seemed like a good garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> . ''
     Inside the grid were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> of these plant cells jammed full of clutter .
     One she made into a topiary rec <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , replete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> shaped into a Barcalounger , TV , piano and chairs .
     In another , she requisitioned topiary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">MX</ENAMEX> missile cones -- costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> each -- in heights up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">20 feet</NUMEX> .
     Another she stuffed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> `` rectilinear <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> '' for a topiary geometry lesson in the right-angling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> .
     In the herbal lounge she specified a `` plaid knot garden '' decor .
     She ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">foyer</ENAMEX> done in a different plaid planting , and made the landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> study a book on tartans .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">roomette</ENAMEX> she implanted a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">43-foot square glass cube</NUMEX> meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit , a `` zinc sink , '' a `` huge fishbowl with carp '' and a `` birdcage with cockatoos . ''
     Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , where , she suggested , a flat of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">strawberries</ENAMEX> might be displayed in the dead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> .
     In another compartment called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Linden Bosque</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> linden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were to be crowded together at killing intervals of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 or 16 feet</NUMEX> .

     One thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> plan was never in doubt : It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rosarians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orchardists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arborists</ENAMEX> .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> blithely suggested calling upon `` semi-skilled garden club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for maintenance . ''
     Furthermore , she had insisted on paths so narrow -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">five to eight feet</NUMEX> -RRB- and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cherry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickers</ENAMEX> -- could n't maneuver .
     Then , to make these gardenettes quite literally <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had thrown up windowless walls -LRB- brick , lattice , <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedge</ENAMEX> -RRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 feet</NUMEX> tall , casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade .
     It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> without decking the walls in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>-like array of Gro-Lites .
     Finally , flouting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> 's wishes to continue the popular <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two-mile</NUMEX> riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Esplanade</ENAMEX> , prized for its expansive views of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">New York Harbor</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Statue of Liberty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Ellis Island</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> threw up yet another wall , this time concrete , this time <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 1\/2 feet</NUMEX> tall .
     She ran it the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> riverfront , blotting out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's great natural water features , the harbor and the river .
     -LRB- Within her garden , she has decreed a waterfall , a rill , ponds and other costly , trivial waterworks beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Hudson</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     While the model was still on view , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Manhattan Community Board 1</ENAMEX> passed a resolution against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parks Council</ENAMEX> wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> that this `` too ` private ' ... exclusive , '' complex and expensive `` enclosed garden ... belongs in almost any location but the waterfront . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynden B. Miller</ENAMEX> , the noted public garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> who restored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Central Park</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Conservatory Garden</ENAMEX> , recalls her reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> model in light of the public garden she was designing for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">42nd Street</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Bryant Park</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Bryant Park</ENAMEX> , as designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1933</TIMEX> , failed as a public space , because it made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel trapped .
     By removing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> and some walls , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Bryant Park Restoration</ENAMEX> is opening it up .
     It seems to me the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> plan has the potential of making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> a horticultural jail for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> urban horticulture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cornell Cooperative Extension</ENAMEX> weighed in with a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> that began : `` We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed . ''
     They then addressed the decidedly `` questionable safety of ... a complex garden of endless hiding places .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ft. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> which obstruct views in and out of small ` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> ' insure ... that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime . ''
     -LRB- At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had declared : `` There are going to be problems with safety ...
     I 'm not going to address questions of safety ! '' -RRB-
     Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">South Gardens</ENAMEX> design somehow continues on , seemingly impervious to reason , stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Emil</ENAMEX> hopes to negotiate a seawall that could `` be significantly more visually permeable . ''
     And by substituting yet another landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Quennell</ENAMEX> , he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the `` artistic vision '' of a `` truly great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> . ''
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> of no progress in this direction , it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> will suddenly now be possible .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quennell</ENAMEX> has said he plans to go with the grid , regardless . -RRB-
     There is still time , however , for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabian Palomino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BPCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> , to prevent this topiary `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tilted Arc</ENAMEX> . ''
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statesmen</ENAMEX> might take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Robinson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The English Flower Garden</ENAMEX> '' -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> 's bible since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1883</TIMEX> -- who seems to have had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> in mind when he wrote : `` Unhappily , our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> when applying his ` designs ' to the garden ... .

     I read the exerpts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Angell</ENAMEX> 's exchange with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gosbank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails</ENAMEX> , '' editorial page , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 5</TIMEX> -RRB- with great interest , since the gold standard is one of my areas of research .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angell</ENAMEX> is incorrect when he states that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility . ''
     During the latter part of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">19th century</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Russia</ENAMEX> was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 100 %</NUMEX> of its outstanding currency , but no one outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Russia</ENAMEX> used rubles .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England </ENAMEX>, on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</NUMEX> of its outstanding currency , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> notes were accepted throughout the world .
     The most likely reason for this disparity is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> was a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> to collect claims against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> were well established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> .
     By contrast , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Russia</ENAMEX> an authoritarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> owned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     The success of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency .
     It is no coincidence that from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1844 to 1914</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> was an independent private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , the pound was never devalued and payment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England </ENAMEX>, the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and earning assets in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> with distributions based on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> laws .
     Unless the laws determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">noteholder</ENAMEX> 's rights to payment are independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> of those notes , however , a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> as it was for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czars</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> told a congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> that he would consider imposing `` circuit breakers '' to halt program trading at volatile times .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> , in his first testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> since taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> post , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> is studying the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> market plunge , including how current circuit breakers affected the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> and the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     After the study , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones , he added .
     Circuit breakers , designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements , curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points .
     At certain points during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> drop , circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market , slowing trading at times .
     A circuit breaker that would have closed down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> was n't tripped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> , is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb `` turmoil '' in the marketplace .
     He argued that program-trading by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 15</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> is pushing around the markets and scaring individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> did n't reject the proposal .
     After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> study of the drop is completed , he said , `` I 'm perfectly happy to work with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> ... in identifying whether we need other devices , '' such as a program-trading curb .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> under then-chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> .
     The measure is expected to move through this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     But the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> the right to close the markets at times of stress .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> contended that uncertainty over when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> might act could worsen volatility in the markets .
     He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> offered strong support for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other provisions in the bill .

     In a rare package sale of its real estate , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Troy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , has sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of its strip shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> to a limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Pilevsky</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> familiar with the transaction .
     They estimate the value of the transaction at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 100 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilevsky</ENAMEX> would n't comment on the sale .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> previously had announced it would report its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> consecutive decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> earnings for the period ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same day</TIMEX> the real estate deal was completed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> are estimating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings will drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 13 % and 20 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 50 to 55 cents</NUMEX> per share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">63 cents</NUMEX> per share in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago quarter</TIMEX> .
     It is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> will have on earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> developed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> , which range in size from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">about 150,000 square feet</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">just over 250,000 square feet</NUMEX> .
     Most are anchored by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> reportedly will lease its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> back from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> , who plans to expand the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> comprise a total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">about 1.6 million square feet</NUMEX> of retail space .
     They are spread around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and include locations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilevsky</ENAMEX> , who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philips International Holding Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a dozen</NUMEX> other shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tenant</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> is fighting back against junk mail .
     So much of the stuff poured into its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Austin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> that its mail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> there simply stopped delivering it .
     Now , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of mailers , catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash .
     `` We just do n't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to -LCB- deliver -RCB- it , nor do we have the space or the time , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Schaumburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> area .
     `` It 's the overload problem and the weight problem we have . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> is in good company .
     Businesses across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> are getting fed up with junk mail , and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore -- literally .
     While no one has tracked how many company mail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> throw out junk mail , direct-mail advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> say the number is growing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Flint</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air Products &amp; Chemicals</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Allentown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing .
     Why the revolt ?
     Anybody with a mailbox can answer that : sheer , overwhelming , mind-numbing volume .
     According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Direct Marketing Association</ENAMEX> , total direct mail -- to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> -- jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65.4 billion</NUMEX> pieces in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years earlier</TIMEX> .
     Though direct mail to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> is n't broken out separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">association</ENAMEX> says it 's growing even faster .
     The deluge has spurred cost-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to action , with mail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it .
     The direct-mail industry , not surprisingly , is fuming at the injustice of it all .
     After all , this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect , that is the butt of so many jokes that television 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">L.A. Law</ENAMEX> '' portrays direct-mail-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> as short , bald , intensely nerdy , and unremittingly boring .
     The practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> throwing out junk mail `` is a commonly known problem , and it 's increasing as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> attempt to put through budget cuts across the board , '' right down to the mail-room level , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Belth</ENAMEX> , a list <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Direct Marketing Association</ENAMEX> 's business-to-business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">council</ENAMEX> .
     `` But it 's like biting the hand that feeds them , because every one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> uses direct marketing . ''
     It 's almost impossible to track the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> trashing junk mail , since the decision is usually made in the mail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> -- not the board <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     And the practice often varies from location to location even within a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> seem especially inclined to dump mailers sent to titles rather than to individual names .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to lose patience , deciding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> .
     Magazines are n't delivered at all , even if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> 's name is listed ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> or the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">library</ENAMEX> -- and are told to change the subscriptions to their home addresses .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air Products </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , the mailroom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> opens junk mail and often throws it away -- even if addressed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> .
     `` If they get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> packets of something , they open one , see what it says , throw <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">48</TIMEX> away and send <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">departments</ENAMEX> they think are appropriate , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     Direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> were especially alarmed when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> -- one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and a big direct-mail user itself -- entered the junk-mail battle .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1</TIMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Flint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , stopped delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> were told that if they really wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publications</ENAMEX> , they would have to have them sent home instead .
     The reason : overload , especially of non-subscription magazines .
     Direct-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's stand as an ominous sign -- even if the junk-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">kings</ENAMEX> did bring it on themselves .
     `` Why anyone would want to close themselves off -LCB- from direct mail -RCB- , a priori , does n't make any sense , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bronner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bronner Slosberg Associates</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> directmail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` It smacks of big brotherism .
     They 're going to decide what their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can or can not read . ''
     The practice is , however , legal in most cases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Ellis</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> postal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Postal Service</ENAMEX> 's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> ; once it gets there , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can do with it what it wishes .
     The junk-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">titans</ENAMEX> , ever optimistic , are looking for ways around the problem .
     So far , they say , it has n't had any noticeable effect on response rates .
     And before it does , they 're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place .
     Among other things , the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications .
     `` We 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Miller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quill Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lincolnshire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , business-to-business mail-order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But then again , mailing less and smarter wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> proposal .
     Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> , the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> on the tax-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds , perhaps as soon as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> all but conceded defeat , telling Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell </ENAMEX>: `` I sense at this stage you may have the votes . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> sparred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> decorum .
     Their tone was good-natured , with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again .
     Although the proposal , authored by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roth</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , appears to have general backing by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> , who are under increasing pressure from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to reject the gains-tax cut , are finding reasons to say no , at least for now .
     A major reason is that they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
     It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
     `` A number of us are not going to touch capital gains , IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Robb </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two days</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> .
     And at a luncheon meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> .
     The trend is making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of the tax cut less optimistic about success .
     `` There is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> shot of getting it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of cutting the capital-gains tax .
     He called the battle `` uphill . ''
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic .
     `` There will be no capital-gains bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     `` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal .
     The IRA portion -LRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> plan -RRB- is irresponsible . ''
     Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> has made clear to his wavering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> that the issue is important to him personally .
     Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal .
     Estimates requested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Joint Taxation Committee</ENAMEX> show that the richest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 million</NUMEX> each in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> for which figures are available .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> acknowledged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they are open to making a variety of deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> asked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> for discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood-Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back , one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> think that there are numerous other important measures <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> -- that might provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> leverage in cutting deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
     A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage .
     Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
     If they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan , administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also are n't ruling out making a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to put off a vote until a firm date in the future , even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> .

     It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> providing comprehensive services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> 's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> it serves and represents .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Medical Tribune</ENAMEX> reported that a growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are challenging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation .
     `` They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tribune</ENAMEX> said .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , some institute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medication</ENAMEX> to a generic one or from one generic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of a specific product to another .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologists</ENAMEX> were beginning to report these observations as well .
     Call it anecdotal if you will .
     But no ethical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> would switch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were doing well on a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medication</ENAMEX> from a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> to prove a point .
     We do not depend on pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> for our support .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services ; collects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> fees ; receives money through contributions from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">foundations</ENAMEX> and bequests .
     The funds received from pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are used to offset physician symposiums , and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">The Epilepsy Institute</ENAMEX> 's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we treat and care <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">about daily</TIMEX> .
     This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious .
     But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's health care or for the cost .
     For whom is the saving ?
     Surely not to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> who depend on the same levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medication</ENAMEX> in their bloodstream <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> to maintain seizure control .

     In the lobby behind its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-story , orchid-strewn <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">atrium</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">20,000-gallon</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">aquarium</ENAMEX> will come alive with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stingrays</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">angelfish</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puffers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> of the deep .
     And oh , yes .
     There 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> , the financial heart of it all .
     This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 630 million</NUMEX> island-fantasy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel-casino</ENAMEX> now being completed for opening in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Golden Nugget Inc</ENAMEX> .
     It 's the most stunning example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> 's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">resort</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> has seen nothing quite like it before .
     Not for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> has a big new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel-casino</ENAMEX> opened here .
     Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 290 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Excalibur</ENAMEX> are going up .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Excalibur</ENAMEX> , with a castlelike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> , jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions , will be able to handle up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> visitors a day when it opens in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand Inc.</ENAMEX> proceeds with its plan for an amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">park</ENAMEX> -- a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 700 million</NUMEX> movieland <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resort</ENAMEX> with a working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> that would become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> 's biggest -- the investment in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> properties will total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> has agreed to buy a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">117-acre</NUMEX> site for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resort</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93 million</NUMEX> in cash plus stock currently valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 30 million</NUMEX> .
     Smaller projects swell the figure to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> .
     Still other projects that have been announced but not yet started could put expenditures above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen A. Wynn</ENAMEX> , who owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.4 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Golden Nugget</ENAMEX> 's shares , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> and other projects will help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> attract a whole new generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> .
     `` If you create a wonderment , if you create something so exciting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> dreams of being part of it , then they 'll come , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">projects</ENAMEX> already under construction will increase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> 's supply of hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,795</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,500</NUMEX> .
     By a rule of thumb of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> new jobs for each new hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Clark County</ENAMEX> will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 18,000</NUMEX> new jobs .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1988</TIMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">307,000</NUMEX> jobs , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95,400</NUMEX> of them in the tourist industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Projects</ENAMEX> in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Hotel-casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> play down the possibility of a labor shortage .
     After all , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> newcomers a year are settling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Las Vegas Valley</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nevada</ENAMEX> state labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> think a shortage is probable .
     Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines , crap tables or roulette wheels <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> will add to the enormous store that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Luck</ENAMEX> already <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> here , much less the ultimate impact of the growth on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> and municipal services .
     `` Traffic is certainly a concern , as is pollution , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> and an adequate labor market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sain</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau</ENAMEX> .
     City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> have managed to push through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">projects</ENAMEX> that are crucial for tourist growth , such as the expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">McCarran International Airport</ENAMEX> to accommodate the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> who fly here .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , by one means of transport or another , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 18 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     The expansion will set off a marketing war among the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hotel-casinos</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> promises , or threatens , to become a giant carnival , with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> to be had for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45</NUMEX> a day or less , for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> uninspired solely by gambling .
     Amid a riot of jousting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX> , circus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clowns</ENAMEX> , gold-leaf <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centurions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> of the wild , lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> will fall .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caesars World Inc.</ENAMEX> plans to defend its august reputation by sinking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190 million</NUMEX> into its opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caesars Palace</ENAMEX> , next door to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> , and adding a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> shopping area reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Rodeo Drive</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Palace</ENAMEX> , with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers , is already well-known for its Caesarean theme .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Flamingo Hilton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Frontier</ENAMEX> and others are pouring <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> into facelifts , new room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">towers</ENAMEX> and casino floor space just to keep up .
     Where 's this huge amount of investment capital coming from ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Golden Nugget</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> , has borrowed on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 600 million</NUMEX> worth of mortgage notes , mostly sold to private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> , to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circus Circus</ENAMEX> among them , are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate Bank of Nevada</ENAMEX> .
     Will the investments pay off ?
     The growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> tourism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> persuades <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> that they will .
     Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> left <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> with the area 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casinos</ENAMEX> , nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> more than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nevada</ENAMEX> 's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade .
     `` If you build a better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mousetrap</ENAMEX> , it will catch more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Benninger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand </ENAMEX>.
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Cokely</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Alton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , seems inclined to agree . `` I 'd love it if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> had something else to do here , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cokely</ENAMEX> , watching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">seven-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristin</ENAMEX> on the water slide at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Strip</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Wet 'n' Wild</ENAMEX> water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">park</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two generations ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> by himself for a little diversion , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Heffner</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Nevada Hotel and Motel Association</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">One generation ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> .
     Now , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '90s</TIMEX> , we 're headed toward a total resort environment . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only a decade or so ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> balked at in-room TV sets and other fripperies that distracted from gambling .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Casinos</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> offer bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">alleys</ENAMEX> , water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">parks</ENAMEX> , golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">courses</ENAMEX> , tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">courts</ENAMEX> , lush swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">pools</ENAMEX> and other diversions , and more such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">facilities</ENAMEX> are being designed .
     Despite the new emphasis on the family trade , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it , with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> call <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> remaining on the scene .
     A serious economic downturn , pessimists observe , could hurt the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expansionists</ENAMEX> .
     For now , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naysayers</ENAMEX> ' voices are drowned by the roar of cement <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">mixers</ENAMEX> and the clanging of construction cranes along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Strip</ENAMEX> .
     This is no place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX> , but at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:30</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a recent morning</TIMEX> , when construction choked traffic at the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:BORDER">Four Corners</ENAMEX> intersection to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lane , a taxi <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> found it faster to abandon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cab</ENAMEX> and walk to her destination .
     The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership .
     It has happened before .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dunes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aladdin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Riviera</ENAMEX> were all acquired by the present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> .
     Yet that has n't discouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Some have bought big chunks of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Strip</ENAMEX> property for what may turn into another wave of building .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlantic City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> is scouting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place .
     Even before the huge new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">projects</ENAMEX> began , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Strip</ENAMEX> 's recent expansion squeezed smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     Many blue-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> of downtown 's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Strip</ENAMEX> or to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Laughlin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Colorado River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> catering to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">snowbirds</ENAMEX> and the recreational-vehicle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> .
     Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> have hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">motels</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , the number of motel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> has fallen by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</NUMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here expect a room-rate war as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">projects</ENAMEX> open .
     `` There 's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next year</TIMEX> , but after that you should see the market return to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>-plus occupancy and regular rates , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rubeli</ENAMEX> , casino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada Inc.</ENAMEX> , which runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tropicana </ENAMEX>.
     Skeptics wonder whether mega-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">resorts</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> will be able to squeeze a profit from their cash flow .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 1 million</NUMEX> a day to operate .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wynn</ENAMEX> seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit , but some securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> doubt it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Competitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that among large existing properties <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally Manufacturing Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally Grand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hotel-casino</ENAMEX> probably will be hardest hit among major properties .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> decline to discuss the situation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally</ENAMEX> bought the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hotel-casino</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Kerkorian</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four years ago</TIMEX> .
     Only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift .
     Its parking lot is inconvenient , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> lion's-head logo still appears in places , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> still call it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand</ENAMEX> , rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bally Grand</ENAMEX> .
     It has a `` great location , but they 're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Lee</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     Older properties that still have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1950s</TIMEX> image are also vulnerable .
     Any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hotel-casino</ENAMEX> without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Schaeffer</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circus Circus </ENAMEX>.
     `` If you do n't know what you are , bigger wo n't make you better , '' he says .
     `` But it 'll sure make you poorer . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circus Circus</ENAMEX> 's flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> has become the envy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circus Circus</ENAMEX> lures them with low room rates , inexpensive buffets and entertainment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at no extra charge .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Excalibur</ENAMEX> will also appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , of course .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">castle</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schaeffer</ENAMEX> says , will be `` the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have resisted the temptation to add <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     `` More <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> are n't the answer for us , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caesars World</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gluck </ENAMEX>.
     While his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> is building a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> style and redoing existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> , it has decreased the number of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> .
     Some have been combined into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suites</ENAMEX> for the high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caesars</ENAMEX> has made a specialty of catering to high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> from abroad , who are also being aggressively courted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mirage</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Las Vegas Hilton</ENAMEX> and others .
     Other , smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> are also pursuing market niches -- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> , for example , or the local trade .
     `` There 's still room for boutique properties , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Barrett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MarCor Resorts Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Strip</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MarCor</ENAMEX> is building the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rio</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">hotel-casino</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> theme and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 430</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> -- all of them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suites</ENAMEX> .
     Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Las Vegans</ENAMEX> have n't forgot that gambling is still what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> is all about .
     `` The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> when when the thrust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casinos</ENAMEX> was all high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> , with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor , are gone , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> says .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> and Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> said recently they 've joined the search .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the subject came up again when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> does n't have any provision in mind , but line-item-veto bait will be like earthworms at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> in the coming Continuing Resolution .
     The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law .
     We have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Glazier</ENAMEX> first made the case on this page .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> budget `` reform , '' passed over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> 's veto , took away the presidential impoundment power , thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazier</ENAMEX> discovered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Founders</ENAMEX> had worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> might take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> out of the loop .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article I , Section 7 , Clause 3</ENAMEX> says that whether it 's called an `` order , resolution or vote '' or anything else , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> must have the chance to veto .
     Labeling an omnibus budget a `` bill '' ca n't deprive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of his power to veto items .
     Finding a test case should n't be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> had the perfect case , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> blinked before it could go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> and S&amp;L stories broke , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressmen</ENAMEX> began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> might some day get them in trouble .
     They worried about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interior Department</ENAMEX> directive to log all communications with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> inserted the following into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interior</ENAMEX> appropriation : `` None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Dept. of the Interior</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power .
     When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> caved .
     The fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has of any line-item-veto test led <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , `` This section shall be effective only on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1 , 1989</TIMEX> . ''
     This means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interior</ENAMEX> contacts can not be logged only on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one day</TIMEX> -- a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that had already passed .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> is looking for another unconstitutional bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> vetoed this as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> violation .
     The `` Fairness '' Doctrine 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> are incumbents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts , deterring feisty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">challengers</ENAMEX> .
     There are also other provisions requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressmen</ENAMEX> to join treaty-negotiating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and new restrictions on OMB .
     Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets , but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     Commenting on the budget mess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said : `` The perception out there is that it 's the fault of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     And you can look to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and ask them why that is the perception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     Exactly right .
     Now 's the time to make the political case that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is in no position to naysay Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> now that we 're into <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> 's sequestration .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just this week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference met -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> , divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> different subconferences .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> agreed to close some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> in exchange for such goodies as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> for a parking lot at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOSPITAL">Walter Reed Hospital</ENAMEX> .
     Conference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hefner</ENAMEX> pulled down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> in military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bases</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and graciously allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> should take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work .
     He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> may have lost any sense of discipline , but that does n't mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> must learn to live forever with this mess .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has the power to change how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> works , if only he will use it .

     Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI Television Inc.</ENAMEX> proposed to restructure much of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations .
     The leveraged buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 %</NUMEX> of the common equity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> , giving the rest of its stake to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> in the restructuring .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> also signaled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> would resign from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Holders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 507 million</NUMEX> of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 %</NUMEX> equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV .</ENAMEX>
     They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's problems .
     `` I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Davis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.D. Smith &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> here .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> interpreted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> move as a desire by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> to wash its hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> .
     But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> says that with only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> equity stake , it would n't be appropriate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> to keep board representation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> already has made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</NUMEX> of gains from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier</TIMEX> transactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , thus it is n't significantly affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's troubles .

     It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> for a leveraged buy-out .
     Through investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> is offering to exchange <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> value at ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70 cents</NUMEX> on the dollar .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> would give up a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> equity stake to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> , while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> would surrender an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> stake .
     While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> thinks that 's pretty generous , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkholders</ENAMEX> had been hoping that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> would invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> needs new equity to survive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 153 million</NUMEX> of bank debt .
     It also would defer interest and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> on junk bonds that have fallen due ; the grace period for paying the bill expires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 16</TIMEX> .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> estimate the restructuring would cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> cash interest bill from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 90 million to $ 85 million</NUMEX> .
     Yet to pay that interest bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> will only produce <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 80 million to $ 90 million</NUMEX> of cash flow a year .

     Office Market Weakens In Overbuilt <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">NORTHEAST</ENAMEX> office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress , most often associated with the real estate market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southwest</ENAMEX> , are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">projects</ENAMEX> are now in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> , including a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">425,000-square-foot</NUMEX> office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Falls</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J .</ENAMEX>

     Rising office vacancy rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Fairfield County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> scrambling to restructure loans .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Topaz</ENAMEX> , a translucent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">mineral</ENAMEX> that is often whitish when taken from the ground , can be turned blue by irradiation , which transforms it into a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gemstone</ENAMEX> that looks like an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aquamarine</ENAMEX> .
