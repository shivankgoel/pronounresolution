     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Famous Teddy Z</ENAMEX> , '' which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> had hoped would emerge as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule , is n't turning out to be the hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> envisaged .
     Although the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> situation comedy seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Mondays</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific</TIMEX> time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> may announce `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z</ENAMEX> '' is moving to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30 p.m.</TIMEX> from its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX> time slot , replacing `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The People Next Door</ENAMEX> , '' which became the first network show to be canceled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this season</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z</ENAMEX> , '' which centers on a mailroom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX>-turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> talent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , was scheduled in the coveted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 p.m.</TIMEX> slot to follow `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> , '' a situation comedy about a television news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candice Bergen</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z</ENAMEX> '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart Corp .</ENAMEX>
     It was promoted on cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">services</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MTV </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nick at Night</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">VH-1</ENAMEX> , and premiered as the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-rated show for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> after the premiere , the series has floundered .

Nielsen Co .</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z</ENAMEX> , '' produced by the television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> , was in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37th</NUMEX> place .
     Worse , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">every week</TIMEX> it suffers audience drop-off from `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> '' and viewership on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> picks up again once `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z</ENAMEX> '' is over and is followed by `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Designing Women</ENAMEX> .

     `` There is strong indication that ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z '</ENAMEX> is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sisk</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> '' was viewed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.1 %</NUMEX> of the available television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> , while the number dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.6 %</NUMEX> for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Teddy Z</ENAMEX> '' and rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.2 %</NUMEX> for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Designing Women</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creator Hugh Wilson</ENAMEX> , for example , included the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> , `` but that is not the right focus anymore , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> and the business of being an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> .

     The stock market 's woes spooked currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> but prompted a quiet little party among bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Prices of long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds moved inversely to the stock market as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening .
     But the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies .
     The bond market got an early boost from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the opening-hour</TIMEX> sell-off in stocks .
     That rout was triggered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> 's announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> that the proposed management-labor buy-out had collapsed .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> shifting assets from stocks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
     At its strongest , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond rose more than a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 10</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     As the stock market recovered some of its losses <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later in the day</TIMEX> , bond prices retreated .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the combination of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consecutive decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> durable-goods orders and lackluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> sales helped prop up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market .
     A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices .
     On the surface , the decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> durable goods -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.1 %</NUMEX> -- did n't appear very weak .
     But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 %</NUMEX> after falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> reported that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> sales were running at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5.8 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> , far less than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected .
     Taken together , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX>-sales and durable-goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> do n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease credit policy soon , reports like those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> help build the case for lower rates .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are looking toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> 's report from national purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> employment report as potentially prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to lower rates .
     The stock market 's precipitous drop frightened foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , who quickly bid the dollar lower .
     But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses , so did the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy weakens , the dollar ended down only modestly .
     In major market activity : Bond prices rose .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The yield on the issue slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.89 %</NUMEX> .
     The dollar retreated .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading the currency was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8355 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8470 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .

     When the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy</ENAMEX> assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Slovakia</ENAMEX> hovered over the cradle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edita Gruberova</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bratislava </ENAMEX>, she sprinkled her with high E flats , sparkling Ds , clean trills , and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust .
     Maybe she could drop by at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Metropolitan Opera</ENAMEX> and bring along what she forgot , a little charm , a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig .
     Cast as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta Valery</ENAMEX> in a new production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">La Traviata</ENAMEX> , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gruberova</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> did many things nicely and others not so well .
     It is n't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">every day</TIMEX> that we hear a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta</ENAMEX> who can sing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> act 's high-flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly stitched together .
     Never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow .
     She was as cool as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cucumber</ENAMEX> .
     But as you may know , things are not going well for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta</ENAMEX> .
     There are times when she must show a little emotion .
     She has <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> , after all , and a weak-kneed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> ; and though a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courtesan</ENAMEX> , she is just about overdrawn at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     Worse , her walls move all the time -- at least in this production .
     Just when Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gruberova</ENAMEX> sat down away from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to cough in private , her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">salon</ENAMEX> began sliding around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stage</ENAMEX> ; her country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">hideaway</ENAMEX> also has a very active set of drapes .
     Hold on to those funny braids ! you wanted to caution her as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">sets</ENAMEX> started to roll around once more .
     This is the most moving `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Traviata</ENAMEX> '' I 've ever seen .
     Normally , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta</ENAMEX> can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as gracefully as the scenery .
     But this is a production designed and directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco Zeffirelli</ENAMEX> and paid for by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sybil Harrington</ENAMEX> , who has no need to count her pennies , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta</ENAMEX> , down to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 louis</NUMEX> at the opera 's end .
     Seeing all those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> in action , I was just so relieved that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gruberova</ENAMEX> , gawky thing that she is , did n't accidentally smother herself in a drape .
     Large and lavish , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Traviata</ENAMEX> '' is another addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Met</ENAMEX> 's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeffirelli</ENAMEX> .
     They have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast is n't up to either .
     If a strike ever hits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Met</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">company</ENAMEX> can still sell tickets to his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Boheme</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Turandot</ENAMEX> '' and boom out recordings -LRB- of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">another era</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> 's discerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> gave a bigger hand to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">greenhouse</ENAMEX> than to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Shicoff</ENAMEX> , who sang an aria inside it .
     Inexplicably costumed as a rabbinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> , tottering around on lifts , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shicoff</ENAMEX> hardly seemed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> to catch a fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cocotte</ENAMEX> 's eye .
     I wish he could wear lifts in his voice .
     Not nearly in his best form , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> made dullish sounds along with his usual clumsy hand gestures .
     Maybe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.</ENAMEX> was too busy taming his set to work with his naturally ungainly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfredo</ENAMEX> .
     Or is it that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.</ENAMEX> is getting a little tired of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Traviata</ENAMEX> '' ?
     This is the same production already seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Florence</ENAMEX> , and its scenic ideas echo the movie he made with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Placido Domingo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teresa Stratas</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Decades earlier</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Callas</ENAMEX> sang the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> staging that introduced the flashback idea .
     In an invention that drives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bananas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta</ENAMEX> lies dying in bed during the prelude , rising deliriously when then she remembers the great parties she used to throw .
     The entire opera is her dream .
     Given the prelude 's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act , the idea is more worn than bad , though as luck would have it , for a change there actually was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pit</ENAMEX> whom we wanted to hear , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Kleiber</ENAMEX> , trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> to stir into song .
     Once she did so , the big-souled <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX> with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid , flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging .
     Of heart-pounding moments there were nearly none , and whether this has to do with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleiber</ENAMEX> or the wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> is hard to say .
     In any event , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gruberova</ENAMEX> barely ventilated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violetta</ENAMEX> 's anguish in her long meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Brendel</ENAMEX> , who as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germont</ENAMEX> seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> lilt into his heavy , teutonic baritone .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Di Provenza</ENAMEX> '' was n't much of an advertisement for sunny , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">southern France</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleiber</ENAMEX> could let him substitute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the songs about dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark nights</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahler</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Kindertotenlieder</ENAMEX> . ''
     Speaking of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark nights </TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Met</ENAMEX> 's next-door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">neighbor</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York City Opera</ENAMEX> , has canceled its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">season</TIMEX> after failing to reach a settlement with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> , who wanted pay parity with the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Lyric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Francisco Opera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">orchestras</ENAMEX> .
     Well , they can now go and audition there .
     Good luck .
     Common sense suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who play for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that charges <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> what those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">houses</ENAMEX> do for a ticket are not in the same market .
     The cancellation bodes poorly for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beverly Sills</ENAMEX> and the amazing appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Keene</ENAMEX> as her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">his years</TIMEX> of feckless toiling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pit</ENAMEX> .
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Met</ENAMEX> discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years ago</TIMEX> following a belated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> opening , it is nearly impossible to recapture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> once they have had time to ponder their entertainment choices .
     I , for instance , was perfectly happy at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Avery Fisher Hall</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the other day</TIMEX> listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmuth Rilling</ENAMEX> conduct the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Messa per Rossini</ENAMEX> , a strange piece written by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossini</ENAMEX> after his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1868</TIMEX> .
     Each of them contributed a section at the behest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> , who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements .
     For all that , the piece landed unperformed in a dusty archive after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bologna</ENAMEX> refused to supply a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">chorus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">orchestra</ENAMEX> .
     We know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> 's own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Libera me</ENAMEX> '' was reworked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Manzoni Requiem</ENAMEX> , of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson .

     Much of the recent slide in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</ENAMEX> 's stock came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> , after negative comments by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</ENAMEX> 's stock price began its recent spiral downward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Wednesday</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results .

     The stock fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> .
     Insider selling is not unusual at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun &amp; Bradstreet </ENAMEX>; in fact , the recent pace of selling is just about average for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , according to figures compiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Invest\/Net</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">North Miami</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that specializes in tracking and analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> insider filings .
     But previous sales have often been sales of shares purchased through the exercise of stock options and sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six months later</TIMEX> , as soon as allowed , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gabele</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Invest\/Net</ENAMEX> .

     Medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all .
     Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature .
     But since the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> , we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
     Are n't we , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution ?
     If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life , then it was only a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eons</TIMEX> before splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> endowed with reason , self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> along comes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jay Gould</ENAMEX> to dash this flattering illusion .
     His credentials are excellent for the task .
     Star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of numerous popular books on science , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX> of the creationist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> .
     Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> .
     For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness ; it is a careening , chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biped</ENAMEX> was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a-million</NUMEX> shot .
     In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norton</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.95</NUMEX> -RRB- , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> makes his case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution . ''
     The argument turns on the discovery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1909</TIMEX> of an amazing fossil quarry high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Rockies</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> .
     Here , in an area smaller than a city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:STREET_HIGHWAY">block</ENAMEX> , lay buried traces of countless weird <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> that had frolicked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than 500 million years ago</TIMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's oceans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who discovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> , one <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Doolittle Walcott</ENAMEX> .
     The received <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Darwinian</ENAMEX> wisdom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> .
     Accordingly , the hidebound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traditionalist</ENAMEX> reconstructed hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess</ENAMEX> fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories .
     It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Whittington</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sharp graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> began to publish a reinterpretation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> .
     By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-dimensional structures , this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> was able to piece together a series of wondrous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasties</ENAMEX> quite unlike anything currently on the planet .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> was so fantastic in appearance , it was dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hallucigenia</ENAMEX> .
     Would that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> 's minute descriptions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> was always so colorful .
     A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text .
     These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , `` Most modern chelicerates have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> uniramous appendages on the prosoma . ''
     Interest picks up , though , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> gets around to discussing the meaning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess</ENAMEX> oddities for the theory of evolution .
     Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">earth</ENAMEX> .
     The vast majority of them , however , were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate .
     Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery `` in which each group -LCB- held -RCB- a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues .
     '' So much for survival of the fittest .
     So much , too , for the notion that we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> triumphed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Darwinian</ENAMEX> struggle by evolving big brains .
     Our mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">forerunners</ENAMEX> lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> because they were small , not smart .
     If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> sketches several .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carnivores</ENAMEX> ; in another the seas abound with `` little penises . ''
     Back when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fauna</ENAMEX> were flourishing , it seems , human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> with a backbone called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pikaia</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> finds this oddly exhilarating ; like an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">existentialist</ENAMEX> of old , he views our contingency as `` a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility . ''
     I , by contrast , can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Burgess Shale</ENAMEX> had survived instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> at once wiser and less boorish than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> might have eventually gained earthly dominion .
     But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all , the universe is a big place , and given the right conditions , sympathetic to creating some form of life .
     Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> would have risen out of the ooze to explain why , paleontologically speaking , `` it is , indeed , a wonderful life . ''

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law .
     The guidelines were distributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> but were disclosed for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time by press reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     They discourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> prior to trial .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . ''
     Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law against white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> , as opposed to alleged organized-crime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> , has come under attack from some defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> have complained that the law unfairly strips <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> of assets before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">defendants</ENAMEX> or force them into unfavorable plea bargains .
     In the new guidelines , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> '' and `` will not seek ... to take from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> assets legitimately transferred to them .

     The guidelines also state , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's crime . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> , searching for ways to pay for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion to $ 6 billion</NUMEX> in damages from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's sales tax .
     The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> on the question of how much the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is willing to spend to aid in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's earthquake relief efforts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> had sought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 4.1 billion</NUMEX> in relief , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> in aid , the bulk of which would go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     That leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion</NUMEX> short .
     A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
     According to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> of finance , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one-penny</NUMEX> increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six-cent</NUMEX> per dollar sales tax could raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Brown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Assembly</ENAMEX> , said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Deukmejian</ENAMEX> has agreed to schedule a special session of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gann</ENAMEX> limit effectively prevents the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency .
     Both Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deukmejian</ENAMEX> favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> can raise from existing sources and the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , believes `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> tax will be feasible , and it will be a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one-penny</NUMEX> sales tax increase , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Dalldorf</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deukmejian</ENAMEX> .
     The fund has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</NUMEX> and is set up to handle `` precisely the kind of emergency '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> faces , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Beermann</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> 's deputy press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> .
     But the fund 's size is disputed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> , which estimates the fund holds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">from $ 630 million to $ 800 million</NUMEX> .
     Moreover , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deukmejian</ENAMEX> `` has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this . ''
     To push through a sales tax increase , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> will have to suspend the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gann</ENAMEX> limit , citing an emergency .
     And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> period after the temporary tax increase ends , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Katz</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> of finance .
     A sales tax increase would require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> approval in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> expect broad support .
     `` If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk West</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> .
     But others think property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> ought to pay a higher portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's earthquake relief tab .
     Since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Proposition 13</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> could also increase gasoline taxes ; every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one penny</NUMEX> increase in the tax would yield <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> a month .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deukmejian</ENAMEX> and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis .
     To raise more highway funds , a measure to double the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine-cent</NUMEX> a gallon tax over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> is set to appear on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> election ballot .
     But some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> for the measure .
     Not everyone is convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs .
     `` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quentin Kopp</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">senate</ENAMEX> 's transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> .
     Separately , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> injured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> began a legal battle against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> adequately heeded warnings about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">structure</ENAMEX> 's safety .
     The claims , which were filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Board of Control</ENAMEX> but will probably end up in court , are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> arising out of the collapse of the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Cypress</ENAMEX> structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">viaduct</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can defeat immunities that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> often assert in court by showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> knew or should have known that design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">structure</ENAMEX> was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> had not seen the claim and declined to comment .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> start their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> for many reasons .
     But a chance to fill out sales-tax records is rarely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them .
     Red tape is the bugaboo of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     Ironically , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active , results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal , state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> .
     Yet every business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it .
     There is hope of change .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Wallop</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyo .</ENAMEX> -RRB- held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     `` A great many federal regulations are meant for larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">entities</ENAMEX> and do n't really apply to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marian Jacob</ENAMEX> , a legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallop</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> , which many feel benefited small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">enterprises</ENAMEX> .
     Thus , optimistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> gets around to arranging it .
     Meanwhile , they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> are banished .
     To find out what red tape riles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> most , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> asked a completely unscientific , random sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">business</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose .
     They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior , generally the best regarded form of red tape , `` create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">competitors</ENAMEX> away , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney West</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TechDesign International Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Springfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> that designs telecommunication and other products .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">West</ENAMEX> cites the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> and its standards for telecommunications equipment : `` They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market . ''
     Some gripes about red tape are predictable : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Architects</ENAMEX> complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> about car insurance rules .
     Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Dooling </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dooling &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     There is such a maze of federal , state and local codes that `` building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooling</ENAMEX> says .
     Taxi , leasing and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that maintain fleets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's very costly and time-consuming , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Rosen</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fleet &amp; Leasing Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX>-leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> spends <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 %</NUMEX> of his time on insurance , he says .
     Other forms of red tape are more pervasive .
     The most onerous , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> say , is the record-keeping and filing required by tax <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">authorities</ENAMEX> .
     Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> .
     But gripes run the gamut .
     Here is the red tape that irks surveyed business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> the most :
     ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS :
     Next to medical insurance , `` costs of compliance '' are the fastest-growing expense at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Impco Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Providence</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">R.I.</ENAMEX> , chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Gebhard</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , says spending on regulatory paper work and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 30 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gebhard</ENAMEX> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 6.5 % and 7.5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Impco</ENAMEX> 's total operating expenses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern Reproduction Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Waltham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of thin metal precision parts , must report to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">authorities</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maguire </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> state environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulator</ENAMEX> returned a report because `` it was n't heavy enough , it could n't have been correct , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maguire</ENAMEX> says .
     WITHHOLDING RULES :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Employers</ENAMEX> must deposit withholding taxes exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,000</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that 's a big problem for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     It 's especially nettlesome `` if you 're on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> and you 're the one responsible , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Brown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brown Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> money-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     EMPLOYEE MANUALS :
     Revising employee manuals on pensions , health care and other subjects costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 25,000</NUMEX> a year for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Giguiere</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Professional Agricultural Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fresno</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">provider</ENAMEX> of business services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">employer</ENAMEX> leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals do n't reflect the most recent laws , he says .
     But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that `` you need <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to help you ; you ca n't do it yourself , '' he adds .
     PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES :
     Complying with these is enough to make business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> look forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">their own pension days</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Yearly</TIMEX> changes in federal benefit laws force small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses</ENAMEX> to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Fixx</ENAMEX> , who runs her own public-relations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> .
     `` It does n't increase benefits , but it 's costly and time-consuming , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fixx</ENAMEX> says .
     Compliance added <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> to her accounting bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , she says .
     SALES TAX RECORDS :
     Advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> and other service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews .
     To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense .
     `` You need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to just take care of sales tax , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennie Tong</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lee Liu &amp; Tong Advertising Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .

     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Trinity Repertory Theater</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Bogart</ENAMEX> its artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognoscenti</ENAMEX> arched a collective eyebrow .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart </ENAMEX>, an acclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammerstein</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">South Pacific</ENAMEX> , '' is decidedly downtown .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Trinity Rep</ENAMEX> meanwhile is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's oldest and most respected regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">theaters</ENAMEX> , still hosting an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">A Christmas Carol </ENAMEX>. ''
     How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> 's iconoclastic hands ?
     She held her fire with her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Trinity</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this season</TIMEX> .
     It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Broadway</ENAMEX> anthology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertolt Brecht</ENAMEX> 's theoretical writings , called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">No Plays , No Poetry</ENAMEX> . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> , with the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxim Gorky</ENAMEX> 's bourgeois-bashing `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Summerfolk</ENAMEX> , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> has laid her cards on the table .
     Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> .
     For Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> , who initially studied and directed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> -LRB- and cites such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Stein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giorgio Strehler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariane Mnouchkine</ENAMEX> as influences -RRB- tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> , considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> socialist realism , did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> committed to enlightening the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Chekhovian</ENAMEX> humanism .
     And `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Summerfolk</ENAMEX> , '' penned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1904</TIMEX> as a kind of sequel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chekhov</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Cherry Orchard</ENAMEX> , '' is a lawn party of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allrightniks</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> .
     Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances .
     Wisely Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> has kept <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> 's time and place intact .
     Despite the absence of samovars -LRB- and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down -RRB- , the production is rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> ennui voiced by languorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> sporting beige <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">linen</ENAMEX> and rumpled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cotton</ENAMEX> , with boaters and fishing poles aplenty .
     But beyond this decorative nod to tradition , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">company</ENAMEX> head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> 's naturalistic drama into something akin to , well , farce .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> 's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered .
     Not only do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> stand outside their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and make it clear they are at odds with them , but they often literally stand on their heads .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sellars</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> manipulates her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> as if they were rag dolls , sprawling them on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">staircases</ENAMEX> , dangling them off tables , even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do .
     There are moments in this `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Summerfolk</ENAMEX> '' when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> populating the vast multilevel country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> -LRB- which looks like a parody of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> and is designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Petrovich</ENAMEX> -RRB- spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Laugh In</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` Talk hurts from where it spurts , '' one of them says .
     The clash of ideologies survives this treatment , but the nuance and richness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> 's individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> have vanished in the scuffle .
     As for the humor that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> 's text provides , when repainted in such broad strokes -LRB- particularly by the lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the ensemble -RRB- it looks and sounds forced .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> does better with music than with words when she wants , as she so often does want , to express herself through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> 's helpless play .
     Here she has the aid of her longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Helpern</ENAMEX> , whom she appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Trinity</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-ever musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and whom she equipped with a spanking new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60,000</NUMEX> sound system and recording <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helpern</ENAMEX> provided an aural collage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debussy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachmaninoff</ENAMEX> , which is less a score than a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> with a distinct point of view .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecht</ENAMEX> , and indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ezra Pound</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to `` make it new . ''
     Indeed , during a recent post-production audience discussion , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Somewhere Over the Rainbow</ENAMEX> '' so that the song 's `` original beauty comes through , '' surmounting the cliche .
     The danger that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> 's that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> is part and parcel of the problem .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Shea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Orson</ENAMEX> never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vass</ENAMEX> and the tirelessly humanitarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Lvovna</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Strickland</ENAMEX> as the long-suffering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varvara</ENAMEX> is a tiresome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whiner</ENAMEX> , not the inspirational counterrevolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX> intended .
     Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janice Duclos</ENAMEX> , in addition to possessing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> 's more impressive vocal instruments , brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olga</ENAMEX> , everybody 's favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marni Rice</ENAMEX> plays the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> with so much edge as to steal her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenes .
     But it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Trinity Rep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Fried -LRB- Zamislov</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralegal</ENAMEX> -RRB- who is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> to watch , whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> or seducing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Becca Lish</ENAMEX> -RRB- by licking her bosom .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MORGAN STANLEY</ENAMEX> , THE ONCE STODGY investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> helped a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> complete a hostile takeover .
     It was the start of a boom in unfriendly , even ungentlemanly , mergers .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 18 , 1974</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Nickle of Canada</ENAMEX> -- advised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> -- offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28</NUMEX> a share , equal to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 157 million</NUMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> battery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> said it was given only a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX> advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is called .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> 's shares , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.J.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> spurned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> had a `` white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knight</ENAMEX> '' as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Aircraft</ENAMEX> -- headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Gray</ENAMEX> , a shrewdly friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acquirer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 34</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> was advised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> warmly accepted , but a whirlwind bidding match ensued .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few days in July</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> raised its bid to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> matched it .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a single day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> lifted its offer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38</NUMEX> and then to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 41</NUMEX> , equal to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225.5 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> met the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38</NUMEX> but then withdrew .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESB</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 29</TIMEX> accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984-1989</TIMEX> -- was over .
     The new gritty game became a money maker for Wall Street 's once austere old-name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> paid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> an advisory fee of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 250,000</NUMEX> , a paltry figure by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's measures .

     The decline surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and jolted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> 's stock , which lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.6 %</NUMEX> of its value , closing at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.50</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.625</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> had been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the handful of large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent quarters</TIMEX> had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> housing market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> had been projecting fully diluted earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.30</NUMEX> a share .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed </ENAMEX>'s loan originations and purchases plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , non-performing assets rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 593 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 518.7 million</NUMEX> .
     Some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 380 million</NUMEX> of the troubled assets is repossessed real estate , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55.6 %</NUMEX> surge from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 244.2 million</NUMEX> of repossesed property <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.9 billion</NUMEX> of assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> said most of the troubled assets are apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complexes</ENAMEX> , shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">malls</ENAMEX> and other commercial real estate .
     It said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , with the rest scattered across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     It said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , but it expects sales to pick up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> market .
     Any such downturn in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> would be grim news for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> said it purposely curbed loan originations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's massive thrift bailout bill .
     It said its real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 21.7 million</NUMEX> , more than double <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> real estate profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 million</NUMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> real estate , even with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> said earnings also were nicked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</NUMEX> provision for losses associated with its previously reported plan to liquidate a real-estate franchise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HomeFed</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 82.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.52</NUMEX> a fully diluted share , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 79.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.43</NUMEX> a fully diluted share .

     Yields on certificates of deposit at major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> were little changed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> .
     The average yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> CDs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000</NUMEX> and less slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.96 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.00 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banxquote Money Markets</ENAMEX> , an information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> based here .

     Both issues are among the most popular with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` Because of shrinkage in the economy , rates can be expected to decline over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> horizon , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norberto Mehl</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banxquote</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . ''
     Changes in CD yields in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Tuesday</TIMEX> were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last two months</TIMEX> .
     Interest rates generally began declining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> after moving steadily upward for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a year</TIMEX> .

     Long-term CDs declined just a fraction .
     The average yield on both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> CDs and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> CDs was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.98 %</NUMEX> .
     Only CDs sold by major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> posted significant increases in average yields in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> , reflecting increased yields on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's auction .
     The average yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> broker-sold CDs rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.29 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.05 %</NUMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> CDs the average yield rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.30 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.09 %</NUMEX> .
     The brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , which negotiate rates with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> whose CDs they sell , generally feel they have to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> more than they can get on T-bills or from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> directly .
     T-bills sold at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's auction yielded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.77 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.82 % and 7.61 %</NUMEX> , respectively , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week before</TIMEX> .
     So-called jumbo CDs , typically in denominations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90,000</NUMEX> and up , also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , both up and down .
     The average yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">threemonth</TIMEX> jumbos rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.00 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.96 %</NUMEX> , while the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> average fell by the same amount to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.89 %</NUMEX> .

     `` It 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market . ''
     The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     Some , however , lowered yields significantly .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , for example , the yield on a small denomination <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> CD fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter</NUMEX> of a percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.06 %</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> dropped the yield on both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> `` savings '' CDs to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.33 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.61 %</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Benjamin Jacobson &amp; Sons</ENAMEX> has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in charge of trading stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">predecessors</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1930s</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has never had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> did n't open because of an order imbalance .
     When it did <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half-hour</TIMEX> into the session , it was priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 28</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's close .
     It sank further to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as $ 145</NUMEX> , but a big rally developed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half hour</TIMEX> , pushing the stock back up to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 8.375</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     In the process , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9 million</NUMEX> shares traded , making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most active issue on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     Munching <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizza</ENAMEX> when they could and yelling until their voices gave out , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Benjamin Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading post <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all .
     `` It was chaotic .
     But we like to call it ` controlled chaos , ' '' said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">47-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J.

     He manned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> post <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Bates</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">33</TIMEX> , an energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Long Islander</ENAMEX> who 's a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas Cage</ENAMEX> .
     Who was doing all the selling ?
     `` Options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> -- everyone , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> , cooling down with a carton of apple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">juice</ENAMEX> after the close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Added Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> , `` There were some pretty bad losses in the stock . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX>-share buy order at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150</NUMEX> a share entered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , which was active in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all day</TIMEX> , is what set off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX> .
     A subsequent rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-point deficit to finish only slightly below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's close .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , who had been hoping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading would get back to normal , read the news about the unraveling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover plans on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train</ENAMEX> into work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> .
     The news told them it would be a while longer before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> resumed trading like a regular airline stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">after months</TIMEX> of gyrations .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> walked into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:30 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> , he announced : `` OK , buckle up . ''
     Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> walked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> floor at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 8:45 a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and immediately spotted trouble .
     Already entered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> market , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , which closed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 178.375</NUMEX> a share , traded in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> market afterward <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as $ 158</NUMEX> a share .
     There were rumors of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 148</NUMEX>-a-share trades .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 45 minutes</TIMEX> before the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX> opening bell , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> kept getting sell orders , heavier than they imagined .
     And at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:15</TIMEX> , they posted a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 135 to $ 155</NUMEX> `` <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open .
     That range was quickly narrowed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 to $ 155</NUMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> surrounding the post were told that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 148 to $ 150</NUMEX> would be the likely target .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> finally opened <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> late , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 400,000</NUMEX> shares traded at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150</NUMEX> .
     There was `` selling pressure from everyone , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday-the-13th</TIMEX> market plunge spurred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> news was n't as bad for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's action .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that earlier day</TIMEX> , the stock 's trading was halted at a critical time so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> could catch their breath .
     Not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> , his gray hair flying , did n't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers , but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> usually handles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading on his own .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> , all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 30</NUMEX> floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> crammed near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> post <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">most of the day</TIMEX> , and probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds more</NUMEX> came and went -- a `` seething <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> , '' as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> described it .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9 million</NUMEX>-share volume flowing through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> specialist operation was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> times normal for the stock .
     The heavy buying in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half hour</TIMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> to take special steps .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> order that marked the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-day</TIMEX> turnaround caused a `` massive buying effort '' as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half hour</TIMEX> , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> .
     With <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 seconds</TIMEX> of trading to go , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> , with what voice he had left , announced to the trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> : `` We 're going to trade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> price on the bell . ''
     That meant no trading would occur in the final <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> , as a way of making sure that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last-second</TIMEX> orders are n't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 11,000</NUMEX> shares sold at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170</NUMEX> on the bell , representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight to 10</NUMEX> late orders , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> estimate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> for getting through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> without a trading halt .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , `` by way of policy , '' declined to comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> ' performance .
     Leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 5 p.m.</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> made no predictions about how trading might go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's current account deficit dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.6 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.56 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an adjusted # 2 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.21 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous month</TIMEX> , but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> economy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Confederation of British Industry</ENAMEX> 's latest survey shows that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> expect a pronounced slowdown , largely because of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">16-month</TIMEX> series of interest-rate increases that has raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' base lending rates to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> .
     `` The outlook has deteriorated since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> , with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wigglesworth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> .
     He also said investment by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">businesses</ENAMEX> is falling off .
     Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,224</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> surveyed , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 28 %</NUMEX> plan to spend more .
     But despite mounting recession fears , government data do n't yet show the economy grinding to a halt .
     Unemployment , for example , has continued to decline , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is n't currently expected to ease interest rates before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> , if then .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> views the high rates as his chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapon</ENAMEX> against inflation , which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> fear that any loosening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies .
     Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Commons</ENAMEX> debate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> said inflation `` remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being '' and promised to take `` whatever steps are needed '' to choke it off .
     The latest government figures said retail prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have started predicting a mild recession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Owen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson Group</ENAMEX> , reduced his growth forecast for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> and termed the risk of recession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> `` quite high . ''
     But he said the downturn probably wo n't become a `` major contraction '' similar to those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's current slump is a cause for concern here as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> joins in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> 's plan to create a unified market by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     Compared with the major economies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Continent</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> faces both higher inflation and lower growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next several months</TIMEX> .
     As a result , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen</ENAMEX> warned , investment will be more likely to flow toward the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> economies and `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> will be less prepared for the single market . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy , such as a surge in the volume of exports , which were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.5 %</NUMEX> higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     But while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> exports rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 8.43 billion</NUMEX> , imports shot up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 10.37 billion</NUMEX> .
     The resulting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.9 billion</NUMEX> merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 300 million</NUMEX> in so-called invisible items , which include income from investments , services and official transfers .
     Despite the narrowing of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> trade gap , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> expect the current account deficit for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> to swell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 20 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 14.6 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Increasingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> industry .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vickers PLC</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> aerospace , defense and automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , said it reached an agreed cash bid of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 108.2 million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 173.3 million</NUMEX> -RRB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ross Catherall Group</ENAMEX> PLC , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">alloy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ceramics</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">253 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.05</NUMEX> -RRB- per share representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 67 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ross Catherall</ENAMEX> 's issued share capital , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.7 million</NUMEX> ordinary shares .

     The notes can be redeemed starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1991</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said its acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ross Catherall</ENAMEX> will be covered largely by cash raised in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> disposal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Howson-Algraphy</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 241.7 million</NUMEX> .

     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bluebloods</ENAMEX> wo n't pay high prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">racehorses</ENAMEX> anymore , who will ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Breeders</ENAMEX> are betting on the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky.</ENAMEX>-based trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , has launched `` seminars '' for `` potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> '' at race tracks around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , which has held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> seminars so far , also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in this business have been insulated , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josh Pons</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bel Air</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md .</ENAMEX>
     `` But the real future of this game is in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> owning a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> . ''
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Laurel</ENAMEX> race <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">track</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> are romancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Hulings</ENAMEX> , a beer packaging plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> .
     Right now , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hulings</ENAMEX> is waving his racing program , cheering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak on the Nile</ENAMEX> , a sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thoroughbred</ENAMEX> galloping down the home stretch .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hulings</ENAMEX> gloats that he sold all his stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week</TIMEX> before the market plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , and he is using the money to help buy a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">45-acre</NUMEX> horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farm</ENAMEX> .
     `` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
     `` It 's a big-risk business , '' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles C. Mihalek</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> state securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> .
     `` You have to go into it firmly believing that it 's the kind of investment where you can lose everything . ''
     And many have done just that .
     Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spendthrift Farm</ENAMEX> , a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> horse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">farm</ENAMEX> that went public in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> recently bought the remaining assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spendthrift</ENAMEX> , hoping to rebuild it .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> that bought thoroughbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">racehorses</ENAMEX> or stallion breeding rights .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">From 1974 to 1984</TIMEX> , prices for the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">yearlings</ENAMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">918 %</NUMEX> to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 544,681</NUMEX> .
     Since then , prices have slumped , to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 395,374</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> .
     But that 's for the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> , with most selling for much less -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $ 100</NUMEX> for some pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thoroughbreds</ENAMEX> .
     Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">racehorse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport .
     Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> 's circle and high-society schmoozing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> handout promises : `` Pedigrees , parties , post times , parimutuels and pageantry . ''
     `` It 's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Headley Bell</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>-generation <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> .
     Maybe it 's not that simple .
     For starters , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">racehorse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> have to remember the basic problem of such ventures : These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> do n't come with warranties .
     And for every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">champion</ENAMEX> , there are plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nags</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Voss</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Laurel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md.</ENAMEX> , track , offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neophytes</ENAMEX> a sobering tour of a horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">barn</ENAMEX> , noting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> horses have won sizable purses .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> brown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">two-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">filly</ENAMEX> was wheezing from a cold , while another had splints on its legs , keeping both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">racetrack</ENAMEX> .
     `` You can see the highs and lows of the business all under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> roof , '' she tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` There are n't too many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">winners</ENAMEX> . ''
     Perhaps the biggest hurdle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> face is convincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> that this is a reputable business .
     Some badly managed partnerships have burned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , sometimes after they received advice from industry `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> . ''
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have developed a `` code of ethics , '' outlining rules for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> , and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest .
     But some are skeptical of the code 's effectiveness .
     `` The industry is based on individual honesty , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Hershey</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spendthrift</ENAMEX> .
     Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds , owning one still is n't cheap .
     At the low end , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> can spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> or more to own a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">racehorse</ENAMEX> in partnership with others .
     At a yearling sale , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> can go solo and get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand dollars</NUMEX> .
     But that means paying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> 's maintenance ; on average , it costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25,000</NUMEX> a year to raise a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> .
     For those looking for something between a minority stake and total ownership , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is considering a special sale where established <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> would sell a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> .
