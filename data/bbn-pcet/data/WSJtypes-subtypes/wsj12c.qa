     Big gains for the ultra-right <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Baden-Wuerttemburg</ENAMEX> state municipal elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> showed eroding support for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> in a traditional bastion for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Christian Democratic Union</ENAMEX> .
     With ballots from most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> in by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> came away with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the vote in several of the key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> .
     With many rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> yet to report ballots , election <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> estimate support for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Christian Democrats</ENAMEX> fell an average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percentage points statewide .
     The left-of-center <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> and the environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Greens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> posted mixed results .
     Headed by a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Waffen SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX> and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> has scored surprising gains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier</TIMEX> elections in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">West Berlin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hesse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North-Rhine Westphalia</ENAMEX> .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> unemployment remaining high at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX> jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> 's campaign , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> are seen drawing support for their `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> First '' stand on social-welfare issues .
     Election <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> acknowledge that a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Red</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Green</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Greens</ENAMEX> could edge out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1990</TIMEX> national election if support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> continues to spread .
     International <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> to allow prosecution of suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazi</ENAMEX> war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> who took refuge there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">after 1945</TIMEX> .
     Under current law , such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> .
     `` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Rooker</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> attending a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> conference with government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> .
     A parliamentary inquiry found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> could have been part of death squads that roamed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Nazi</ENAMEX>-occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> is expected to discuss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> whether to change the law .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> investigations were prompted by a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> alleged war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1986</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Simon Wiesenthal Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     In a sign of easing tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> said it will again take back illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> caught crossing into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> had refused to repatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> who sneaked into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> illegally since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this month</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> allowed a dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">swimmer</ENAMEX> to flee to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> said it is investigating exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ing .

Olivetti &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">OCN-PPL</ENAMEX> that makes numerically controlled machine tools .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's investigation of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known , this marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and product were named .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is worried about the convertibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> 's machine tools to military use .
     However , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">OCN-PPL</ENAMEX> , of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> sold the majority interest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , `` does n't make equipment that has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions .

     `` It is really unfortunate for human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> to be swayed by emotional discussions , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> said .
     In driftnet , or `` wall of death , '' fishing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">fleets</ENAMEX> lay nets up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">three miles</NUMEX> long that trap almost everything in their path .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> said it would cut the number of its drift-net <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessels</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">South Pacific</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> , or down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strikers</ENAMEX> voted to accept a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> bonuses .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the vote at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sochaux</ENAMEX> is expected to be followed by a similar move at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mulhouse</ENAMEX> , where the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strikers</ENAMEX> has been whittled down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">De Beers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had offered to increase the minimum wage by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> was demanding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.6 %</NUMEX> .

     But security systems , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">People 's Daily</ENAMEX> said .

     Fatalities on rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">interstates</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1986 and last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX> said in a report on the impact of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">65 miles-per-hour</NUMEX> speed limit on those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> .
     The report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> said that fatalities rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> on rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">interstates</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> highway bill permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to raise the speed limit to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">65 mph</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:SPEED">55 mph</NUMEX> on interstate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> , which are defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> that pass through areas with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .

     The report showed that deaths on urban interstate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1986 and last year</TIMEX> , while fatalities on non-interstate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> were about the same in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> that raised the speed limit on rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">interstates</ENAMEX> , the fatality rate rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 18 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> deaths per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">100 million miles</NUMEX> traveled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1986 and 1988</TIMEX> .

     In an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 10</TIMEX> editorial-page article , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">It 's the World Bank 's Turn to Adjust</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Craig Roberts</ENAMEX> lays most of the blame for what ails developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> at the doorstep of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> .
     The article is , unfortunately , replete with outrageous distortions .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts </ENAMEX>'s observations is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     This is just not so .
     The reality is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> finances are rock solid .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30 , 1989</TIMEX> -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">our past fiscal year</TIMEX> came to a close -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4.1 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> 's portfolio was affected by arrears of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">over six months</TIMEX> .
     This is an enviably low level .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800 million</NUMEX> against possible loan losses .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same fiscal year</TIMEX> , by the way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> 's net income was a robust <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> after provisions .
     Because of the business-like manner in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> goes about development , financial markets have confidence in it .
     This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.3 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> on the most advantageous terms .
     Another of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> 's criticisms is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
     Here , too , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> is way off the mark .
     The reality is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> loans have been linked to policy improvements for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">40 years</TIMEX> .
     Our traditional project loans have , for instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> as efficient , autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     By and large , these efforts have borne fruit .
     In my home region , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> , much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> also takes a swipe at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> 's adjustment lending .
     What are the facts on this type of lending ?
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> has been making adjustment loans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> .
     As their name implies , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness .
     Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parastatals</ENAMEX> in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector .
     Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> 's .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Finance Corp</ENAMEX> .
     Most recently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Group</ENAMEX> has been expanded to include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency</ENAMEX> to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> on how to improve their business climate .
     These are not the actions of a development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> alleges .
     Rather , they reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> 's time-tested , pragmatic approach , which aims at ensuring that developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> put their scarce resources to the best possible use .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conasupo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conasupo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> will sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">589</NUMEX> midsized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supermarkets</ENAMEX> and several food-production <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">warehouses</ENAMEX> beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> will withdraw from the production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> food products , maintaining production of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most important ones , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ovalle</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conasupo</ENAMEX> will cut back subsidies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of nonessential farm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">products</ENAMEX> and close retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> in wealthy neighborhoods .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conasupo</ENAMEX> controls prices on agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">goods</ENAMEX> and operates retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices .
     Business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have long criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> as a leading example of bureacratic waste .
     Private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conasupo</ENAMEX> restructuring .
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conasupo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> banned all imports of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mushrooms</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mushrooms</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> wo n't allow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mushrooms</ENAMEX> that were canned or packed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">brine</ENAMEX> at any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> to prevent '' bacterial contamination .

     In subsequent tests , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> found smaller-size cans from several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> to be similarly contaminated .
     The outbreaks were traced to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> , a type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> that produces a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toxin</ENAMEX> capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">vegetables</ENAMEX> .
     A recall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mushrooms</ENAMEX> blamed for the food poisoning began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early March</TIMEX> .

     The shipments went mostly to food-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributors</ENAMEX> that supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pizzerias</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chinese Embassy</ENAMEX> here said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mushroom</ENAMEX> contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes .

     Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 26</TIMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Politics &amp; Policy</ENAMEX> '' article about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX> 's Emergency Drug Plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> gives the impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> has not been nor is actively involved .
     This is not the case .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> is very supportive of and an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">participant</ENAMEX> in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> 's initiative .
     It was agreed at the outset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Washington Drug Initiative</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> 's role would be to continue targeting the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traffickers</ENAMEX> through our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Drug Strategy</ENAMEX> .
     Through these investigations we do not focus on the street <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> , but rather we target and attack major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX>-trafficking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> that control a large segment of the drug market .
     The trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raful Edmond III</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Metropolitan Police Department</ENAMEX> -LRB- MPD -RRB- .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> 's role is to complement the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations , but also by providing a full range of services through various task <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">forces</ENAMEX> and our contacts with local police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">squads</ENAMEX> handling drug-related crimes .
     In fact , we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> assigned full time to assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">MPD</ENAMEX> in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada Inc.</ENAMEX> revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Feb. 28 , 1990</TIMEX> , the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New World Development Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prime Motor Inns Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fairfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> 's previous plan was derailed by upheaval in the junk-bond market that hindered the offering of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> in high-yield securities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aztar Corp.</ENAMEX> , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that will operate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casinos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nevada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlantic City</ENAMEX> ,
     Under the new terms , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New World</ENAMEX> will still pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 540 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> will now reimburse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New World</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> in expenses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prime</ENAMEX> will still manage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> 's domestic franchise system when the sale closes .
     Revised terms call for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> common share to be exchanged for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> in cash , subject to possible reduction , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aztar</ENAMEX> common stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shareholders</ENAMEX> will also receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one cent</NUMEX> per share for the redemption of preferred stock purchase rights .
     The cash payout will be reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of any amount by which the weighted mean price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> 's common stock exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> the transaction closes .
     The provision will help provide for tax liabilities that may stem from the restructuring .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> 's stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 cents</NUMEX> on the news to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.25</NUMEX> in composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading .
     The announcement dispelled some Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> ' fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New World</ENAMEX> might demand a huge premium for the delay , or scrap the deal entirely .
     The previous deadline to complete the sale was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 30</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major advantage of the revised plan is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aztar</ENAMEX> will have far less debt than under the old terms .
     `` They 'll go from being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most leveraged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the least leveraged casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Lee</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> values the package at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 15 and $ 20</NUMEX> a share , based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks .
     The much-revised restructuring , which was first announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1988</TIMEX> , must again be approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> and state casino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nevada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> .

     Bond prices took the high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> and stock prices took the low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> as worries mounted about the economy and the junk bond market .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.23</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2662.91</NUMEX> in sluggish trading .
     But long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds staged a modest rally , with prices on most issues rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The dollar sagged against other major currencies in lethargic trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook .
     A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall .
     That unease is expected to grow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> reports on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> durable goods orders and again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> when the first assessment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> economic growth is released .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say they think durable goods orders fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</NUMEX> , compared with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , and that growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> slowed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2.3 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> .
     The stock market 's decline , coming after a record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119.88</NUMEX> points , surprised some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.C. Moore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Argus Research</ENAMEX> , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's rally was a reflex reaction to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> stock market rout .
     Overall , he said , the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens .
     `` We think we 're on target in looking for renewed economic deterioration , '' he said .
     `` Corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall , and the probability is that we 'll see negative economic growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Johnson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Albany Corp.</ENAMEX> , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he said the real concern among stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market .

     Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 21</TIMEX> article `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">It 's So Easy to Get Burned When Buying a Small Firm</ENAMEX> '' was excellent .
     I 've been advising small businesses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> and have lived with the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> will go out of business within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     The economic loss , jobs lost , anguish , frustration and humiliation are beyond measure .
     And most of these are absolutely unnecessary .
     Your article points out the traps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fall into , but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been avoided .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> did not review the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> 's books before buying a business .
     `` I guess I was naive , '' he said .
     There is a more descriptive word to describe his lapse of common sense .
     Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who want to start their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> are the highest failure risks .
     They know all the answers and are not used to working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 40 hours</TIMEX> a week .
     The blue-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> who decides to start a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> will listen and take advice .
     His humility gives him a much better chance of success .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few months ago</TIMEX> your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> reported the results of a study to determine why <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> who arrive in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> without any money , and unable to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , become overnight successes .
     Their `` secret '' is that they gather a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> around them , listen to what they have to say , prepare a business plan and they are on their way .
     Successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> do the same thing .
     Unfortunately , they are in the minority .
     Avoiding failure is easy .
     It 's unfortunate so many must learn the hard way .

     The management turnover at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok International Ltd.</ENAMEX> continued with the resignation of company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaBonte </ENAMEX>'s departure follows by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Goldston</ENAMEX> as senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief marketing officer</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only 11 months</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> .
     The resignations by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , considered hard-charging and abrasive by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> , reflect a difference in style with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Fireman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , according to several former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are among a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> recruited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> to help it make the transition from a small start-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to a marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> with sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.79 billion</NUMEX> .
     The changes come as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> , which grew rapidly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nike Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.A.

     The departures , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Ruth</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Montgomery Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , should enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to focus on business issues instead of management differences .
     `` I think it 's more an issue of style .
     I would view it as a net positive .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can go about its business .

     A former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that grows as fast as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> did , it is going to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> coming and going .

     Magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers</ENAMEX> are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles .
     But even a raft of recent failures is n't stopping them from launching new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publications</ENAMEX> .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Magazine Conference</ENAMEX> here , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publishers</ENAMEX> are plenty worried about the industry 's woes .
     But they are also talking about new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telemedia Inc.</ENAMEX> will publish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eating Well</ENAMEX> , a new food and health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next summer</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst Corp.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> plans to publish its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">9 Months</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> for expectant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> , and has already launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Home</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> is developing a spinoff of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> , on the heels of its successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sports Illustrated</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past four years</TIMEX> , the number of consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> has increased by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Kummerfeld</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Magazine Publishers of America </ENAMEX>.
     `` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> industry , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kummerfeld</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> do n't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry . ''
     And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> , advertising pages in consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> tracked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Publishers Information Bureau</ENAMEX> increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> from the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125,849</NUMEX> pages .
     Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.6 billion</NUMEX> .
     Though for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> categories a tough advertising climate persists , the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry .
     Though some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> are thriving , the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> closed down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">In Fashion</ENAMEX> , a once-promising young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drake Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> has folded the long-troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> has announced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">17 years</TIMEX> , will no longer carry advertising as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lang</ENAMEX> is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> with only subscription revenue .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Health Partners</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Health</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , is deep in debt , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Lipstein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , is being forced to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reader 's Digest Association Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> said in a telephone interview from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> that the sale was proceeding as planned .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> is strong .
     It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> said .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Magazines</ENAMEX> can no longer be considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Autry </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX> 's magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Publishers</ENAMEX> will find that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> have served their purpose and should die , '' he added .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Magazines</ENAMEX> could , like other brands , find that they have only a limited life . ''
     There are also indications that the number of magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling .
     More than ever , independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> and small publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> are being gobbled up by larger publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Publishing Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conde Nast Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advance Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> are still active , though .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Ritterman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Network Publishing Corp.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> sold his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soap Opera Digest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritterman</ENAMEX> said that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next six months</TIMEX> he will take <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soap Opera Digest</ENAMEX> sale to acquire new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> .
     He would not reveal which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> he is considering .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1980</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele Sindona</ENAMEX> -- an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1972</TIMEX> had bought a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> block of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> 's stock from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Loews Corp.</ENAMEX> , headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence A. Tisch</ENAMEX> -- was sentenced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">25 years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> after being convicted of fraud and perjury .
     Included was the charge that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sindona</ENAMEX> siphoned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> funds for his other ventures .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sindona</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> faked his `` kidnapping '' for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2 months</TIMEX> to delay his trial . -RRB-
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1976 to 1979</TIMEX> , other former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of violations including phony transactions to hide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's losses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sindona</ENAMEX> , the onetime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vatican</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> with reported links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mafia</ENAMEX> , died on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 22 , 1986</TIMEX> , at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 65</TIMEX> , reportedly after drinking cyanide-laced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> .
     It happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four days</TIMEX> after he was sentenced to life in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> for ordering a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> murder .

     In a nondescript office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated .
     A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with hand-held computers register their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second</TIMEX>-by-<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second</TIMEX> reactions to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> 's remarks .
     Agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can be inferred from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> ' twist of a dial .
     In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Vinson</ENAMEX> , who oversees the experiments , is n't some white-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> .
     He heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest legal consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , which is helping corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> ' reactions .
     In the process , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law .
     Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC</ENAMEX> , employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX> , graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ph. D.s</ENAMEX> .
     Among other services , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">juries</ENAMEX> , coaches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> , and designs courtroom graphics .
     Much like their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> in political consulting and product marketing , the litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> encourage their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify their messages and provide their target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> with a psychological craving to make the desired choice .
     With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice .
     Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil Co.</ENAMEX> win a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.5 billion</NUMEX> jury verdict against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco Inc</ENAMEX> .
     It advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Football League</ENAMEX> in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">the United States Football League</ENAMEX> .
     And it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Firestone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">500</ENAMEX> tires to the anti-nausea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Bendectin</ENAMEX> .
     Largely as a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> has more than doubled in size in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> .
     Its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> revenue was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> are being spawned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">almost daily</TIMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 300</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> -- many just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> -- have sprung up .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> estimates the industry 's total revenues approach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> .
     In any high-stakes case , you can be sure that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> .
     Despite their ubiquity , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> are n't entirely welcome .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> see the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> ' vision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen .
     In the film classic `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Twelve Angry Men</ENAMEX> , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juror</ENAMEX> 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of conflict and debate , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity .
     In real life , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> may not always work that way , but some court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to .
     Litigation consulting is , as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Zoeller</ENAMEX> puts it , `` highly manipulative . ''
     He adds , `` The notion they try to sell is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">juries</ENAMEX> do n't make decisions rationally .
     But the effort is also being made to try and cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> not to decide things rationally .
     I find it troubling . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoeller</ENAMEX> also acknowledges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> can be very effective .
     `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says .
     Others complain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> wealthy enough to afford such pricey services .
     `` The affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> can buy it , the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amitai Etzioni</ENAMEX> , a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> who teaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">George Washington University</ENAMEX> .
     Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970s</TIMEX> before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Harrisburg 7 trial</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Berrigan</ENAMEX> and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .
     In that case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of left-leaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX> interviewed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252</NUMEX> registered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Harrisburg</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Episcopalians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Presbyterians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Methodists</ENAMEX> and fundamantalist <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Protestants</ENAMEX> were nearly always against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> resolved to try to keep them off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> .
     The defense also learned that college-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were uncharacteristically conservative about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> .
     A more blue-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> became a second aim .
     Ultimately , that carefully picked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> deadlocked with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> vote to acquit , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecution</ENAMEX> decided not to retry the case .
     Litigation consulting had arrived .
     The fledgling science went corporate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> hired a marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> to help defend a complex antitrust case .
     The problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Barr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boies</ENAMEX> was how to make such a highly technical case understandable .
     As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> was keeping up with them .
     The solution devised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> was to hire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who would mirror the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> demographically , sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him .
     He then briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Messrs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> , who had the chance to tilt their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next day</TIMEX> 's presentation accordingly .
     Thus , the `` shadow '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> was born .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> , got the law bug and formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> won the case . -RRB-
     `` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cravath , Swaine &amp; Moore</ENAMEX> .
     `` What you look for in a shadow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and get some response to it .
     A shadow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ''
     The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Energy Transportation Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> over the transport of semi-liquefied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> , at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow .
     Just before the actual closing arguments , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> put the case to a vote of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> shadow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> , each of whom was being paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150</NUMEX> a day .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Energy Transportation</ENAMEX> , and awarded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> in damages .
     The real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> returned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days later</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 345 million</NUMEX> victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Energy Transportation .</ENAMEX>
     `` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Energy Transportation</ENAMEX> trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Reasoner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vinson &amp; Elkins</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> rain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> . ''
     Forecasting is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> ' work .
     Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters .
     And to the uninitiated , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative .
     Theoretically , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively .
     Instead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> says , interviews with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views .
     Pre-trial polling helps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> develop a profile of the right type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juror</ENAMEX> .
     If it is a case in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are far more likely to grant them .
     Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">deli</ENAMEX> would be ideal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> advises .
     So would someone recently divorced or widowed .
     -LRB- Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> generally represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defense</ENAMEX> , its job is usually to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> identify and remove such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     For personal-injury cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> seeks defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> who believe that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , get what they deserve .
     Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> help the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> find such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> by asking questions about potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> does n't make moral distinctions .
     If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> needs prejudiced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> will help find them .
     As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> explains it , `` We do n't control the facts .
     They are what they are .
     But any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> will select the facts and the strategy to employ .
     In our system of advocacy , the trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . ''
     Once a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> is selected , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> often continue to determine what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' presentation accordingly .
     Logic plays a minimal role here .
     More important are what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LSI</ENAMEX> calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> on a gut level .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> personal-injury case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pool</ENAMEX> , but the fall did n't explain why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of her arms was discolored bluish .
     By repeatedly drawing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> 's attention to the arm , the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> planted doubt about the origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's injuries .
     The ploy worked .
     The defense won .
     In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> concentrate on encouraging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> to shift the blame .
     `` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> to hold the accident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> responsible for his or her plight , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> has written .
     Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> ' operation .
     Studies show , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> say , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually .
     Computer-generated videos help .
     `` The average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> watches <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven hours</TIMEX> of TV a day .
     They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LSI</ENAMEX> graphics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Seltzer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have always employed similar tactics .
     `` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Gillers</ENAMEX> , a legal ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">New York University</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     `` What you have here is intuition made manifest . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence .
     Others point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage .
     Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> concedes that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions .
     A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> offer horror stories of jobs botched by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> or of overpriced services -- as when one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> paid a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> -LRB- not at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Litigation Sciences</ENAMEX> -RRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70,000</NUMEX> to interview a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The American Lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> .
     Some litigators scoff at the notion that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> knows more than they do about what makes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> tick .
     `` The essence of being a trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> is understanding how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Ostrager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett</ENAMEX> , who recently won a huge case on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Oil Co .</ENAMEX>
     He says he used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . ''
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> accept that the marketplace has spoken .
     And the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a decade</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etzioni</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> , has been a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs</ENAMEX> .
     `` There 's no reason to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">juries</ENAMEX> rule inappropriately , '' he says .
     `` But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better .
     What you then do is you make them think inappropriately . ''
     To hamper the work of litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> , he suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> sharply limit the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> can remove from the jury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> through so-called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do n't require explanations .
     In most civil cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> allow each side <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> such challenges .
     For complex cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> sometimes allow many more .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etzioni</ENAMEX> also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> release names and addresses , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> can drive by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> , look up credit ratings , and even question <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     Furthermore , he says , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> should not be allowed to analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> ' personalities .
     Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> who have used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> to their advantage see a need to limit their impact .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to use Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinson</ENAMEX> 's services , cautions against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> ' allowing extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> .
     `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boies</ENAMEX> says .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics Inc.</ENAMEX> , a fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of computer workstations , said it landed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> federal government contracts worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> award is part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> contract to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers</ENAMEX> and could be valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     The other involves the sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's high-end workstations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> .
     The models , which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 75,000</NUMEX> each , will be used in research .
     The awards are evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of powerful desktop computers , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's on a roll , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Herwick</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht &amp; Quist</ENAMEX> .
     `` No other -LCB- computer -RCB- vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price . ''
     In the battle to supply desktop computers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> , most of the attention is given to the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> , which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , has targeted a specific niche since its inception in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , which has been dubbed by some as `` motion-picture computing . ''
     This is a style of `` visual '' computing that provides three-dimensional , color models of everything from the inside of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> to the latest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> 's fashion .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> is much smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital , Hewlett and Sun</ENAMEX> , it has emerged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has made it tough on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> introduced a model priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,000</NUMEX> -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future .
     `` It 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 % to 40 %</NUMEX> a year , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward McCracken</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Silicon Graphics</ENAMEX> ' strategy seems to be paying off .
     Revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 86.4 million</NUMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> increase over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .
     Profit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.2 million</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago quarter</TIMEX> .

     Remember those bulky , thick-walled refrigerators of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> ?
     They , or at least something less efficient than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's thin-walled units , may soon be making a comeback .
     That something , whatever it is , could add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 100</NUMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 600</NUMEX> or so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> now pay for lower-priced refrigerators .
     These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">solvents</ENAMEX> are in prospect because of something called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Montreal Protocol</ENAMEX> , signed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">products</ENAMEX> with an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 135 billion</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     World-wide production would be cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX> liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> .
     Not to be outdone , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> wants <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> banished altogether by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> , a goal endorsed at an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX> environmental meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Helsinki</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring</TIMEX> .
     That 's a lot of banishment , as it turns out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> are the primary ingredient in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> , often referred to by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> trade name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Freon</ENAMEX> , which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">agent</ENAMEX> in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Gases</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> are pumped into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyurethane</ENAMEX> to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">foam</ENAMEX> used in pillows , upholstery and insulation .
     Polyurethane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">foam</ENAMEX> is a highly efficient insulator , which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days</TIMEX> when they were insulated with glass <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fiber</ENAMEX> .
     But even though by some estimates it might cost the world <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 100 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between now and the year 2000</TIMEX> to convert to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">coolants</ENAMEX> , foaming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">solvents</ENAMEX> and to redesign equipment for these less efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">substitutes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Montreal Protocol</ENAMEX> 's legions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> say it is worth it .
     They insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays .
     Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Teagan</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in heat transfer , is running a project at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur D. Little Inc.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> .
     In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> 's generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> through increased combustion of fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fuels</ENAMEX> is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time .
     `` I would be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teagan</ENAMEX> .
     `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently .
     But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in .
     We ca n't afford to wait . ''
     But does it have to be so soon ?
     Some atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> think that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 %</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the middle of the next century</TIMEX> .
     It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
     It is generally agreed that when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> rise from earth to stratosphere , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorine</ENAMEX> in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ozone</ENAMEX> .
     But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture .
     The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure .
     What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have known since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">the late 1970s</ENAMEX> is that there is a hole in the layer over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Antarctica</ENAMEX> that expands or contracts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> .
     But it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Antarctica</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems , running for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> without either the CFC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> or the insulation ever escaping .
     Another argument of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> is that if substitutes are available , why not use them ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teagan</ENAMEX> cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Butane</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">propane</ENAMEX> can be used as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">coolants</ENAMEX> , for example , but are flammable .
     Moreover , new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">lubricants</ENAMEX> will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations , which , as with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> , are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">solvents</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teagan</ENAMEX> points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> is less efficient than current devices , energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Folks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> who just suffered a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it , but let 's not be flippant about grave risks .
     As it happens , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX> is not at all interested in throwing cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> on ozone depletion and global warming theories .
     It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> .
     There is , after all , big money in environmentalism .
     Maybe we should ask why it was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Freon</ENAMEX> , introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1930</TIMEX> , revolutionized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> answer is that big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> , as it happens , has a potential substitute for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">CFCs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Chemical Industries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> also has one , and is building a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> to produce it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course .
     There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise .
     Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it .
     University <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . ''
     They needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts .
     In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few .
     That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency .
     There is an element of make-work involved .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap .
     But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive .

     but worries about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     With most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislatures</ENAMEX> adjourned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , small business is tallying its scorecard .
     Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans .
     While results were mixed in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don L. Robinson</ENAMEX> , associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX> , the largest small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Rhode Island ,</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> were defeated .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> 's rate will rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.75</NUMEX> an hour , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's highest , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1 , 1991</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> 's will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> highest -- at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.65</NUMEX> an hour in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1992</TIMEX> -- but small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> won an exclusion for tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> and a lower training rate .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small-business count shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> bills mandating health coverage or parental leave .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Illinois Legislature</ENAMEX> narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thompson</ENAMEX> vetoed , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> amended laws to require that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> pay for breast-cancer exams .
     Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     `` Those kinds of issues always keep coming back , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Beckwith</ENAMEX> , who manages the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> 's small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     DESPITE VICTORIES <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , small business fears losing parental-leave war .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> joined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> others requiring private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> to grant leaves of absence to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with newborn or adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> .
     Similar proposals were defeated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 15</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     But small business , which generally detests government-mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes .
     `` It 's just a matter of time before the tide turns , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Midwestern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> .
     Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; they favor a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">commission</ENAMEX> that would develop sample leave policies that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> could adopt .
     They also support a tax credit for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> to offset the cost of hiring and training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who temporarily replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on parental leave .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , the issue is expected to be especially close in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Buente</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFIB</ENAMEX> .
     IN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX> , more small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> ponder adopting a child-care policy .
     Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> with a stated policy on child care for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">under $ 25,000</NUMEX> and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">NOVEMBER</TIMEX> BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 million</NUMEX> downtown baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business .
     But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , small business generally opposes an initiative to boost spending on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's programs by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 360 million</NUMEX> , fearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8 %</NUMEX> sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">CALIFORNIA</ENAMEX> , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy .
     With some new rules , state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchises</ENAMEX> whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts .
     Previously , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> insisted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisers</ENAMEX> pre-register such changes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> -- a costly process taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least six weeks</TIMEX> .
     Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisers</ENAMEX> no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees</ENAMEX> who qualify as `` sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> . ''

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> consider the changes regressive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis G.

     He argues <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 400,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> trying to find their way through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">subways</ENAMEX> , sat in traffic jams on major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeways</ENAMEX> or waited forlornly for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">buses</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     In other words , it was a better-than-average <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> commute .
     City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> feared widespread gridlock on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first day</TIMEX> that normal business operations were resumed following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake .
     The massive temblor , which killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , severed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">artery</ENAMEX> to the east , and closed most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">ramps</ENAMEX> leading to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Highway 101</ENAMEX> , the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">artery</ENAMEX> to the south .
     It will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several weeks</TIMEX> to repair the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several months</TIMEX> to repair some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">101</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">connections</ENAMEX> .
     But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> subway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">system</ENAMEX> carried <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> than normal .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in memory , it was standing-room only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BART</ENAMEX> 's sleek , modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">railcars</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> still connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bay</ENAMEX> did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to come in at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">odd hours</TIMEX> , or that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are still staying at home .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> who normally drove across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , which is shut down for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several weeks</TIMEX> because of damage to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">span</ENAMEX> , actually may have reached work a bit faster on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BART</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , provided they could find a parking space at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">system</ENAMEX> 's jammed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stations</ENAMEX> .
     In the best of times , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 to 30 minutes</TIMEX> or more .
     Not that getting into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> was easy .
     Storm flooding caused back-ups on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> had to find rides to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BART</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stations</ENAMEX> , because parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lots</ENAMEX> were full before dawn .
     Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Sullivan</ENAMEX> .
     Her commute from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Petaluma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , normally takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and 15 minutes</TIMEX> , via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> , which connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">North Bay</ENAMEX> area .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , she was still waiting at a bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stop</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> , trying to transfer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> going to the financial district .
     `` It 's worse than I thought , '' she said .
     `` I do n't know where all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">buses</ENAMEX> are . ''
     But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> , by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a.m.</TIMEX> it already had thinned out .
     `` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Catania</ENAMEX> , an insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mill Valley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Marin County</ENAMEX> .
     `` It looks like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a holiday</TIMEX> .
     I think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got scared and stayed home . ''
     However , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's absenteeism at the bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was no greater than on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an average day</TIMEX> .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">San Mateo Bridge</ENAMEX> , which connects the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> peninsula with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bay</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
     `` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Perez</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Highway Patrol</ENAMEX> .
     There were many indications that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the new work hours</TIMEX> implemented by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> played a big role .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> handled as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> as normally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , but over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> rather than the usual <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> crush .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bechtel Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , the giant closely held engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , says it has instituted a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m. to 8 p.m.</TIMEX> flextime arrangement , whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> may select any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-hour</TIMEX> period during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">those hours</TIMEX> to go to work .
     Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bechtel</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,000</NUMEX> work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of them commuting from stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bay</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</ENAMEX> is offering its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tier flextime schedule -- either<TIMEX TYPE="TIME"> 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m. to 6 p.m .</TIMEX>
     The flextime may cut by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a third</NUMEX> the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PG&amp;E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> working conventional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9-5 hours</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> may opt for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a four-day workweek</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 hours</TIMEX> a day , to cut the commute by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX> , flextime is left up to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working groups</ENAMEX> , because some of the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> must be on-site during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal business hours</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> says .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock .
     One senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bechtel</ENAMEX> said he got up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 a.m.</TIMEX> to drive into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bay</ENAMEX> .
     But transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
     Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> who did n't use car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> were committing `` an anti-social act , '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> were alone , compared with the normal <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> rate .
     And some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry Kasparov</ENAMEX> went to combat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can .
     Playing black in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> game , the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> maneuvered <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Deep Thought</ENAMEX> , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position .
     Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack .
     And in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> game , with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> advancing ferociously as white , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .
     Well , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> can rest easier for now .
     Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">26-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> to beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected .
     And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> strode into the playing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hall</ENAMEX> , he called the outcome .
     As if he were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron Mike</ENAMEX> , about to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ring</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">98-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weakling</ENAMEX> , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five years</TIMEX> . ''
     His strategy against <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> was based on a thorough study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmasters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bent Larsen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Denmark</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrne</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> was underwhelmed .
     `` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> apparently was not worried at all about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's strong points .
     Its chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feng-hsiung Hsu</ENAMEX> , nicknamed his brainchild `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">the Weasel</ENAMEX> '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hall</ENAMEX> , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">New York Academy of Art</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> never left home , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Carnegie Mellon University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , but communicated with its human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handlers</ENAMEX> by telephone link .
     They conceded that the odds favored Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> , but they put their hope in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> per second , from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">720,000</NUMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handlers</ENAMEX> mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">kryptonite</ENAMEX> .
     This became apparent as game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Sicilian</ENAMEX> Defense by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> , proceeded .
     No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX> can examine millions of moves , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .
     After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Short</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain</ENAMEX> fought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> to a draw in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     But the computer did n't play Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
     Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> made a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-rate rook maneuver at move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ; then it put a knight offside on move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> , and computers , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmar Mednis</ENAMEX> , the expert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> for the match , which was attended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of chess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> .
     By move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> had fallen into a deep positional trap .
     It allowed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> to exchange his dark-squared bishop for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's knights .
     Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> was left with a very dangerous knight and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity .
     Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> snidely put it .
     Consistently , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form .
     When most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of a pawn down .
     Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> would have -- prompting more derision .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
     He also launched a kingside storm , sacrificing a pawn to denude <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's king .
     No amount of weasling could have saved this game for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T .</ENAMEX>
     A piece down , the computer resigned .
     Now , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> in the analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> smelling figurative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">blood</ENAMEX> , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> could win game <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     With the advantage of playing white -LRB- which moves <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> -RRB- , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted .
     As early as move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight .
     This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development .
     `` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> said later .
     In such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . ''
     After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 11</NUMEX> moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky .
     Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack .
     And when a defensive move was called for , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> remarked later that `` even a weak club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> '' would have avoided the queen move .
     Now , after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a dozen</NUMEX> moves , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> were looking for a mating combination .
     On a demonstration board , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emcee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelby Lyman</ENAMEX> showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> refuted this line of play .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
     He won <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's queen for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> minor pieces and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , to give the computer much hope .
     In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37th</NUMEX> move .
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX> , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     `` In both games I got exactly what I wanted , '' he said .
     What he had demonstrated , he added , is that there 's more to chess than sheer calculation .
     Undeterred , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">D.T.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handlers</ENAMEX> vowed to press on .
     Indeed , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them will be building a successor machine for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp</ENAMEX> .
     Promises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feng-hsiung Hsu</ENAMEX> : `` In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> we 'll mount a better challenge . ''

     Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in .
     Just ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1986</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 40,000</NUMEX> for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 9 %</NUMEX> .
     `` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> recalls .
     Yields on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> CDs at major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> were averaging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.45 %</NUMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes were paying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 8 %</NUMEX> .
     The CD seemed like a great deal .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nearly 3 1\/2 years later</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> says the investment is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 43,000</NUMEX> -- an amount that represents an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just over 2 %</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40,000</NUMEX> .
     The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD .
     Instead , his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> put him in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
     The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's return .
     More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
     Because the CD had an effective yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.4 %</NUMEX> when it was issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value .
     Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> that issued the CD is insolvent , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
     The tip-off came when he opened a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> .
     Several phone calls and a visit to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> found out that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9,000</NUMEX> drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
     `` This is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
     He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 100,000</NUMEX> , '' he adds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> is n't unique .
     Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to get yields they have come to expect , too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .
     `` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Markese</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Association of Individual Investors</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` The biggest problem we have is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying .
     He says that he knew he was getting a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> security sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> .
     But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> never fully explained the risks .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Beairsto</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morristown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , refuses to discuss the matter with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> , referring inquiries to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> with their confirmation of sale .
     The fact sheet , dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1986</TIMEX> , says on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... .
     Computations involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
     `` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says .
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> has agreed that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> that issued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> 's CD , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peoples Heritage Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salina</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan.</ENAMEX> , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> would cover the premium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> paid .
     -LRB- Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     `` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Disposti</ENAMEX> , a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` There 's a question whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> at the time were fully aware '' of the risks .
     `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> says it 's impossible to estimate how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> 's situation , although it says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> now provides credit rating information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 trillion</NUMEX>-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 10</NUMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> currently issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs .
     Still , there are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several billion dollars</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding .
     Because of the tax consequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's education .
     Most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs are in maturities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six to nine years</TIMEX> , and they usually double in value by maturity .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> that issued the CDs failed .
     However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
     Whatever the case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> emphasizes , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> at a lower rate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenfeld</ENAMEX> says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
     And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself .
     No one else will watch out for you .
