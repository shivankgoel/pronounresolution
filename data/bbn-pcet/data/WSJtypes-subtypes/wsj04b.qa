     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunmen</ENAMEX> entered a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maryland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> , ordered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> fled with less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> .
     Describing this and other grisly killings , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom Thurmond</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C .</ENAMEX> -RRB- recently urged fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> to revive a broad federal death penalty .
     `` The ultimate punishment , '' he declared , `` will protect the law-abiding from the vicious , cruel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who commit these crimes . ''
     There 's just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> problem : The law that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maryland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> murders and almost all other killings .
     Most murders are state crimes , so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance .
     Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> , after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation , have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">before the end of the year</TIMEX> -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing .
     Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> concede that there is probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure .
     The pending bill , introduced by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> , would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> , the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> permitted resurrection of such laws , if they meet certain procedural requirements .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">juries</ENAMEX> would have to consider specific `` aggravating '' and `` mitigating '' factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death .
     Since that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> ruling , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have reintroduced the death penalty .
     But congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> invalidated .
     Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> bill would also add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> new crimes punishable by death , including murder for hire .
     -LRB- Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> passed a bill permitting execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who kill <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> abroad . -RRB-
     Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue , one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty , on top of existing state laws , would deter any would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , it 's unlikely that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed .
     Most of the crimes incorporated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death .
     In fact , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> bill had been in effect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past three years</TIMEX> , according to a study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> .
     The last federal execution before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> ruling banning the death penalty took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963</TIMEX> , meaning that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> did n't exercise its execution authority for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years</TIMEX> .
     `` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DEA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Customs</ENAMEX> work together '' on drug enforcement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> acknowledge that few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would be executed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thurmond</ENAMEX> bill , but they contend that is n't the point . `` Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from the commission of capital crimes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Executions , regardless of how frequently they occur , are also `` proper retribution '' for heinous crimes , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> argues .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Boyd</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> may result in a jump in capital sentences , though that has n't happened so far .
     In addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> , this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate .
     Before the bill left committee , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass .</ENAMEX> -RRB- attached an amendment that would allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner .
     The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> , who complained that it would `` kill '' capital punishment .
     A large number of studies suggest that state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">juries</ENAMEX> have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important ways .
     It would allow all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past</TIMEX> .
     And it would shift the burden to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities . `` That burden is very difficult , if not impossible , to meet , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> .
     `` How do you prove a negative ? ''
     Since most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> explains .
     At least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> major studies purport to show that particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> , and against black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> compared with white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> question the validity of the studies and note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> amendment would , in effect , legislate around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Burr</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</ENAMEX> 's capital-punishment defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> failed to get his amendment incorporated into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's anti-drug legislation , and it will be severely attacked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> floor this time around .
     But if it survives , it could prompt other statutory changes , according to the Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burr</ENAMEX> .
     It might force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> who torture their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , perhaps .
     Narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has .
     And that , in turn , would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances .

     Nothing was going to hold up the long-delayed settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britton</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomasini</ENAMEX> .
     Not even an earthquake .
     On the afternoon of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 17</TIMEX> , after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of haggling with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> insurance-claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> over settling a toxic-waste suit , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> had an agreement in hand .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas M.

     The walls shook ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> rocked .
     For a while , it looked like the deal -- not to mention the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">courtroom</ENAMEX> itself -- was on the verge of collapse . `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> came out and said , ` Quick , let 's put this on the record , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Bettencourt</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> 's court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> .
     `` I said , ` <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">NOW</TIMEX> ? '
     I was shaking the whole time . ''
     A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">10-gallon</NUMEX> water cooler had toppled onto the floor , soaking the red carpeting .
     Lights flickered on and off ; plaster dropped from the ceiling , the walls still shook and an evacuation alarm blared outside .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> climbed out from under a table . `` Let 's close the door , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> as he climbed to his bench .
     At stake was an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80,000</NUMEX> settlement involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> , where underground fuel tanks had leaked and contaminated the soil .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> were just as eager as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> to wrap it up . `` We were never going to get these insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to agree again , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John V.

     Indeed , the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> had already bolted out of the courtroom .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> went to work anyway , duly noting that the proceeding was taking place during a major earthquake .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten minutes</TIMEX> later , it was done .

     Applause for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sometimes , Talk Is the Best Medicine</ENAMEX> , '' in your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 5</TIMEX> Marketplace section .
     Indeed , the `` art of doctoring '' does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation .
     Elaborating on the concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> ' sacrificing earnings in order to spend `` talk time '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> , we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport .
     Even brief conversations can show caring and trust , and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> 's earnings .
     The issue is far-reaching .
     Right now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> is spending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</NUMEX> of our gross national product on health care .
     That amounts to more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 billion</NUMEX> a year .
     And it is estimated that more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of that , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 billion</NUMEX> , goes to `` defensive medicine '' -- those measures taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities .
     So we all stand to benefit if patient-physician relations become a `` partnership . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee A.

     In an interview with the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Automotive News</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iacocca</ENAMEX> declined to say which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> will close or when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> will make the moves .
     But he said , `` we have too many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> in our system .
     So the older or most inefficient capacity has got to go . ''
     According to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> most likely to close are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">St. Louis No. 1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> , which builds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">LeBaron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Daytona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toledo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which dates back to the early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1900s</TIMEX> ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> that build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Wrangler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> 's full-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> has had to temporarily close the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toledo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> model preview last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Motors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Lutz</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 3</NUMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , along with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> , might be forced to `` realign ... capacity '' if market demand does n't improve .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iacocca</ENAMEX> 's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> could be in jeopardy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> has signaled that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as five</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> may not survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity .
     The overcapacity problem has intensified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , with foreign auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> beginning car and truck production in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> running so-called transplant auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> auto production in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> will reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     `` Unless the market goes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> -- which we all know it 's not going to do -- we have the inescapable fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">transplants</ENAMEX> are adding capacity , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lutz</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>-managed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> eventually will have the capacity to build some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and that will translate into `` market share that is going to have to come out of somebody , '' he added .
     Already <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> has closed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kenosha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wis.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> it acquired when it bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> has also launched a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> cost-cutting program that will cut <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,300</NUMEX> white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from the payroll in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few months</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco D.S. Inc.</ENAMEX> , the drugstore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> that filed for bankruptcy-court protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , received a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 925 million</NUMEX> offer from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 260 million</NUMEX> of new debt to the highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     It was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> 's huge debt from its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> leveraged buy-out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> that forced it to seek protection under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> insists that the proposal is simply an `` expression of interest , '' because under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> has `` exclusivity rights '' until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Feb. 28</TIMEX> .
     Those rights prevent anyone other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> from proposing a reorganization plan .
     Also under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .
     A financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Schulte</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Partners</ENAMEX> , had mixed reactions to the offer .
     He said he feared a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> reorganization might force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 's offer would give them more money .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is offering to pay off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> in cash only -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 260.5 million</NUMEX> -- and no equity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> bonds are high-yield , high-risk `` junk '' bonds ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> in claims against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> received the offer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 20</TIMEX> , but issued a response <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> only after a copy of the proposal was made public by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acadia Partners Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> that includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robert M. Bass Group</ENAMEX> , made the proposal .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second-largest</NUMEX> drugstore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> was a valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , despite its financial woes .
     Its problem , they say , is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 515 million</NUMEX> debt load is keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> in the red . `` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Stein</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pharmacies</ENAMEX> : The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will boost demand for prescription drugs .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> 's parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anac Holding Corp.</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reported a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.2 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the fiscal first quarter</TIMEX> , compared with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.9 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier quarter</TIMEX> .
     Sales were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 597.8 million</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Twinsburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.2 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.1 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acadia Partners</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bass Group</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable Life Assurance Society</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The offer consists of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 410.5 million</NUMEX> in cash and the rest in notes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acadia</ENAMEX> would sell up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the equity in the reorganized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> in exchange for the cash distribution , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> would receive no discount for their shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boake A. Sells</ENAMEX> , said both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has been made since negotiations began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> .
     He said he has not met with representatives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acadia</ENAMEX> .
     Any reorganization proposal , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sells</ENAMEX> said , is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> in claims outstanding .
     `` It 's not like the board can decide '' by itself , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sells</ENAMEX> said , adding , `` we 're indifferent to -LRB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> -RRB- plan .
     We just want a plan that satisfies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and at the end leaves a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revco</ENAMEX> was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal .
     `` They want to pretend it does n't exist , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> , who met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acadia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 10</TIMEX> , said , `` It 's certainly a responsible offer .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Copper</ENAMEX> futures prices failed to extend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's rally .
     Declines came because of concern that demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> may slow down .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract was down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three cents</NUMEX> a pound , settling at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1280</NUMEX> , which was just above the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> 's low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1270</NUMEX> .
     Futures prices fell during <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sessions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , and the losses , individually and cumulatively , were greater than the advances .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the major factors buoying prices , the prolonged strikes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , were finally resolved .
     Also , the premiums paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> on a purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Mint</ENAMEX> were lower than expected , and acted as a price depressant , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">mint</ENAMEX> purchases were at premiums <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 4 1\/2 cents</NUMEX> a pound above the respective prices for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> .
     At the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> were asking for premiums of about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> a pound .
     All this has led to prolonged selling in futures , mostly on the part of computer-guided funds .
     Prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas , which added to the selling .
     The reluctance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply .
     At least one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> noted that as production improves , the concern among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> is whether the prospective increased supply will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> because of uncertainty over national economies .
     `` Demand from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is expected to continue strong , but not from other areas of the world into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> normally depends heavily on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bougainville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> .
     Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has been buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> elsewhere .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> begin operating , they are expected to resume their roles as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suppliers</ENAMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Demler</ENAMEX> , metals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> has already started operating and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> is expected to do so soon . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bougainville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> is generally expected to remain closed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     It has n't been operating since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 15</TIMEX> because of attacks by native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> .
     A recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> disregarded a potential production disruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Chile</ENAMEX> and a continued drop in inventories .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chilean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Los Bronces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">El Soldado</ENAMEX> , which belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minera Disputado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , will vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> on whether to strike after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a two-year</TIMEX> labor pact ends <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> produced a total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">110,000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> , the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly , which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said that , if there was any concern , it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Chile</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> copper inventories fell <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">550 tons</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">83,950 tons</NUMEX> , a smaller-than-expected decline .
     But that development also had little effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' sentiment .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> said that stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> ' hands at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of September</TIMEX> were down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">16,000 metric tons</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">30,000 tons</NUMEX> .
     Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , he said , producer stocks at the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">273,000 tons</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">3,000 tons</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of July</TIMEX> .

     In other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> :
     GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
     The prices of most corn , soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> drought .
     Buying by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> has helped to prop up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> , but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">COFFEE</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract ended with a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.29 cents</NUMEX> a pound at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74.35 cents</NUMEX> .
     According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , prices opened higher because of reports over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Pan-American</ENAMEX> summit meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> , had agreed to a reduction in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">coffee</ENAMEX> export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement .
     The reports , attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of economic development , said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> would give up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> bags of its quota and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> bags , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , who said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> was n't involved in any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> discussions on quotas , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> was said to have referred to a letter that he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgilio Barco</ENAMEX> , and in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first half of next year</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     PRECIOUS METALS :

     The market turned quiet after rising sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> , according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> triggered a flight to safety , he said , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> the market lacked such stimuli .
     There was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance , he said .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling , as well , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .

     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> passed laws on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ' rights in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1987</TIMEX> and on self-managing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">cooperatives</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year later</TIMEX> , some Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">observers</ENAMEX> assumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> had launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy .
     Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest .
     These fears were clearly apparent when , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> blocked a speech by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX> , deputy national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's economic reforms succeeding .
     Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> reshuffle on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , do not suggest that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika .
     Indeed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> strike this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> clearly demonstrated that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> must proceed with economic reform .
     But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
     And has he truly persuaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Communist Party</ENAMEX> to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ?
     An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> program , is that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market .
     For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> to earn a living independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market .
     Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperative</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> must seek permission from the local soviet -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Permission is far from automatic : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">soviets</ENAMEX> have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
     Private dressmaking , for example , is allowed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">republics</ENAMEX> but banned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> ; shoemaking is allowed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> but illegal in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> .
     The controls on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> appeared relatively liberal when first introduced .
     But that changed following a resolution from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> banning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> from operating in some areas of the economy , and permitting activity in others only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> are under contract to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> .
     All independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising , but so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles .
     Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> , among the most successful in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> , are banned from providing general-practitioner services -LRB- their main source of income -RRB- , carrying out surgery , and treating cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> , drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> and pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives : The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> enables the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">soviets</ENAMEX> to set prices for which goods may be sold ; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> bans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> from buying `` industrial and food goods '' from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market , these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless .
     Along with some other revealing indicators , these developments suggest that while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> wishes to move away from some rigid central controls , he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> schools of economic thought .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods .
     He told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress of People 's Deputies</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 30</TIMEX> : `` We do not share this approach , since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> . ''
     Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons , and the market for fear of the social -LRB- political -RRB- consequences , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> seeks a `` <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> way '' that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter .
     Most important , this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed .
     Indeed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> fascism , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> spoke specifically of a `` <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> way '' : of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism .
     They , too , promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline .
     The emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> corporatism had been anticipated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Urban</ENAMEX> 's introduction to a series of colloquies -- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Can the Soviet System Survive Reform ?</ENAMEX> '' -- published this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring</TIMEX> .
     `` Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russo</ENAMEX> -- corporation-socialist in form , nationalistic in content and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness ... . ''
     The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an `` organic '' society in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> were spiritually and morally unified , and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in a fully integrated and `` harmonic '' society .
     The key to the creation of the `` organic '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> lay in the formation of `` natural '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that would undertake the role of decision-making .
     By contrast , a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was held to cause , rather than resolve , conflict .
     The closeness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> was evident when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> presented his economic vision to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Soviet Congress</ENAMEX> .
     In doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market .
     Instead , he proposed a `` law-governed economy , '' in which there would be a `` clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management . ''
     The latter would be undertaken by `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> , joint stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> . ''
     These would not function independently , but would act together to form `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">combines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">associations</ENAMEX> '' to tackle problems and coordinate their activities .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> , who was never able to influence business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pirelli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Soviet Communist Party</ENAMEX> has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it .
     To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> must ensure that within this `` alliance '' the business sector remains subordinate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed .
     It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> and labor .
     The work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> provides the third arm of the `` alliance . ''
     Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force , guarding against excessive control by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> or abuse of its economic position by business , for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards -LRB- under the new resolutions , workers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">councils</ENAMEX> may demand that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">cooperative</ENAMEX> be closed or its prices be reduced -RRB- .
     By providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher , and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> hopes to revive the popularity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism .
     The most important development in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> also suffers from terrorism .
     An increasing number of references by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> press to opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">groups</ENAMEX> now active in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> , particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Democratic Union</ENAMEX> , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims .
     It is possible that , in perpetuating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> on the ground of terrorism .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> would appear to see his central task , however , as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , capital and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo .
     If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system , he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition , and to re-establish control in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is a consummate political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , perhaps one of the greatest -- but in its economic prescription .
     Contrary to widespread belief , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time ; it is doubtful whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-style corporatism will make <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> trains run on time , or fill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> with goods that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> so desperately crave .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston Inc.</ENAMEX> , the holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> of Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's `` aggressive merchant banking risk '' in highly leveraged takeovers .
     In downgrading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> 's subordinated domestic , Euromarket and Swiss debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> is matching a move made by the other major credit rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> also confirmed the Prime-1 rating , its highest , on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> 's commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said it downgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financiere Credit Suisse</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's senior and subordinated Swiss debt to single-A-2 from single-A-1 and lowered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financiere CSFB N.V.</ENAMEX> 's junior subordinated perpetual Eurodebt , guaranteed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financiere Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , to single-A-3 from single-A-2 .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">About $ 550 million</NUMEX> of long-term debt is affected , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> said : `` We remain committed to a full range of businesses , including merchant banking .
     We think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's merchant banking risks mounted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> as highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's most lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">decade</TIMEX> , was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> incurred <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> of losses on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> securities it owned as well as on special securities it could n't sell .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> financings for several other highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX> , unraveled as the high-risk junk bond market plummeted .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said its rating changes actions `` reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> 's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures . ''
     It said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> `` has consistently been one of the most aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in merchant banking '' and that `` a very significant portion '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's profit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has come from merchant banking-related business .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> 's performance , '' the rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said , citing `` continued problems '' from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's exposures to `` various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> '' and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX> .

     The move by the financial information and services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> is a `` response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry , which has been contracting '' since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> 's stock market crash , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> added .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> purchased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , provides price quotations for securities , particularly stocks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> also provides trading and other systems , services for brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , and communications-network services .
     Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">providers</ENAMEX> of financial information , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> , have been under some pressure as the major securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> are discussing formation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> to sell securities-price data .
     The job cuts , to be made in a number of areas at various job levels , are `` a streamlining of operations , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has no immediate plans to close any operations , she said , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house , including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the move is n't directly a response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> 's loss of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Automated Data Processing Inc.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland Athletics</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-game sweep over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> may widen already-sizable losses that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> will incur on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current , final year</TIMEX> of its baseball contract .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> , disrupted by a devastating earthquake and diminished in national interest because both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , is likely to end up as the lowest-rated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this decade</TIMEX> and probably since the event has been broadcast .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> games were seen by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 17 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> homes , a sharp decline from the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.7 %</NUMEX> rating for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> .
     A final ratings tally from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.C. Nielsen Co.</ENAMEX> is due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The sweep by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">A's</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> and home-run <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitters</ENAMEX> dominated the injury-prone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> , will only make things worse for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> , owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Cities\/ABC Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> had been expected to have losses of as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> .
     It is n't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> .
     Had the contest gone a full <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> games , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> could have reaped an extra <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> in ad sales on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> game alone , compared with the ad take it would have received for regular prime-time shows .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> had based its budget for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-game <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> .

     But some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> , in anticipation of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-game sweep , limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> games .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> telecast typically carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> commercials , but by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> was cramming in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> ads to generate extra revenue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's baseball experience may be of interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next season</TIMEX> takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> television contract priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Pilson</ENAMEX> has conceded only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will have a loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> .
     But other industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> contend the losses could reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> and could go even higher if the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> end in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-game romps .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> typically is among the highest-rated sports events on television .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">series</ENAMEX> , broadcast by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> , was the lowest-rated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> ; instead of featuring a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> against a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , it pitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Los Angeles Dodgers</ENAMEX> against the losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Oakland A's</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's hurdle was even higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> from the same area .

     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake .

     Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies , the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound , which gained slightly against the dollar .

     Both are expected to show continued sluggishness , which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about an eighth</NUMEX> of a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.25</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The yield on the issue slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.92 %</NUMEX> .
     The dollar gained .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kawasaki-Rikuso</ENAMEX> , a freight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , set up its own software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and is spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nearly a year</TIMEX> 's profit to more than double the computer terminals at its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Long-Term Credit Bank</ENAMEX> linked its computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> with its three <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> .
     Overall , PC sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first half of 1989</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> higher than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier period</TIMEX> .
     Combined PC and work-station use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> will jump as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> annually over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five years</TIMEX> , according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are concluding that they have no choice . `` We have too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in our home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshio Hatakeyama</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Japan Management Association</ENAMEX> .
     `` Productivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> is relatively low . ''
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> economic army may rattle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> .
     But it also offers opportunities ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are well poised to supply the weapons .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> may be a tough market for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> to penetrate , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is hopelessly behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> in certain technologies .
     But for now , at least , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are far better at making PCs and the software that runs them .
     After years of talking about selling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are seriously pouring in .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> has doubled its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> here over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus Development Corp.</ENAMEX> has slashed the lag between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> product introductions to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six months</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ungermann-Bass Inc.</ENAMEX> has a bigger share of the computer-network market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> than at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have to go a long way to catch up .
     Typical is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Machinery and Information Industries Bureau</ENAMEX> -- the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> overseeing the computer industry .
     `` Personal Computer '' yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk , and dog-eared copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nikkei Computer</ENAMEX> crowd magazine racks .
     But amid the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> sits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> real-life PC .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> PC sales have averaged roughly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> annual growth since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West European</ENAMEX> sales a whopping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> sales were flat for most of that time .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> use PCs at half the rate of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> tend to use computers less efficiently than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> do .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , PCs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , many desktop terminals are limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> function and ca n't communicate with other machines .
     The market planning and sales promotion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX> , for example , has more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> computers for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , a respectable ratio .
     But the machines are n't on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ' desks ; they ring the perimeter of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     Some machines make charts for presentations .
     Others analyze the data .
     To transfer information from one to the other , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> make printouts and enter the data manually .
     To transmit charts to branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> , they use a fax machine .
     Meanwhile , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> sitting next to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator .
     In an efficient setup , the same PC could perform all those tasks .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the PC software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , those functions account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a third</NUMEX> of the software market .
     Machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , are still more common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> than PCs .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of network .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</NUMEX> are linked . `` Computers here are used for data gathering , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger J. Boisvert</ENAMEX> , who manages the integrated-technologies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKinsey & Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , such as securities-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rooms</ENAMEX> , may be ahead of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">counterparts</ENAMEX> , he says , but `` basically , there 's little analysis done on computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> . ''
     Of course , simply buying computers does n't always solve problems , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have erred by purchasing technology they did n't understand .
     But healthy skepticism is only a small reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's PC lag .
     Various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX> `` alphabet '' is so huge , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has no history of typewriter use , and so `` keyboard allergy , '' especially among older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , remains a common affliction . `` I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matsuo Toshimitsu</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">66-year-old</TIMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> , explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> .
     While most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have their own private space , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salarymen</ENAMEX> '' usually share large , common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact .
     Top <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's management system makes it hard to impose a single , integrated computer system corporatewide .
     Besides , a computer processing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese language</ENAMEX> needs a huge memory and much processing capability , while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols .
     Until recently , much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> estimate the average PC costs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> more in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     But the complex language is n't the only reason .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX> has owned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> PC market and ruled it with near-monopoly power .
     With little competition , the computer industry here is inefficient .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , too , is dominated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp .</ENAMEX>
     But early on , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> did , swiftly establishing a standard operating system .
     That spurs competition and growth , allows users to change and mix brands easily , and increases software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of virtually any computer .
     If a record industry lacked a common standard , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> could listen to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Like a Prayer</ENAMEX> '' but not one made for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Panasonic</ENAMEX> player .
     That is the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's computer industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> wo n't release its code , and every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> has its own proprietary operating system -- all incompatible with each other .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> established its standard to try to stop falling behind upstart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> was ahead from the start and did n't need to invite in competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">allies</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> have n't tried to copy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> standard .
     Corporate pride as well as the close ties common among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> help explain why .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> `` have a working relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> , often through cross-licensing of technology , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Japan Personal Computer Software Association</ENAMEX> noted recently .
     `` They hesitate to market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX>-compatible machines ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> disapproves of such machines , and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship . ''
     The result , according to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , is higher prices and less innovation .
     While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of software packages using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> standard are available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , they say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 8,000</NUMEX> are written for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fair Trade Commission</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for discouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> from discounting . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , `` software is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four to five years</TIMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> because hardware is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four to five years</TIMEX> behind , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> is enjoying a monopoly , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazuhiko Nishi</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ascii Corp.</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's leading PC-magazine publishing and software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     `` There are no price wars , no competition . ''
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> responds that prices are higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     She adds that some technological advances trail those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> still import basic operating systems from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     But the market is changing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">government</ENAMEX> is funding several projects to push PC use .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next three years</TIMEX> , public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> will get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</NUMEX> PCs , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-fold</NUMEX> increase from current levels .
     In the private sector , practically every major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is setting explicit goals to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ' exposure to computers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> 's sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-tenth</NUMEX> the computers per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> that its own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> do ; over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next five years</TIMEX> , it is aiming for rough parity .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kao Corp.</ENAMEX> , a major cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , plans to eliminate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> clerical jobs by putting on a central computer network some work , such as credit reports , currently performed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> .
     By increasing the number of PCs it uses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omron Tateishi Electronics Co.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kyoto</ENAMEX> , hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is run .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> have long been those who supervise their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> so orders would be properly acted on , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     `` But new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> will have to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innovators</ENAMEX> ... and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can be reached easily , and also shared . ''
     Meanwhile , more computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> now are competing for the new business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seiko Epson Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newcomer</ENAMEX> to the industry , fought off a legal challenge and started selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     It has won <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> of the retail PC market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> , which temporarily dropped out of the PC business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> , started selling its work station in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and quickly became the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in that market .
     In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> where elbow room is scarce , laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry 's future growth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> busted open that sector this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,500</NUMEX> -RRB- -- one of the smallest , cheapest PCs available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history -- including a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>-guest bash at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyo Dome</ENAMEX> -- for its sophisticated sound\/graphics FM Towns machine , which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke , bar singing .
     Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , most of the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> joined under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> umbrella to adopt a version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> AT standard .
     That has n't generated much sales , but this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> rallied all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> to make their new machines compatible with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> OS\/2 standard .
     A healthy , coherent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> market could also make it far easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to sell overseas , where their share is still minimal .
     But it could also help <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which also are starting to try to open the market .
     As with many other goods , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> share of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's PC market is far below that in the rest of the world .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> have under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> share , compared with half the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> at home .
     Though no formal trade barriers exist , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> computer industry is difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outsiders</ENAMEX> to enter .
     `` If it were an open market , we would have been in in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eckhard Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> , who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , without any major effort , sells more machines in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Although it has opened a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , it is still only `` studying '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> that has n't adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX>-oriented specifications .
     And because general retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">centers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ComputerLand</ENAMEX> have little presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , sales remain in the iron grip of established computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are also to blame .
     They long made little effort here .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , though long a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> mainframe business , did n't introduce its first PC in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years after</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> did , and that was n't compatible even with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> standard .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> did n't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> characters of written <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> -- until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> after entering the market .
     Critics also say <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> charge too much .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC</ENAMEX> says it is investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> for allegedly discouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> from discounting .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are redoubling their efforts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> recently hired its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , luring away an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , as well as a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> top-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">team</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating system and a kanji laser printer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> started selling its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> machine that could run in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and that substantially enhances compatibility with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> products .

     From a reading of the somewhat scant <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English-language</ENAMEX> medical literature on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around .
     This is not only because it kills the unborn , a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient , zapping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 50 % to 85 %</NUMEX> of them depending on which study you read -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> , taken in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> , boosts the rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     By contrast , surgical abortion is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 %</NUMEX> effective .
     Abortion via the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion .
     It is time-consuming -LRB- the abortion part alone lasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> , and the clinical part comprises <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> 's worth of visits -RRB- , bloody -LRB- one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> trial required a transfusion , although for most it resembles a menstrual period , with bleeding lasting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">an average of 10 days</TIMEX> -RRB- , and painful -LRB- many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> require analgesic shots to ease them through -RRB- .
     Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects .
     Timing is of the essence with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> .
     It is most effective taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a week</TIMEX> after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> misses her menstrual period up through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the seventh week</TIMEX> of pregnancy , when it is markedly less effective .
     That is typically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a three-week window</TIMEX> .
     So far , all the studies have concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> is `` safe . ''
     But `` safe , '' in the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Bass</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Reproductive Health Technologies Project</ENAMEX> , means `` there 's been no evidence so far of mortality . ''
     No one has researched the long-term effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's health or fertility .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> seems to suppress ovulation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three to seven months</TIMEX> after it is taken .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again : The studies have reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repeaters</ENAMEX> in their programs .
     But there are no scientific data on this question .
     Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> can cause birth defects , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lancet</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">journal</ENAMEX> , reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etienne-Emile Baulieu</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who invented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> , wrote in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Science</ENAMEX> magazine article <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> , the anti-miscarriage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> that has been linked to cervical and vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who took it .
     All the published studies recommend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> on whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion .
     A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> .
     One might well ask : Why bother with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> at all ?
     Some abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> have been asking themselves this very question . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> `` probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed , or at least not very much , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip Stubblefield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Abortion Federation</ENAMEX> , at a reproductive health conference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding , which occurs even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> fails to induce an abortion .
     It typically takes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight to 10 years</TIMEX> to obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> 's approval for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , and the cost of testing and marketing a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> can range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health and Human Services Department</ENAMEX> currently forbids the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> from funding abortion research as part of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> contraceptive program .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Population Council</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">a 37-year-old</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> that has the backing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mellon</ENAMEX> foundations and currently subsidizes most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> research on contraceptives , has recently been paying for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> on a license from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Roussel-Uclaf</ENAMEX> , a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     In the year since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> went on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> market , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Organization for Women</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">offshoot</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NOW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Smeal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Fund for a Feminist Majority</ENAMEX> , have been trying to browbeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical industry into getting involved .
     -LRB- Its scare-tactic prediction : the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> `` will be available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , either legally or illegally , in no more than 2-5 years . '' -RRB-
     Following the feminist and population-control lead has been a generally bovine press .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1988</TIMEX> article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mother Jones</ENAMEX> magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance .
     `` For a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> whose period is late , using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> means no waiting , no walking past picket lines at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">abortion clinics</ENAMEX> , and no feet up in stirrups for surgery , '' burbles health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Fraser</ENAMEX> .
     `` It also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant . ''
     Wrong on all counts , Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> is being administered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> only under strict supervision in the presence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Roussel</ENAMEX> reportedly has every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> marked and accounted for to make sure none slips into the black market . -RRB-
     Thus , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> to have an abortion would have to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clinic</ENAMEX> past those picket lines ; an initial visit for medical screening -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anemics</ENAMEX> and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated -RRB- and to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trip <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> later for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> , administered either via injection or vaginal suppository , and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> trip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week later</TIMEX> to make sure she has completely aborted .
     Furthermore , because timing is so critical with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> , she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she is pregnant , but just how pregnant she is .
     No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who fears malpractice liability would likely expose a non-pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to the risk of hemorrhaging .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may even see the dead embryo they have expelled , a sight the surgical-abortion industry typically spares them .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seven weeks</TIMEX> , an embryo is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about three-fourths of an inch long</NUMEX> and recognizably human .
     At the behest of pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> reauthorization bill for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title X</ENAMEX> federal family-planning assistance now contains a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> grant for `` development , evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and methods . ''
     If this passes -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> -- it would put the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> into the contraceptive marketing business for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time .
     It also could put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> business , which would please <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private-sector drug industry .
     We do not know whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">RU-486</ENAMEX> will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility-control methods released to unblinking , uncritical cheers from educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who should have known better .
     -LRB- Remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Dalkon Shield</ENAMEX> and the early birth-control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pills</ENAMEX> ? -RRB-
     We will not know until a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation of female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> -- all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job -- has put the abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pill</ENAMEX> through the clinical test of time .

     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> , a major part of our trade deficit went poof !
     No figure juggling ; no witchcraft ; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports .
     The result ?
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , net of imports , were understated by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.9 billion</NUMEX> a year and understated at the annualized rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.4 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of the `` newly found '' net exports were from just a few service-sector categories .
     Some of the biggest service-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exporters</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> financial-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nearly 10 years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of service-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> worked out a plan with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> to improve the data on service-sector exports .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> believed that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of billions of dollars</NUMEX> of service exports -- such as inbound tourism ; legal , accounting and other professional services furnished to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> ; financial , engineering and construction services ; and the like -- were not being counted as exports .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> `` trade deficit '' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> balance-of-payments report , those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services , as well as returns on investments abroad by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and returns on foreign investments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> . -LRB- net after expenditures by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> studying abroad -RRB- , some exports by professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -LRB- a law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> billing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> for services rendered in watching legislation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> is as much an export as shipment of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> jet engine -RRB- , and improved data from travel and tourism .
     In just these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> areas , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 billion</NUMEX> more exports than previously reported and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.6 billion</NUMEX> more imports , with the net result that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> service surplus in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> increased by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.3 billion</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion</NUMEX> .
     Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> net exports that had not previously been recorded was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 billion</NUMEX> a year .
     That means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit was running closer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 billion</NUMEX> than to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- annualized -RRB- rather than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> .
     The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market .
     What does this mean for trade policy ?
     Too early to tell , but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture .
     It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services , but it does suggest that it is our exports of services , and not just borrowing , that is financing our imports of goods .

     Under a merger agreement reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 14</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's expenses out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> funds even if the transaction was n't completed , provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> did n't breach the agreement .

     The merger agreement says the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is entitled to be repaid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.7 million</NUMEX> in fees for its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bankers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> , and its law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison</ENAMEX> .

     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 175</NUMEX> in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> on reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> if they 're interested in cooperating with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> in a new bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .

     Wall Street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> , announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> pulled out of the practice altogether .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's own listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> held an emergency meeting with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> of some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> stock specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialists</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said , were `` livid '' about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are `` here to stay . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market , including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialist</ENAMEX> is an exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">member</ENAMEX> designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> 's meeting with the floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> comes as he prepares to explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> would only say , `` We 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">constituents</ENAMEX> to get their views and ideas on the issue . ''
     The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel Corp.</ENAMEX> said it and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 or more</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's role in program trading .
     The decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> has been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-biggest stock-index arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trader</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> this year , executing an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.1 million</NUMEX> shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a month</TIMEX> in such trades , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one million</NUMEX> shares a day .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> 's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , because the big securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Most Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , in pulling back , have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> has been one of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> executing index arbitrage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading , including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program-driven financial futures .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> , in a statement by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William A. Schreyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel P. Tully</ENAMEX> , said index arbitrage `` has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility , '' so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> wo n't execute such trades until `` effective controls '' are in place .
     In stock-index arbitrage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options .
     The idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Thursday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> was n't as big an index <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arbitrager</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> is .
     Other large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' own accounts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> made an abrupt about-face on program trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , after a special meeting between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> , and its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Just a week ago</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> staunchly defended index arbitrage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> , the most active index-arbitrage trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> on the stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Index arbitrage , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> said big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , which he would n't identify , `` told us they would n't do business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> '' that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts .
     `` We were following the trend of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> who were under pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> so far this year has executed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37.8 million</NUMEX> shares in index-arbitrage trading , and is second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> in overall program trading , which includes index arbitrage .
     Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's program trading is for its own account , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> denied that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Welch</ENAMEX> , had anything to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's decision .
     But at least one chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> said he called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> to complain about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's aggressive use of program trading , and other market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said they understood that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> received many phone calls complaining about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> has generally been sensitive to suggestions that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> makes decisions for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> unit .
     `` Our decision had nothing to do with any pressure Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> received , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> said .
     `` This was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> stand-alone decision . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fairfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , said , `` Absolutely no one spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welch</ENAMEX> on this subject '' and added , `` Anyone who claims they talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welch</ENAMEX> is n't telling the truth . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy , as some did during the post-crash outcry of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage , suggested that the current debate has missed the mark .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> said it continues to believe that `` the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy .
     Indeed , there are legitimate hedging strategies used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> 's index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> will continue to do other kinds of computer-assisted program trading , so there probably wo n't be any layoffs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> 's program operation said .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> and Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan C. Greenberg</ENAMEX> said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> will continue stock-index arbitrage for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's annual meeting last night , he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> that index arbitrage wo n't go away , despite the public outcry .
     `` If they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to quit , they are crazy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> said .
     `` It 's not going to stop it at all . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> , noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market 's volatility , said that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four months</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , stock-index arbitrage had been a `` break-even '' proposition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> .
     In response to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder</ENAMEX> 's suggestion , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     Pressure from big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> has been the major catalyst for Wall Street 's program-trading pullback .
     And there was speculation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> and other large mutual-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> might soon follow the lead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Corp.</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> in cutting off trading business to securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that do program trading .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> denied the speculation , saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem .
     But a much smaller mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAA Investment Management Co.</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , said it informed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> national brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAA</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</NUMEX> mutual fund accounts , manages more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> of which is in the stock market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J.C. Roth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAA</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , called program trading `` mindless . ''
     He said there is `` no valid investment reason '' for stock-index futures to exist .
     A program-bashing move is clearly on .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel</ENAMEX> , who is helping organize the alliance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>-listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , said he had no time to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> because he received so many phone calls , faxes and letters supporting his view that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has been turned into a `` gambling casino '' by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     `` We are reaching the moment of truth '' on Wall Street , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Markey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on telecommunications and finance .
