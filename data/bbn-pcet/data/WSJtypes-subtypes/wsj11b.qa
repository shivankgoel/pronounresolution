     For the real estate industry , a watchword for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> will be buy , more than build .
     That 's the word expected to be on the lips of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> , pension-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> and real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> slated to attend a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-day</TIMEX> conference , beginning here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Urban Land Institute</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">ULI</ENAMEX> is a non-profit research and education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">group</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> nationwide .
     With the market overbuilt , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> are finding limited opportunities and increased risks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Developers</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are looking for bargains among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of financially troubled properties around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> now often bill themselves as `` turnaround <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> '' and `` workout <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> . ''
     Conference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX> are expected to be buzzing about the workings of the recently formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> charged with disposing of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 200 billion</NUMEX> of real estate dumped in government hands by insolvent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loans</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Developers</ENAMEX> are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .
     Some plan to pursue foreign development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> , mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     And other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> may shift from commercial to residential development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     `` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Shaw</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> . ``
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> are saying they will look into distressed properties .
     They 'll go into someone else 's pasture as long as it 's greener than the one they 're in now . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Developers</ENAMEX> are also forming more joint ventures with pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">funds</ENAMEX> and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that can finance big projects .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> are more willing to give up some equity and rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Developers</ENAMEX> are teaming up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> often acting as project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smedes York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">ULI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">York Properties Inc.</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Raleigh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C</ENAMEX> .
     `` They are growing more pragmatic about their role . ''
     Real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are also using their alliances with financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> to amass acquisition funds .
     `` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> , the neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , dealing with traffic mitigation , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">sewers</ENAMEX> and fighting city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hall</ENAMEX> , then try to convince a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lender</ENAMEX> to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ?

     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy .
     The level of interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">RTC</ENAMEX> 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> than initially anticipated , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Ross</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leventhal</ENAMEX> 's co-managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> .
     And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> may have to put in a lot of money and time .
     Finding pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">funds</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sources</ENAMEX> willing to invest is a high priority .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> relations .
     `` This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Dubinin</ENAMEX> , who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">embassy</ENAMEX> here .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX> , who attended the ceremony , called the undertaking a `` historic step '' in the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> ties .
     He added that it likely will have a `` mulitiplier effect '' in stimulating further trade between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     The project will be the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-backed joint venture to be undertaken in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> , to be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton Moscow</ENAMEX> , will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> and will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 75 million</NUMEX> to build .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> will be on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Gorky Street</ENAMEX> and initially will cater mostly to business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> .
     It will have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tavern</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pub</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">discotheque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton</ENAMEX> announcement .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> is scheduled to open in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> , to be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Budapest Hotel</ENAMEX> , is to be constructed at a site even closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Red Square</ENAMEX> .
     Details about its size and cost have n't yet been determined .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX> , will have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> share in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan American </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX> , will have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> share .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">owners</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Mossoviet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's city governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">body</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">airline</ENAMEX> .
     Although a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> has a minority interest in an already operating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> venture will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> joint-venture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50 %</NUMEX> foreign ownership .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 8 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> joint ventures that have been announced since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> began encouraging such undertakings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> are among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> known to be considering such ventures .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> said they are assured under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton Moscow</ENAMEX> will charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 140 to $ 150</NUMEX> a day for each of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> , and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Sheraton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Plaskett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> to jointly operate nonstop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> flights .
     He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> .

     But no matter how much <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> gets under our skin , we 'll still have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and apple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pie</ENAMEX> .
     On <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thought , make that just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apple</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> is cropping up in orchards the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Hondas</ENAMEX> did on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> it will be planted more often than any other apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> , according to a recent survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> apple-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sages</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Washington State University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">horticulturist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Norton</ENAMEX> .
     Some fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visionaries</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> could someday tumble the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> from the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's apple heap .
     It certainly wo n't get there on looks .
     Compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less-perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinges of red .
     To hear most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> tell it , we 'd still be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Paradise</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> had proffered one to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> .
     But how sweet it is .
     It has more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> `` than any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apple</ENAMEX> we 've ever tested , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duane Greene</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pomologist</ENAMEX> , or apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> .
     It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grady Auvil</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Orondo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grower</ENAMEX> who is planting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fujis</ENAMEX> and spreading the good word about them .
     `` It does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> , razor sharp at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">83</TIMEX> , has picked and packed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">a zillion pecks</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 65 years</TIMEX> .
     He is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Granny Smith</ENAMEX> , a radically different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apple</ENAMEX> that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on .
     It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots .
     Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maverick</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> plays the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiroshi Appleseed</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> is going to be No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Delicious</ENAMEX> hegemony wo n't end anytime soon .
     New apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> grow slowly , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> is almost as entrenched as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> .
     Its roots are patriotic -- with the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> appearing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1872</TIMEX> in an orchard near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Peru</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , to be exact .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than 50 years</TIMEX> , it has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apple</ENAMEX> of our eye .
     A good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Delicious</ENAMEX> can indeed be delicious .
     More than twice as many Red Delicious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> are grown as the Golden variety , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apple</ENAMEX> .
     But the apple industry is ripe for change .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington State</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton </ENAMEX>.
     The scare over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Alar</ENAMEX> , a growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">regulator</ENAMEX> that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> shy away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Delicious</ENAMEX> , though they were less affected than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">McIntosh</ENAMEX> .
     The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> fears , was a very serious blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> wo n't be around in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years</TIMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton </ENAMEX>, although they have stopped using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Alar</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Broderick </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sterling</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grower</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is beautiful stuff , '' he says , looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> next to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">barn</ENAMEX> .
     `` But I 'm going to lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000 to $ 60,000</NUMEX> on it .
     I 'm going to have to get another job <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> just to eat . ''
     Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horde</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> , fungi and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> diseases wiggle , chew and romp through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> ' nightmares , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">maggots</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mites</ENAMEX> , mildew , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thrips</ENAMEX> , black rot and the flat-headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">borer</ENAMEX> .

     `` Rather than sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39-cents</NUMEX>-a-pound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Delicious</ENAMEX> , maybe we can sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79-cents</NUMEX>-a-pound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fujis</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Tryon</ENAMEX> , perishables <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Super Valu Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> supermarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> and food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> is a product of meticulous <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> pomological engineering , which fostered it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">50 years ago</TIMEX> at a government research orchard .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have bred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fujis</ENAMEX> to hone its color , taste and shelf life .
     Now the best of them age as gracefully as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Grannies</ENAMEX> , the industry 's gold standard for storability .
     In the cornucopia of go-go <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> 's track record stands out : During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 15 years</TIMEX> , it has gone from almost zilch to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some 50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's market .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> apple market is very keyed to high quality , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lane</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> horticulture research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Summerland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> , and so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity .

     `` I expect to see the demand exceed supply for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fujis</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next 10 to 15 years</TIMEX> , '' he adds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> , by the way , are wholesaling for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 10</NUMEX> a box <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> sees Fujis , in part , as striking a blow against the perversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supermarkets</ENAMEX> .

     After all , until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> even the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> was a firm , delectable morsel .
     Then , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> bred them more for looks , and to satisfy supermarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> ' demands of long-term storage , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red</ENAMEX> went into decline .
     Now , those red applelike things <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> sell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> are fruitbowl lovely , but usually not good eating .
     They do deserve respect , however -- they are almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">a year old</TIMEX> , probably equal to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">about 106 in human years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> , to be sure , has blemishes too .
     It ripens later than most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> , and growing it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> areas with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">chilly autumns</TIMEX> may be tricky .
     Moreover , the frumpy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fuji</ENAMEX> must compete with an increasingly dolledup <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Delicious</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grower</ENAMEX> , says the `` big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> '' at a supermarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> even rejected his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Red Delicious</ENAMEX> recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine .
     And he had n't used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">hormones</ENAMEX> , which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> employ to elongate their Delicious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> for greater eye appeal .
     Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auvil</ENAMEX> points out , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Grannies</ENAMEX> became popular without big , red looks , so why not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Fujis</ENAMEX> ?
     He sees a shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> values -- at least regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz .

     Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are aware that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> lends almost as much money as it borrows .
     From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1980 to 1988</TIMEX> , while federal budget deficits totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.41 trillion</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> issued <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 394 billion</NUMEX> of new direct loans and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 756 billion</NUMEX> of new primary loan guarantees .
     These figures omit secondary guarantees , deposit insurance , and the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government-Sponsored Enterprises</ENAMEX> -LRB- a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">concern</ENAMEX> in its own right , as detailed on this page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 3</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and policy applications , spurred on by the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular .
     As we will see , many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit .
     But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control .
     Student loan defaults remain high at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</NUMEX> , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Farmers Home Administration</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FmHA</ENAMEX> -RRB- loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs ; losses over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three years</TIMEX> are expected to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion</NUMEX> .
     Defaults on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX> loan guarantees have quadrupled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past eight years</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> reported that defaults in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> guarantees were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times as high as previously estimated , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> 's equity fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">minus $ 2.9 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">GAO</ENAMEX> 's findings are particularly troubling because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 billion</NUMEX> in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs .
     Scores of other credit programs , subsidizing agriculture , small business , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exporters</ENAMEX> , defense , energy , transportation and others , are less visible but in no better shape .
     If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering : The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 222 billion</NUMEX> in direct loans outstanding and backs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 550 billion</NUMEX> in primary guarantees . -LRB- Secondary guarantees of pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> - and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA</ENAMEX>-backed loans by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> currently exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 330 billion</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs .
     To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide , credit policy must : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets , not to provide subsidies .
     There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program .
     If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal .
     Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time .
     To avoid this problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect .
     In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets .
     For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector .
     Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds .
     However , this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans .
     Credit policy should separate these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy .
     For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral .
     The program provides highly subsidized loans to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> earns less than a particular amount .
     High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> make program costs extremely high .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and paying it back when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> graduates .
     In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , interest costs would either be paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> or added to the loan balance .
     This program , combined with cash grants to needy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Provide better incentives .
     Given the structure of most credit programs , it is surprising that default rates are not even higher .
     Guarantee rates are typically <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> , giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> little reason to screen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> carefully .
     Reducing those rates moderately -LRB- say , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> -RRB- would still provide substantial assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> .
     But it would also encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> to choose more creditworthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , and go a long way toward reducing defaults .
     For example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders ' Program .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Borrowers</ENAMEX> ' incentives are equally skewed .
     Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has a dismal record of collecting bad debts , the costs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrower</ENAMEX> of defaulting are usually low .
     In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off .
     Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection -LRB- taking the gloves off contracted collection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> -RRB- and to deny new credit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defaulters</ENAMEX> .
     These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget .
     Since the budget measures cash flow , a new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> direct loan is treated as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be paid back .
     Loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the borrower defaults , so new guarantees do not raise the deficit , even though they create future liabilities for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit .
     Predictably , guarantees outstanding have risen by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 billion</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , while direct loans outstanding have fallen by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</NUMEX> .
     The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> to forecast losses , or determined by selling loans to private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> -LRB- without federal guarantees -RRB- .
     Neither technique is perfect , but both are better than the current system , which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> .
     A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> know what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is committing them to .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . Impose standard accounting and administrative practices .
     Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> roll over their debt , paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans .
     In any case , they avoid having to write off the loans .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> simply keep bad loans on the books ; as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late as 1987</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Export-Import Bank</ENAMEX> held in its portfolio at face value loans made to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> .
     More seriously , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FmHA</ENAMEX> has carried <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several billion dollars</NUMEX> of defaulted loans at face value .
     Until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">GAO</ENAMEX> 's recent audit , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> books had not been subject to a complete external audit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> .
     The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices , including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits .
     Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises , provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions , and reduce fraud .
     Government lending was not intended to be a way to obfuscate spending figures , hide fraudulent activity , or provide large subsidies .
     The reforms described above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">lender</ENAMEX> .
     Without such reforms , credit programs will continue to be a large-scale , high-risk proposition for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> will rule that he has such authority .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto , which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill .
     He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , particularly conservative legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> , have urged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto .
     Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> that would clarify whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> already has such power .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> , confirming comments made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test case .
     But he also said that exercising a test line-item veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's agenda because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations .
     The proposal reiterates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products .
     But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> , who along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Yeutter</ENAMEX> unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">partners</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeutter</ENAMEX> , seeking to allay <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> objections to an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> , said the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal would n't `` put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> wants . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is submitting the proposal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> , hoping that the initiative will spur <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX> to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1990</TIMEX> .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> urges more `` fair play '' in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Unlike the earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> farm-trade proposal which struck <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> as too extreme , the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver .
     For instance , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> package makes clear there would be a transition period during which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">GATT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">members</ENAMEX> could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> from foreign competition .
     It also says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
     Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies , as the earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> proposal did , the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones .
     Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would be allowed to continue under certain conditions .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan also would establish procedures to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .
     The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> 's current attempt to bar imports of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> from hormone-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> contends that the rules are n't justified on health grounds .
     To encourage more competition among exporting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is proposing that export subsidies , including tax incentives for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exporters</ENAMEX> , be phased out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .

     Earnings at the consumer-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> were boosted by a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 25 cents</NUMEX> a share , stemming from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's settlement of litigation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> over patents on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Duncan Hines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cookies</ENAMEX> .
     Excluding the gain , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's earnings were close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' predictions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.40</NUMEX> a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     Wall Street had expected a modest rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's domestic sales and earnings , and more substantial increases in overseas results .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> factor helping sales and earnings was a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> price rise for most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> products , except <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     Unit volume , or amount of products shipped , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 11 %</NUMEX> in the international segment , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> continuing to win market share in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's diaper and detergent markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Freedman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Always</ENAMEX> sanitary napkin , sold under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Whisper</ENAMEX> name in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , has firmly established itself as a leading brand .
     He figures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> will expand its personal-care product line in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to `` continue that momentum . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> shipments were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1 %</NUMEX> , partly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal second quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Zurkuhlen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX> , predicts the shift will mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's sales growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> will be `` in the double digits .

     Also slowing growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> were lackluster results for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">P&amp;G</ENAMEX> 's cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oils</ENAMEX> , which had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a strong year-earlier first quarter</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">Last year</TIMEX> 's drought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> to stock up on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oils</ENAMEX> ahead of anticipated price increases , boosting sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Crisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Puritan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oils</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1965</TIMEX> was enacted to keep the promise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> and enable <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> to go to the polls , unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Twenty-five years later</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> has been transformed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">native Americans</ENAMEX> -- holding elective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and lower federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> that enforce the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> have required state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislatures</ENAMEX> and municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> to create the maximum number of `` safe '' minority election <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> form <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 65 % and 80 %</NUMEX> of the voting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> .
     The program has even been called upon to create `` safe '' white electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">municipalities</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> are the minority .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 2</ENAMEX> of the act expressly disclaims requiring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> win a proportional share of elective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> unless they carve out as many solidly minority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> as possible .
     The new goal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> -- more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> in political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> -- is laudable .
     For the political process to work , all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> , regardless of race , must feel represented .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> essential indicator that they are is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> get elected to public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> with reasonable frequency .
     As is , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> , but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 2 %</NUMEX> of elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .
     But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal .
     It is a quick fix for a complex problem .
     Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> and other minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> 's and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> 's most important trait .
     Such a policy implies that only a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> can speak for a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> , and that only a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> can govern on behalf of a white one .
     Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Birmingham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ala</ENAMEX> .
     When they reapportion their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> census , every other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">municipality</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> will face this issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> :
     Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> first amended the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> to expand its reach beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> required that the electoral map in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">borough</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> be redrawn to concentrate black and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Hasidic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> to revise <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> completed a new charter , expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Council</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     Sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , as soon as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> census becomes available , a redistricting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> will redraw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Council</ENAMEX> district lines .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Charter Revision Commission</ENAMEX> has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> 's own commitment to enhancing minority political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> currently make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and hold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25 %</NUMEX> of the seats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> .
     Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> mayoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> , have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> `` the fullest opportunity for representation . ''
     In this connection , it is important to note that several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's sitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Council</ENAMEX> represent heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> that bring together sizable black , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> , and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Maloney</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">8th district</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> and the south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Bronx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Alter</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">25th district</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , for example .
     To win their seats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> , these political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all .
     Often they have found that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Birmingham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ala.</ENAMEX> :
     The unusual situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Birmingham</ENAMEX> vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> for racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> .
     In Birmingham , which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 %</NUMEX> black , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> are the minority .
     Insisting that they are protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> brought a federal suit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> to demand that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> abandon at-large voting for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Council</ENAMEX> and create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> safe white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> .
     The white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> were not fully and fairly represented , because in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX>-wide elections only black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> or white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> who catered to `` black interests '' could win .
     No federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> has ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Rights Act</ENAMEX> protects a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> , but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> approved a districting plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Birmingham</ENAMEX> that carves out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> white-majority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> black-majority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Arrington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Birmingham</ENAMEX> 's black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , lamented the consequences .
     `` In the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had to run for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     `` Now you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> , you 're likely to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two hundred years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United States Constitution</ENAMEX> warned that the electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
     A small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> and a seaport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> could not be represented by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , they said .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Madison</ENAMEX> refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">No. 10</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Federalist Papers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX> explained that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> but instead for the common good .
     Large , heterogeneous election <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> would encourage good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX> , because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> would be compelled to serve the interests of all his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> and be servile to none .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX> 's noble and unifying vision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> still can guide us .
     As long as we believe that all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> , of every race and ethnic background , have common interests and can live together cooperatively , our political map should reflect our belief .
     Racial gerrymandering -- creating separate black and white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> -- says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has distributed these new guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorneys</ENAMEX> prosecuting <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> cases .
     A related editorial appears <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Under -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> -RCB- , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> may seek a temporary restraining order -LRB- TRO -RRB- upon the filing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> indictment , in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered .
     Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> who do business with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">vendors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX> , and others .
     Some highly publicized cases involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process .
     In order to ensure that the rights of all interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are protected , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Criminal Division</ENAMEX> has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> prosecutions . -LRB- It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements , such as review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Asset Forfeiture Office</ENAMEX> . -RRB- :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . As part of the approval process for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> prosecutions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Organized Crime and Racketeering Section</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> must show that less-intrusive remedies -LRB- such as bonds -RRB- are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . In seeking approval of a TRO , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> , balanced against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's need to preserve the assets .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . In deciding whether forfeiture -LRB- and , hence , a TRO -RRB- is appropriate , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Section</ENAMEX> will consider the nature and severity of the offense ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's crime .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . When a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> TRO is being sought , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> is required , at the earliest appropriate time , to state publicly that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's request for a TRO , and eventual forfeiture , is made in full recognition of the rights of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> -- that is , in requesting the TRO , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> ; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> assets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legitimately</ENAMEX> transferred to them ; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> ; and will , in all other respects , assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in ensuring that the rights of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are protected , through proceeding under -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> -RCB- and otherwise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Division</ENAMEX> expects that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or , at the latest , at the first proceeding before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> concerning the TRO .

     Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>-built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , as domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> paid the price for heavy incentives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are waiting for -LCB- new -RCB- factory giveaways , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Kaye</ENAMEX> , sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bob Brest Auto World</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lynn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , whose sales are slow .
     This trend appears to be especially true at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> , which used both dealer and consumer incentives to ignite sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Since then , deliveries have slumped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> sales dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69,980</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> sales fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,860</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> also had dismal results in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first 10 days of the month</TIMEX> , while other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> reported mixed results .
     All of the Big <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> suffered in the just-ended period , however , with sales of all domestically made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , including those built at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>-managed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158,863</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonal</TIMEX> adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> selling rate was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> , a small improvement from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8 million</NUMEX> rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> , but a big drop from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1 million</NUMEX> rate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Sales of domestically made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> also continued to be sluggish in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> , dropping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94,543</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     The Big <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> already have slashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> production plans <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</NUMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> levels , but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Qualls</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hill &amp; Knowlton</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> , forecasts that domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> will have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">93-day</TIMEX> supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the end of the year</TIMEX> , even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> sales improve to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5 million</NUMEX> vehicle rate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.2 %</NUMEX> drop in sales of domestic-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,995</NUMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.2 %</NUMEX> drop in domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,143</NUMEX> .
     The sales are being dragged down by a glut of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Pitcoff</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of `` scavengers '' for bargain-basement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Town &amp; Country Ford</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , still needs to move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 850</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> .
     Business had been fairly strong until <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> hit the area , but has been down since .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> also hit the rocks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> .
     The No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.7 %</NUMEX> plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> sales to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,336</NUMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.5 %</NUMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> sales to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,925</NUMEX> , which include its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minivans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Jeeps</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> , which continues to have short supplies of domestically made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Accords</ENAMEX> , saw its sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>-built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,355</NUMEX> .
     But sales of domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,651</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> attributed the increase to the use of incentives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> and to higher fleet sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> , which opened a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Georgetown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , saw sales triple to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,256</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .

     Short interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter stocks rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> , its biggest jump since <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.3 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> .
     The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite index slid <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> .
     The coincidence might lead to the conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short-sellers</ENAMEX> bet heavily on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> that OTC stocks would decline further .
     As it happens , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite did continue to fall for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> after the initial plunge .
     However , the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX> include only those trades completed , or settled , by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , rather than trades that occurred on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Finn </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NASD</ENAMEX> .
     Generally , it takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five business days</TIMEX> to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade .
     The total short interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> stocks as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237.1 million</NUMEX> shares , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223.7 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> but well below the record level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">279 million</NUMEX> shares established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1987</TIMEX> .
     The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2 %</NUMEX> decline in short interest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> rise on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> period .
     Generally , a short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later ; the short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold .
     Short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks .
     Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,412</NUMEX> of the largest OTC issues , short interest rose to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">196.8 million</NUMEX> shares , from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">185.7 million</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,379</NUMEX> stocks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Big stocks with large short interest gains as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> .
     Short interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> , an insurance issue , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's short interest jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 %</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> 's increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> makes semiconductors and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> operates department-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> and is strained for cash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meritor Savings</ENAMEX> again had the dubious honor of being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Meritor</ENAMEX> has headed the list since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> and troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> were next in line .
     Short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market .
     Shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying .
     In addition , changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage .
     For example , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> involved and shorting the stock of the other .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge .

     From the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30-Oct . 4</TIMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Economist </ENAMEX>:
     What defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aoun</ENAMEX> was not only the weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> .
     The weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lebanon</ENAMEX> 's history was also against him ; and it is a history <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> is in danger of repeating .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , and however unfairly , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> is regarded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> world as a colonial aberration .
     Its best hope of acceptance by its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">neighbours</ENAMEX> lies in reaching a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> is being remade by demography .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greater Israel</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under six</TIMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Muslims</ENAMEX> .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">25 years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> will probably be the minority .
     Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> will neither share power with all these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arabs</ENAMEX> nor , says its present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> , redraw its borders closer to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre-1967</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">heartland</ENAMEX> .
     By not choosing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these options , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> will condemn themselves , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Maronites</ENAMEX> did , to perpetual war with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Muslims</ENAMEX> in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> .
     Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Maronites</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> will become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Belfast</ENAMEX> before it becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beirut</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> .
     The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally .
     After plummeting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.52</NUMEX> , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">461.70</NUMEX> .
     In contrast , the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> .
     The New York Stock Exchange Composite was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> lower for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     As usual , the over-the-counter market 's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> , battered by profit taking in recent sessions , sank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 4</NUMEX> ; but it finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 7\/8</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/4</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX> , the most active issue , finished down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 1\/8</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> traded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 41 3\/8</NUMEX> during the session .
     Other active stocks included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> depositary receipts added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 1\/4</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> improved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 5\/8</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> slipped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 1\/4</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National Corp.</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 1\/8</NUMEX> .
     `` The market started with several strikes against it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of retail equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating .
     But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> said .
     Even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> down more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> does execute orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> acknowledged .
     The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , too .
     They do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur .
     That means that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">days</TIMEX> when prices are tumbling and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> abound they must be willing to buy shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> when no one else will .
     In such an environment , a market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> can absorb huge losses .
     But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale .
     The market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly .
     The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groused Robert Antolini</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of over-the-counter trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</ENAMEX> : `` It 's making it tough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to make money . ''
     He said that when sell programs kick in , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> believe that `` there 's no sense in sticking your nose out because you 're an instant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loser</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Kinder-Care Learning Centers</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7\/8</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">461,200</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lodestar Group</ENAMEX> said it will make a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6</NUMEX>-a-share offer for the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Kinder-Care Learning Center</ENAMEX> common stock if it acquires a majority of the company 's shares in a pending rights offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Kinder-Care Learning Center</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Kinder-Care Inc</ENAMEX> .

     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 23 , 1989</TIMEX> .
     We 're happy , we guess , to receive confirmation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> violation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> after we started writing about it .
     Perhaps even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apologists</ENAMEX> will now accede .
     Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chambers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Politburo</ENAMEX> .
     As it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has recognized it has a credibility problem .
     So after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">70 years</TIMEX> , it is confessing the obvious , hoping to be believed about other things .
     It 's not enough .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious .
     Our own test of `` glasnost 's '' authenticity would be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> decision to open itself to a complete international examination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most troubling mysteries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> relations -- the reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> anthrax outbreak at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> there , and hence a violation of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Biological Weapons Convention</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's recently issued `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Soviet Military Power</ENAMEX> , '' though in general adopting a softer line , repeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> assessment .
     It also was detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional</ENAMEX> testimony <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past February</TIMEX> : An explosion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Microbiology and Virology Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths .
     Since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> did not address this topic before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Supreme Soviet </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> .
     We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze </ENAMEX>'s assurance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> did n't violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty .
     And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressmen</ENAMEX> and arms-control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> who visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> , we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> who met with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' explanation is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX> came from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lot of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">feed</ENAMEX> made from the bones of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Meselson</ENAMEX> -- who we read has sold something called the `` scientific community '' on the notion that `` yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">rain</ENAMEX> '' attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Laotian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Hmong</ENAMEX> were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> -- found the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> anthrax scenario `` completely plausible . ''

     And we certainly do not believe that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> or any of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emissaries</ENAMEX> yet deserve to have the West take their word for it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> complaint , as with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> , is no mere political posturing .
     Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     But the stated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> position is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> violated the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> agreement or , alternatively , that would give <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident .
     Until that happens , glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> was bidding for with his confessions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manville Corp.</ENAMEX> said it offered to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> of its convertible preferred stock from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ENAMEX> in a move that would improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> shares outstanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> said it made the offer within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past several weeks</TIMEX> as part of an effort to improve shareholder value .
     It said it would purchase the stock at market price .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> said that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made .
     `` We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , '' the trust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> , created as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asbestos-related diseases</ENAMEX> , owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2 million</NUMEX> of the Series A convertible preferred shares , which are each convertible into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> common shares .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> also owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 million</NUMEX> common shares outstanding .
     Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> 's closing price <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.25</NUMEX> a share , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> 's offer would purchase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5.4 million</NUMEX> of its preferred shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> 's preferred stock holding .
     In addition to the stock and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> 's profits beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , the trust is supposed to receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> over its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">27-year</TIMEX> life .
     But it initially was funded with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 765 million</NUMEX> and may soon face a cash crunch .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> , it had settled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15,000</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81,000</NUMEX> claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 136 million</NUMEX> , a large portion of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 268 million</NUMEX> in cash and marketable securities .
     Since most of its assets are tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> , a forest and building products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> might also want to diversify its holdings .
     As part of its offer , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> would n't elaborate on the proposed changes .
     But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> said the shares issued to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">trust</ENAMEX> were intended to be sold , as needed , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Manville</ENAMEX> has the right of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> refusal to buy those shares .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> 's raised bid , which was supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> 's official shareholder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> trying to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> .

     Some of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other bidding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are expected to increase their offers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> .
     A hearing is set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> do n't expect a resolution until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1990</TIMEX> .
     Under the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX> plan , it would pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.65 billion</NUMEX> in cash to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">creditors</ENAMEX> and assume <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> in pollution control bonds .
     Secured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">creditors</ENAMEX> would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">creditors</ENAMEX> would receive only principal and interest accrued before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> protection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX>
     The biggest change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> 's offer was in improvements made for equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> who had been given short shrift previously .
     Assuming full operation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Seabrook</ENAMEX> nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> would receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 500 million</NUMEX> in cash , preferred stock and new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Seabrook</ENAMEX> bonds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> 's previous offer had proposed that equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 165 million</NUMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> promised the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">State of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> that rate increases would be limited to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> annually for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> .

     That plan would leave existing preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> with at least a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</NUMEX> stake and give common shareholders <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 13 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New England Electric System</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Westborough</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , has proposed buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> as part of a plan that would require rate increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4.8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> .

     Once again , the indomitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> holds <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's future in his hands .

     Factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> on strike knocked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> off balance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> who brought them down .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> held onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> , waiting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> 's usual state-directed price rises .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> froze prices instead .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> ran a boycott , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> disappeared from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 1</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> tore up its controls , and food prices leaped .
     Without buffer stocks , inflation exploded .
     That was when the tame old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Peasants ' Party</ENAMEX> , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> and joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Solidarity</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> 's first liberated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     But by the time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Solidarity</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , the damage was done .
     `` Shortageflation , '' as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have come to call it , had gone hyper .
     The cost of raising a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> stayed angry .
     They still are .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">a cool day</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> travel to the private market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Radzymin</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw</ENAMEX> , hauling <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> and sacks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">feed</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> 's official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers</ENAMEX> ca n't induce them to sell .
     Here , they are searching for a higher price .
     In a crush of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> and horse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carts</ENAMEX> on the trodden field , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrzej Latowski</ENAMEX> wrestles a screeching , overweight <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hog</ENAMEX> into the trunk of a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> .

     A heavy , kerchiefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> runs a handful through her fingers , and counts him out a pile of zlotys .
     `` Country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> breed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chojnowski</ENAMEX> , leaning against the back of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> .
     `` They ca n't buy feed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .

     At closing time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> cart out most of what they carted in .
     A private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business .
     The hulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Stalinism</ENAMEX> , it seems , will not quickly crumble away .
     State <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">monopolies</ENAMEX> will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tractors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fertilizers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">feed</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">40 years</TIMEX> working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here .
     Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Solidarity</ENAMEX> has barely started .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> agriculture does possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> great asset already : the private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> .
     `` We are dealing with real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni Leopold</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> who advises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Rural Solidarity</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">union</ENAMEX> 's countryside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">offshoot</ENAMEX> .
     `` There are a lot of them , and they have property . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> , spurning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectivizers</ENAMEX> , were once a source of shame to orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> .
     Now , among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> , they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> of envy .
     Food is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX> 's top priority , the key to popular support .
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> have shown and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> are learning , family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> thrive where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectives</ENAMEX> fail .
     Ownership , it seems , is the best fertilizer .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> have had it all along .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7 million</NUMEX> small private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> cover <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 %</NUMEX> of its arable land .

     Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> is a pillar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .

     `` It 's bad soil , '' he says .
     Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963</TIMEX> , it was good soil .
     Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmers</ENAMEX> lay down before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bulldozers</ENAMEX> .
     Their protest was ignored .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dam</ENAMEX> caused the water level to drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zalubice</ENAMEX> .
     Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> smiles and his brow furrows .
     He expected as much .
     In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">lifetime</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">47 years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> brought electricity to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">village</ENAMEX> and piped in drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> from the reservoir .
     No phones .
     No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> .
     `` We wanted them to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> here , '' he says .
     `` They started , and then abandoned it . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tractor</ENAMEX> , his only mechanized equipment , stands in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pigsty</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> .
     Good for nothing .
     Parts are a tragedy .
     Even if I had a lot of money , I could n't buy what I need . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> can say the same for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cement</ENAMEX> , saw blades .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> of all investment goes toward making things <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> want ; in the West , it is closer to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> .
     The few big state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> take first crack at what does get made .
     They use <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fertilizer</ENAMEX> per acre , twice the high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">feed</ENAMEX> .
     Yet their best boast is that they produce <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 've heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> are subsidized , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> says as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wieslawa </ENAMEX>, sets some chairs out in the sun .
     `` We have one near here .
     There is a lot of waste .
     A private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> never wastes anything . ''
     The state quit shoving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> onto its subsidized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">over 30 years ago</TIMEX> .
     But it never did let up on the pressure .
     Until recently , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> with no heir had to will the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> his land to collect his pension .
     The pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     His allotment of materials also did , until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> could n't hold up its end of that bargain .
     Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> alone sells <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">seeds</ENAMEX> and machines .
     When supplies are short , it often hands them over only in exchange for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> .
     A private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> is free to buy and sell land , hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">help</ENAMEX> , decide what to grow and how to grow it .
     He is free to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> , and to fail for lack of chicken wire .
     He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices .
     `` I 'm on my own land , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> says .
     `` I do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do . ''
     `` Sometimes , '' says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , `` we 're happy about that . ''
     By starving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> have starved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">Villages</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zalubice</ENAMEX> exist in a desert of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> and few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> .
     Farm income is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> below the average .
     The young leave , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who wo n't milk <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> by hand .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> stay , their best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">vodka</ENAMEX> , but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">two million acres</NUMEX> have gone fallow .
     Without machines , good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> ca n't get bigger .
     So the potato <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> , once <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">47 million tons</NUMEX> , is down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Meat</ENAMEX> consumption is at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> 's level , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> production at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> 's , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> output at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> 's .
     If a food crisis undid the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communists</ENAMEX> , a food revolution will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Solidarity</ENAMEX> .
     The potential is displayed along every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw</ENAMEX> : row upon row of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">greenhouses</ENAMEX> , stretching out behind modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mansions</ENAMEX> that trumpet their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> ' wealth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Vegetables</ENAMEX> are abundant and full of flavor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pickles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sauerkraut</ENAMEX> sublime , the state monopolies long broken .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Grain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">milk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> come next .
     A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> can spare , although a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">smokehouse</ENAMEX> or a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dairy</ENAMEX> can spring up fast .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> makes no machinery for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> on that scale .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Solidarity</ENAMEX> wants it from the West .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Stolzman</ENAMEX> , one of its farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> , lays it on the line : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Bank</ENAMEX> will be brought in to help us destroy the old system . ''

     `` I do n't want expensive machines .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> approved a short-term spending bill to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> operating through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> and provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">321</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> is sure to aggravate budget pressures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and next under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit reduction law .
     By a lopsided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> margin , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber</ENAMEX> rejected an effort to waive <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> for purposes of addressing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disasters , and budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> estimate the increased appropriations will widen the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> deficit by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 1.44 billion</NUMEX> unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     The budget impact will be greater still in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> , and the issue forced a confrontation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Budget Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> district was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> of the earthquake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     Going to the well of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> demanded the costs be fully counted .
     His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on whom his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> will be most dependent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead</TIMEX> .
     `` We do not come to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> asking for any handout , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> .
     `` We do not intend to hide these costs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> package incorporates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> for low-interest disaster loans , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in highway construction funds , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.35 billion</NUMEX> divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
     The funds are in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> appropriated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> , bringing the total for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disasters to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 4 billion</NUMEX> in unanticipated spending .
     Because of the vagaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> , the immediate impact is relatively small .
     But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> .
     Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittees</ENAMEX> that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget .
     The underlying bill approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> is required to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> operating past <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight</TIMEX> , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance .
     The hastily drafted measure could hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185 million</NUMEX> in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Also , the high price of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average .
     For example , disaster loans , which will go to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> , offer credit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as low as 4 %</NUMEX> in some cases .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> to assist the hard hit but often wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina district</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to make some modifications <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , but both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> appear most anxious to speed final approval before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> 's deadline .
     Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> changes are expected to be largely technical -- dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> loans to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> to accommodate the increased activity expected .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's floor action came as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 8.5 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> military construction bill , representing a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> reduction from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and making severe cuts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests for installations abroad .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $ 25.8 million</NUMEX> is allocated to continue work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Oman</ENAMEX> .
     But all funding is cut for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> , and projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> are cut to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a sixth</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's request .
     Closer to home , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> were more generous .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $ 38.9 million</NUMEX> was set aside for military installations in the home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.G.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> are traditionally powerful within the conference , but equally striking is the dominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process .

     No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> illustrated this mix of power more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> .
     In the final trading , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> was insistent on setting aside <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> to carry out base closings ordered to begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     But it gave ground to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> on a number of projects , ranging from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 million</NUMEX> parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garage</ENAMEX> here , to a land transfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> , to a provision to assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Makwah Indian Tribe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> , who chairs the select <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> , used his power to move <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400,000</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bureau of Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> have tentatively agreed on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.18 billion</NUMEX> anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative , cutting other federal spending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.43 %</NUMEX> to pay for it .
     A formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference is expected to ratify the accord <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> is preparing to slash the size of its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , possibly as soon as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's strategy .
     The size of the cuts is n't known , but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , which is responsible for locating oil reserves , drilling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> and pumping crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> and natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> have n't yet been notified .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> said that meetings to discuss the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> reductions have been scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Orleans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> .
     This would be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of cuts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> , which along with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">refiners</ENAMEX> reduced its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> as part of an industrywide shakeout .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in their domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX>-producing operations .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings report , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> alluded to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> provision for restructuring costs involving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> exploration and production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     The report says that `` the restructuring will take place over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> . ''
     A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , reached at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> , would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the week</TIMEX> .
     Most oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> , have been reporting lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> 's strategy say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> is reducing its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> because of declining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> output .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> said domestic exploration and production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 million</NUMEX> loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , while comparable foreign operations earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 234 million</NUMEX> .
     Industrywide , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> production in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> fell by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">500,000 barrels</NUMEX> a day to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">7.7 million barrels</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first eight months of this year</TIMEX> .
     Daily output is expected to decline by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">at least another 500,000 barrels</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were notified .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> said that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> charge related to the action indicates `` a substantial '' number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will be involved .
     Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sentelle</ENAMEX> recently called a `` monster . ''
     Needless to say , he was talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> .
     With its recently revised guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> .
     The text of the `` new policy '' guidelines from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Criminal Division</ENAMEX> are reprinted nearby .
     They strongly suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> 's prosecutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Princeton\/Newport</ENAMEX> violated notions of fundamental fairness .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics .
     This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> mayoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> , who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets .
     The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and others .
     This follows earlier new guidelines from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tax Division</ENAMEX> prohibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Princeton\/Newport</ENAMEX>-like tax cases from masquerading as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> cases .
     The forfeiture memo cited `` considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process . ''
     It told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> not to seek forfeitures if there are `` less intrusive '' alternatives , such as bonds , and in any case not to seek forfeitures `` disproportionate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's crime . ''
     These changes come a tad late for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Princeton\/Newport</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> RICOed securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     It was forced into liquidation before trial when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> yanked their funds after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Princeton\/Newport</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McKinsey &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> endowment , made the rational decision to withdraw their money ; for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , the liquidation was sentence <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , verdict later .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> wanted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.8 million</NUMEX> in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 400,000</NUMEX> .
     The experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Princeton\/Newport</ENAMEX> and initiation of other <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX>-forfeiture cases against legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> taught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> that a RICOed investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> would be an ex-investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges `` which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is not in a position to dispute '' because of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> .
     Part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's plea was to cut Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> loose .
     So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what , if anything , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> did wrong .
     So <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cheers for the new rules .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> has finally recognized its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ' abuses , thanks largely to the demands for reform by former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph diGenova</ENAMEX> , who wants to salvage <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> for real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> .
     But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> is willing and able to supervise hyperactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sentelle</ENAMEX> , of the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , made this point at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cato Institute</ENAMEX> conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in a remarkable speech titled , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">RICO : The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence</ENAMEX> . ''
     He said ours is supposed to be `` a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> of laws not of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , '' and yet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> `` tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> . ''
     No prosecutorial guidelines , observed or unobserved , limit civil <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> cases by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> for damages .
     What now for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Princeton\/Newport</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred .
     We suspect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> will <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some day</TIMEX> agree that only the complete repeal of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> can guarantee an end to injustices in its name .
