     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.8 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a record year-ago quarter</TIMEX> .
     The decline broke a streak of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 quarters</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> posted earnings increases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 589 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.29</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 632 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.36</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.15 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 94.625</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full-year</TIMEX> earnings will total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 14.60</NUMEX> a share , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's record net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.76</NUMEX> a share .
     But that signal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full-year</TIMEX> profit casts doubt on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> will improve on its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago fourth-quarter</TIMEX> net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.44</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 635 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> would earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.85</NUMEX> a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> if it equaled that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago fourth-quarter</TIMEX> performance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were signaling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would earn less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> even before they announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> a plan to acquire <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marion Laboratories Inc .</ENAMEX>
     That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> has n't said exactly what impact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marion</ENAMEX> acquisition will have on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> blamed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings drop on several factors , including softer prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> and other basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> , a slower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy and a stronger dollar , which made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> 's exports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> more expensive to overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Another problem was a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 %</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of the year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.06 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.41</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.76 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.32</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest nine months</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.34 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.38 billion</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .

     Whether or not `` great cases make bad-law '' -- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethan Bronner</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Battle for Justice : How the Bork Nomination Shook America </ENAMEX>'' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norton</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">399</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.50</NUMEX> -RRB- is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings , done with journalistic verve , but with a flawed legal philosophy .
     While the book amply justifies its subtitle , the title itself is dubious .
     What shook <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> was not a battle for justice but for naked power , in which an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">army</ENAMEX> of judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> rolled over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> they had demonized .
     In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic , with piquant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> portrayal , hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> docudrama than in a constitutional history .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronner</ENAMEX> seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way .
     I doubt that .
     Given <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> frustration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> victories and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Court</ENAMEX> appointments , the contingency plans in place , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> 's paper trail of vulnerable writings , it was pretty clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> never stood much chance of being confirmed .
     As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronner</ENAMEX> himself says , the smell of `` raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> '' was in the air .
     Perhaps because they won , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX> come through more vividly than his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Neas</ENAMEX> was the organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> , whipping a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">conglomerate</ENAMEX> of pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> into an irresistible attacking force .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Laurence Tribe</ENAMEX> was the constitutional heavy , laying out legal strategies for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> to follow .
     But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kennedy</ENAMEX> who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Robert Bork 's America</ENAMEX> '' -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically , he claimed , from the positions Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> had taken over the space of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two decades</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> , never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground , emoted brilliantly .
     I add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> engaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> was willing to stretch the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area -LRB- free speech -RRB- while remaining rigid in all the others .
     It achieved a good media play , and enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specter</ENAMEX> and others to vote against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> out of `` conscience . ''
     Further ammunition came from left legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Dworkin</ENAMEX> , who in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Review of Books</ENAMEX> painted a picture of a constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zombie</ENAMEX> willfully reading his personal prejudices into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> , particularly in the area of `` original intent . ''
     The charge of being `` outside the mainstream '' of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> 's scholarly standing , leaving him bleeding on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">platform</ENAMEX> .
     The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southwest</ENAMEX> had broken party lines .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett Johnson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> reminded the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> that anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> could furnish the margin to punish them in their next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> elections .
     Demographics converged with `` mainstream '' and demonizing to seal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bork</ENAMEX> 's fate .
     The upshot ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> chose the battlefield , held it and kept it .
     Yet with the smooth confirmation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Kennedy</ENAMEX> , an `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">percenter</ENAMEX> '' only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> may have won the battle but lost the war .
     Another upshot , however , was the chilling message the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> draws its talent .
     The word went forth to every law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey , with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen .
     Unfortunately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> simply does n't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents .
     He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture .
     Probing more deeply into the doctrine of `` judicial restraint , '' he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> .
     He would discover it also in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Bickel</ENAMEX> , a subtle constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> 's closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Yale</ENAMEX> , whose influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> goes well beyond Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronner</ENAMEX> 's reporting .
     Still , the long view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bork</ENAMEX> as constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinker</ENAMEX> must be a spotty one .
     His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine , which keeps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Court</ENAMEX> clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">democracy</ENAMEX> to elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislatures</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     Unfortunately , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere .
     The question of segregated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Education</ENAMEX> , was such an issue .
     In our time abortion has become another , best left to a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decisions rather than to the chaos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislatures</ENAMEX> .
     A reflective and growing consensus of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters -LRB- decided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griswold</ENAMEX> case -RRB- to abortion as well .
     One can understand Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> 's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched , though a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with realism , guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it .
     What is certain is that if <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> allow another happening like the degrading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> confirmation circus , it will be at their peril .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lerner</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , the world 's biggest auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> , is taking a huge Wall Street-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Dorrance Jr.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> has guaranteed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that it will receive a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> for the collection , regardless of what the bids for the art works total , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> close to the transaction say .
     The collection , which includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picassos</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX> , other paintings , furniture and porcelains , went on sale last night in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> auctions .
     What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     If the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> , it makes a profit .
     At the initial sale last night , for example -- the sale featuring the Impressionists <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> -- bids totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116 million</NUMEX> .
     That was slightly above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> presale estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 111 million</NUMEX> .
     Normally , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> would have earned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of the total in commissions .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the transaction said , the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> .
     Art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say that while auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> occasionally guarantee the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price , a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana D. Brooks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's North America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , vehemently denies it offered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> a money-back guarantee , calling such reports `` inaccurate . ''
     Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale , however , appears the statement , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has an interest in the property in this catalog . ''
     Explains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> , the statement `` means exactly what it says .
     We have some level of financial interest '' in the collection .
     `` We do n't disclose specifics . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Mirabello</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> estate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan , Lewis &amp; Bockius</ENAMEX> , declines to comment on the financial arrangements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> made the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> guarantee to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> collection away from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">archrival</ENAMEX> , auction house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's International PLC</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> has handled smaller sales for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> asked why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> was n't picked to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> collection , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> `` told us it was a question of financial considerations , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Findlay </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of impressionist and modern paintings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors</ENAMEX> who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom , but recently it appears <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has been returning the compliment .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November 1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> essentially offered a Wall Street-style `` bridge loan '' of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 27 million</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> to enable him to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Irises</ENAMEX> '' for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.9 million</NUMEX> .
     It was the highest bid in history for a work of art .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> is offering such deals because it 's an art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> ' market , at least where the best works are concerned , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lerner</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the book `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Art Law</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` There seems to be a lot of art for sale , but there 's more competition .
     The competition gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> the ability to cut a better deal , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above $ 100 million</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the transaction said .
     But it 's likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> will take a higher than usual commission , called an override , on the amount exceeding the guarantee .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has been aggressively promoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> sale .
     At a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May</TIMEX> announcing plans for the auction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> estimated its value in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> .
     More recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> has predicted the collection will fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 140 million</NUMEX> .
     That 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history .
     The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many , since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> had served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Philadelphia Museum of Art </ENAMEX>, and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">institution</ENAMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> 's sale , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> works that sold were purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aska International Gallery</ENAMEX> , the art-acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aichi Financial</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> that owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> has to throw out the idea that the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> is a disinterested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">middleman</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tunick</ENAMEX> .
     While he adds that he has no problem with auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> who sell works in which they have a financial interest , `` It ought not to be hidden in some small print . ''
     In such situations , he says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> `` is going to put the best light on things . ''
     For example , an auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with `` very open eyes , '' he says .
     `` There 's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Miller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Art Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> , an art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lender</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> and auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> `` know if they do n't lay out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half a million</NUMEX> for this , another one will ; it 's that competitive . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coe Kerr Gallery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beadleston Fine Arts</ENAMEX> , snatched a major art collection owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Askin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> away from rival auction-house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> with an up-front payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said that while the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> sometimes waives its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> 's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> wo n't offer financial guarantees because `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christie 's</ENAMEX> believes its primary role is as an auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> , and therefore as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent</ENAMEX> -LCB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> -RCB- , not as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> tapped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> : reforming a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> in crisis .
     But unlike the other new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> will face an immediate threat to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's very existence : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> reunification .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 52</TIMEX> , is known as an old-guard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ironfist</ENAMEX> , one likely to continue the method of running a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> made famous .
     Even if he were to change his stripes and become another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Friedman</ENAMEX> , however , he would still stand a good chance of losing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> almost certainly will be a younger version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX> , his rigid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has followed much the same career path as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> : Both spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> overseeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Freie Deutsche Jugend</ENAMEX> , the youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that is the communist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> 's principal tool for stamping young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> into socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> .
     More recently , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has been in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> security , and is the youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> .
     Faced with another Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> , so many despairing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East Germans</ENAMEX> are likely to flee that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> will get their reunification , de facto , on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> ground .
     But if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Politburo</ENAMEX> does loosen up enough to permit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental .
     Abandoning socialism means abandoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">watchdogs</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Wall</ENAMEX> .
     In this scenario it 's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Republic</ENAMEX> could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic , federal or stronger -- with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may need a bit of time to consolidate his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">empire</ENAMEX> , which would do a lot to promote Reunification Scenario One .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cartoonists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> : `` Wanted : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">embassies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Prague</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Budapest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Warsaw</ENAMEX> are continuing to find refugees at their gates .
     Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> , true to its tradition , could tighten its borders yet further .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the last gestures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> were to close the border to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier .
     But with world-wide opinion -- even , apparently in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> -- against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> would have to turn itself into an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Albania</ENAMEX> to clamp down further on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> .
     There have been some reports that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is moving to `` soften '' his reputation , notably rumors that it was he who kept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> 's state police off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> ' backs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's dismal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40th</NUMEX> anniversary celebrations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> .
     But even if he effects a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jekyll</ENAMEX> transformation , he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two .
     The problem is one that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> shares with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">half-states</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">North Korea</ENAMEX> , but one it must shoulder alone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> moves to reform , it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Pilsudski</ENAMEX> 's interwar republic , it was a nonsocialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">democracy</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Czech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter the Great</ENAMEX> to rediscover , should it choose to .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> is merely `` the land of truly existing socialism . ''
     Beyond that , it has to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> for a claim to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> identity .
     Up to now , the main weapon of the `` worker and peasant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> '' has been the ideology of socialism .
     With talk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> economic miracle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">league</ENAMEX> .
     Without <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> 's military and party behind it , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> runs the risk of disintegrating .
     If it goes capitalist , and increases trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , it will convert itself , willy-nilly , into an economic annex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Republic</ENAMEX> .
     There 's a certain cruel logic at work here : It 's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Marx</ENAMEX> should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as controls .
     There may be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that would delay this scenario .
     Ideologues are the last to surrender , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> are an ideological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> who greeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Berlin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> were n't shouting `` Go <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.A</ENAMEX> '' -- they were chanting `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorby</ENAMEX> , Help Us . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ideologues</ENAMEX> on the other side of the border can also slow the process .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> 's governing conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">coalition</ENAMEX> is proving admirably true to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> constitution by making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> descent automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> alone .
     But within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">think tanks</ENAMEX> outside it , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West Germans</ENAMEX> maintain that they do n't want immediate reunification .
     Politically , this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     But it would be ironic if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> 's reunification , just like its division , eventually were the result of actions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">centers</ENAMEX> of power other than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berlin</ENAMEX> .
     In a statement that was as close as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> gets to practicing `` glasnost '' , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Reinhold</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> , actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma .
     `` The main problem , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinhold</ENAMEX> said in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> radio interview monitored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Munich</ENAMEX> , stems from the fact that `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">GDR</ENAMEX> is different '' from other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">East European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">states</ENAMEX> .
     `` What kind of right to exist , '' he asked , `` would a capitalist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX> have alongside a capitalist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Republic</ENAMEX> ? ''
     That 's a question <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">East Germany</ENAMEX> ca n't answer easily , no matter what its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> does .

     While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodland</ENAMEX> does n't predict a significant climb for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world , he noted that `` its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- `` impressively '' limited .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8485 marks</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8667 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.75 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     Sterling was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5920</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5753</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">140.97 yen</NUMEX> , down from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.10 yen</NUMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's dive in stock market prices , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> 's stock market debacle .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> note that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's stock market tailspin and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> wants the key federal funds rate .
     They say that the earthquake , by preventing many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> from operating at full capacity , has given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> did , in fact , execute <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> set of repurchase orders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate .
     For now , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street .
     They note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad news from the stock exchange .
     Indeed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit edged lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 13</NUMEX> points in early trading .
     A slight recovery in the stock market gave currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> confidence to push the dollar higher before the unit dropped back by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> 's end .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita</ENAMEX> that appeared to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to be very careful in investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> leveraged buy-outs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> suggest that the only positive news on the horizon that could detract attention from equities transactions is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> consumer price data .
     The figures , due for release <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , are expected to show an uptick in inflation to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     If the figures show a hefty rise in inflation , they could militate against easing by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> for current delivery rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.30</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 368.70</NUMEX> an ounce in moderate trading .
     Estimated volume was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">three million ounces</NUMEX> .

     Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area refinery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complexes</ENAMEX> , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed .
     Trading on little specific information , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> overnight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> began bidding up oil prices .
     The rally spread into <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> markets , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area 's large oil refining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> , much of the world was still unable to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> by telephone .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> was bid up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 20 cents</NUMEX> a barrel in many overseas markets .
     At the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery shot up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> a barrel , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.85</NUMEX> , still on the belief that the refineries were damaged .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">roughly 800,000 barrels</NUMEX> a day of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> of all the refining capacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , is processed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> , according to industry data .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than the past year</TIMEX> , even the rumor of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> wore on , some major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Oil Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Dutch\/Shell Group</ENAMEX> -- said their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries</ENAMEX> were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally .
     Most said they shut down their petroleum pipeline operations as a precaution but did n't see any immediate damage .
     Gasoline <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">terminals</ENAMEX> were also largely unhurt , they said .
     `` It 's hard to imagine how the markets were speculating , given that nobody could get through to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> amazed oil company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     As the news spread that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries</ENAMEX> were intact , crude prices plunged , ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.56</NUMEX> a barrel , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 cents</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Gasoline</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery was off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.26 cents</NUMEX> a gallon to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54.58 cents</NUMEX> .
     Heating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> finished at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60.6 cents</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.45 cent</NUMEX> .
     `` The market was basically acting on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contradictory forces , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nauman Barakat</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> is the panic , the earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , which is positive . ''
     But once that factor was eliminated , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> took profits and focused on crude oil inventories , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barakat</ENAMEX> said .
     After the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Petroleum Institute</ENAMEX> had reported that crude stocks increased by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">5.7 million barrels</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Friday</TIMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> viewed as bearish .
     But some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> still think earthquake speculation could have more impact on the oil markets .
     `` The problem is that while on the surface everything is all right , the question is , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barakat </ENAMEX>, `` was there any structural damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pipelines</ENAMEX> or anything else . ''
     In other commodity markets yesterday :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">COPPER</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry 's labor situation .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract declined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.85 cents</NUMEX> a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2645</NUMEX> .
     According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> copper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , which has n't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late August</TIMEX> , are set to return to work .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said it will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about two to three months</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> begins to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> in significant quantities .
     He added that , while there has n't been any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> announcement as yet , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> mine strike in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> , which has lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than three months</TIMEX> , is regarded as settled .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> return to operation may not be as near as some expect .
     `` There are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs , which has been a critical issue all along , '' he said .
     Nevertheless , the increasing likelihood that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major supply disruptions will be resolved weighed on the market , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> agreed .
     Both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> are normally major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">suppliers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , which has been buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> on the world market .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> , bought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation , at least over the long term , appears to have improved .
     `` The focus for some time has been on the copper supply , and good demand has been taken for granted , '' he said .
     `` Now that the supply situation seems to be improving , it would be best for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to switch their concentration to the demand side . ''
     He noted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that housing starts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.26 million</NUMEX> units on an annualized basis , the lowest level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> .
     `` Along with these factors , other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy , which could mean reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> usage , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SUGAR</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices extended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's gains .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> delivery ended with an advance of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16 cent</NUMEX> a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.27 cents</NUMEX> , for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-day</TIMEX> gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3 cent</NUMEX> .
     According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> said it has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only 40,000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> remaining to be shipped to it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> under current commitments .
     The announcement was made because of reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> would delay shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year</TIMEX> , into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> said the quantity mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> announcement is so small that it 's meaningless .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> harvest caused by adverse weather .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm .
     That <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> recently bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">200,000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> and had been expected to seek a like quantity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> but did n't .
     `` It 's known they need the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> , and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">LIVESTOCK</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">MEATS</ENAMEX> :
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> is expected to announce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> major ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.21 million</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> compared with the level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Morgan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sterling Research Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Arlington Heights</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill .</ENAMEX>
     Cattle prices have risen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> on speculation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> report will signal tighter supplies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> .
     Among other things , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is expected to report that the number of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> placed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">feedlots</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> .
     Feedlots fatten <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> for slaughter , so a drop indicates that the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> will dip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this winter</TIMEX> .
     Indeed , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to report that the movement of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> onto feedlots in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month of September</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> big ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> compared with the level for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> .

     A new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Admistration</ENAMEX> , and its long-term effects are unknown .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">FK-506</ENAMEX> , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates .
     Rejection has been the major obstacle in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30,000</NUMEX> organ transplants performed world-wide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> began using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> transplants have been rejected .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , is metabolized from soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fungus</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to be given the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , which is made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co .</ENAMEX>

     `` We consider it a life-saving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , like one for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fung</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunologist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> say they believe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">FK-506</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> , made by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sandoz Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">FK-506</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> , which can cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and other problems .
     `` The side effects -LCB- of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> -RCB- have made the penalty for its success rather high , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starzl</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fung</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">FK-506</ENAMEX> would not be available in the market for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least a year</TIMEX> , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> approval process usually takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years to five years</TIMEX> .
     There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> performs the most transplants in the world .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> could n't estimate the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> when it reaches the market , but they said <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">FK-506</ENAMEX> will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to cut hospital stays by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> among transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starzl</ENAMEX> said the research has been largely financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Health</ENAMEX> and by university funds , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujisawa</ENAMEX> did n't give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> any grants .
     He said that the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> had no financial stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David N. Laband</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 27</TIMEX> editorial-page article , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">In Hugo 's Path , a Man-Made Disaster</ENAMEX> , '' decries the control of price gouging , swiftly ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> , `` screaming '' for price controls occurs when income redistribution `` threatens to hit home . ''
     To be sure , the threat has hit home down here .
     Yet in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> 's rehash of free-market logic , human greed and self-interest are the only permissible psychological reactions .
     Allowing uncontrolled prices for necessities would indeed shorten the lines at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , as he contends .
     But not because resources are going to their most efficient use , leaving scarce goods `` allocated to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> who place the highest value on them . ''
     Rather , lines would diminish because at higher prices many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> could not afford necessities such as food and medical supplies .
     It is inhumane to imply that a poor , unemployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> can not receive immediate relief for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> at fair prices because she does not have as much to protect as a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , essential relief supplies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice</ENAMEX> must be distributed throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> because of potential health problems from spoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> and possible outbreak of disease .
     Such spillover effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources .
     Fortunately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> are not motivated by self-interest , but by altruism .
     Why should they have to co-exist with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opportunists</ENAMEX> rushing in to turn a quick profit ?
     These latter-day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scalawags</ENAMEX> would be ill-advised to take advantage of the situation , if they ever expect to face the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> again .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is actually protecting avaricious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ice-baggers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiteers</ENAMEX> who can not see beyond their own short-term gain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> deserves an A for its quick and timely relief efforts .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , gets an A for his rote recital of economic-efficiency arguments .
     Give him an F for his failure to understand the ethics of economic equity .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> gives us an idea why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> ' predictions are usually wrong .
     They set up absurd situations , detached from reality , and then try to reason from them .
     I 'm surprised he did n't advocate letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> loot , since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and `` every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor . ''
     Price controls were `` so fervently embraced by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charleston</ENAMEX> '' because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the more insidious threats we face when dealing with disasters such as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> -- anti-profiteering ordinances such as that by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Charleston City Council</ENAMEX> as it thrashed about trying to Do Something .
     Since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinances , he did n't mention certain other of their effects .
     They divert law-enforcement resources at a time they are most needed for protecting lives and property .
     Also , rather than increase supplies , they reduce them and encourage hoarding .
     And they , or even the prospect of them , discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> .

     Would Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> also suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Red Cross</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Salvation Army</ENAMEX> , military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">police</ENAMEX> , fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> , rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> cease their efforts to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> because they interfere with his concept of the `` free market '' ?
     What about those caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> who are donating food , water and other necessities of life to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could be any of us ?
     Should they , too , stop `` messing with '' his free market ?
     Maybe he thinks they should also sell to the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder</ENAMEX> .
     And what about insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ?
     Should they be required to pay claims based on exorbitant costs for labor and materials ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> should beware , since he lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> .
     In a free market , his insurance rates can be raised to recover insurance-company losses .

     Having been through several tornadoes and hurricanes , I have a different perspective .
     Mine comes from seeing thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">communities</ENAMEX> devastated -- but only temporarily .
     Their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> .
     The shock of seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Alicia</ENAMEX> , major grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> used their truck <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleets</ENAMEX> to ship essential goods to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> , no gouging , just good will .

     We here in the affected areas were dazzled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> 's analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development .
     His theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him .
     Too bad theory fails in practice .
     We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> tend to have long memories .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> subscribing to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> 's effective price system will be remembered when normalcy returns .
     Perhaps , considering the value of our time , we will be unable to patronize their establishments in the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> era .
     I have a question for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laband</ENAMEX> : How do I explain to the single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> standing in line next to me for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the past three hours</TIMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bags of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ice</ENAMEX> she needs to keep her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's food edible will take <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">her last $ 20</NUMEX> ?
     I 'm sure she 'll appreciate what an efficient reaction to her problems the price system has created .

     This seems to be the season for revivals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cubs</ENAMEX> ' championship season ended with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National League</ENAMEX> playoffs , a revival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organic Theater</ENAMEX> 's production of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Bleacher Bums</ENAMEX> , '' a play in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> innings set in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Wrigley Field</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bleachers</ENAMEX> , continues within spitting distance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballpark</ENAMEX> .
     Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major theater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">troupes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Goodman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> .
     Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship , but both help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> remains a vital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">center</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's regional theater movement .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Goodman</ENAMEX> is offering a modernized version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moliere</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Misanthrope</ENAMEX> '' through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 4</TIMEX> .
     The original is a comedy about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alceste</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself .
     He is the jealous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philinte</ENAMEX> , and the jealous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> .
     The play is filled with intrigue , dishonesty and injustice .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Twenty-five years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wilbur</ENAMEX> modernized this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> comedy merely by avoiding `` the zounds sort of thing , '' as he wrote in his introduction .
     Otherwise , the scene remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1666</TIMEX> .
     Assuming modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> readily understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moliere</ENAMEX> 's social indictment covers their world as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Alexandrine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> verse into sprightly and theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> iambic pentameter .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> translation is remarkable -- well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity .
     But if you happen to be coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few weeks</TIMEX> , do n't fail to have a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Falls</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Misanthrope</ENAMEX> '' at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Goodman</ENAMEX> .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur </ENAMEX>'s translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> 's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Goodman</ENAMEX> 's artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , took a recent adaptation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Bartlett</ENAMEX> and significantly adapted it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had slimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moliere</ENAMEX> 's cast of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> and set them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> media world of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Thatcherite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> transfers the setting to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> , and transforms the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> into what passes for aristocracy there -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sycophants</ENAMEX> .
     It works .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> managed to more or less maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moliere</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Alexandrine</ENAMEX> verse form , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> syllable lines in rhyming couplets .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> kept the form , but Americanized it with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> 's further help .
     With a splendid cast led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Darlow</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alceste</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christina Haag</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> and , especially , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brown</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philinte</ENAMEX> who plays the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> game but harbors authentic values and feelings , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Goodman</ENAMEX> production barrels through an all-night <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> party with exuberance and wit .
     If this version , with its references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Spago</ENAMEX> and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">thirtysomething</ENAMEX> '' attracts younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> who might stay away from the classical version , then Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> are justified in abandoning Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur </ENAMEX>.
     A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">300-year-old</TIMEX> play may be easier to revive than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> merely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">25</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf Theatre Company </ENAMEX>, back from a critical and box office success in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> with its adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbeck</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Grapes of Wrath</ENAMEX> , '' opened the new season with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Pinter</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Homecoming</ENAMEX> , '' first produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Royal Shakespeare Company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1965</TIMEX> .
     Back then , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinter</ENAMEX> was not only the angry young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> , but also the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares , almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue .
     When `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Homecoming</ENAMEX> '' was first produced on this side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Atlantic</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> were reverential .
     Silences were lengthy -- nobody moved or gestured .
     Nobody smiled onstage , and nobody in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> was encouraged to laugh .
     This kind of theater was new to us .
     Also , it was not a funny time over here , what with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'68</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> convention , assassinations and riots .
     But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Perry</ENAMEX> 's direction the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> production , scheduled to play through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 19</TIMEX> , breaks through the flat and boring ritual that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Homecoming</ENAMEX> '' had become .
     Led by a near-perfect performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wilder</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> , the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's rage , bitterness , fear and isolation .
     Encouraged by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX> 's sly grins , embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX> , live off the flesh : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> is a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX> an aspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> , has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chauffeur</ENAMEX> and never seeking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy</ENAMEX> , the eldest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> , has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of philosophy at an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> .
     Though it 's clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> who held sway here until her death , now none of the other male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of this misbegotten household can challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> .
     The play concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy</ENAMEX> 's homecoming with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> .
     Curiously , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Arney</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy</ENAMEX> seems the only cast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moira Harris</ENAMEX> , a large and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who may be our next <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colleen Dewhurst</ENAMEX> , begins almost immediately to overpower each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> .
     In the end , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy</ENAMEX> returns alone to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> 's chair .
     We have seen her develop within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> from a shy and unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">in-law</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of the flesh who will replace the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> , and then some .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Grapes of Wrath</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Sagan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , quietly returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> to buy a piece of real estate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's rapidly reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">North Halsted Street</ENAMEX> restaurant and theater district .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> he hopes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> will move into a new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">theater</ENAMEX> on that site .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">troupe</ENAMEX> currently performs in a converted dairy that seats <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">211</NUMEX> and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-set production .
     `` If we wanted to stage ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Death of a Salesman</ENAMEX> , ' `` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Loman</ENAMEX> would have to live in a ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> because of the low ceiling . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> needs the extra seats even more than the fly space .
     It 's currently forced to turn away many potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,000</NUMEX> who can be accommodated in its present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">digs</ENAMEX> .
     For all the attention that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> theater has received during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> , not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> has been devoted to it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> and real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> , has put together an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> financial package that includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $ 4 million</NUMEX> of tax exempt bonds issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">State of Illinois</ENAMEX> -LRB- the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">theater</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $ 1 million</NUMEX> in grants from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Endowment for the Arts</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">MacArthur Foundation</ENAMEX> , and a few other deep pockets .
     The rest , he is confident , can be raised .
     His board <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> alone have pledged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800,000</NUMEX> and he is just beginning to massage local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> compares the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orson Welles</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mercury Theater</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'30s</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welles</ENAMEX> 's theater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> turned out to have a brief -- one might say a mercurial -- existence .
     What will Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> do with his new theater <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> if the allure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Broadway</ENAMEX> proves too much for such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalwarts</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dangerous Liaisons</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Allen</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Heidi Chronicles</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenne Headly</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Lonesome Dove</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> crumbles ?

     After enduring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> of heavy selling , the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market finally rebounded , rising sharply in hearty trading .
     The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.35</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">463.28</NUMEX> .
     It rose more than the New York Stock Exchange Composite , which improved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> .
     Among bigger stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.56</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">453.05</NUMEX> , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bruno </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> , said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     While the industrial average rallied on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's collapse , the OTC market , which did n't suffer too badly during the correction , tumbled .
     `` Our market got hit a lot harder on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> than the listed market , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We 're just recovering and getting back to business as usual .
     I 'm encouraged by the action . ''
     The trading pace was busy , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,343</NUMEX> issues and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147.6 million</NUMEX> shares changing hands .
     Advancing issues beat declining ones , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,271</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">811</NUMEX> .
     Much of the jockeying by OTC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> centered on shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> speculated about the long - and short-term implications , shares of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded .
     Heading the list : insurance , construction and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX> .
     Insurance-related stocks were mixed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said property-casualty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with the heaviest exposure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area include the OTC 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Safeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Casualty</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gilmartin</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> who follows insurance stocks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fox-Pitt Kelton</ENAMEX> , said his strategy was to sell early .
     Then , if the stocks fell sharply , he planned to begin buying them aggressively , on the theory that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     As well , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">reinsurers</ENAMEX> and insurance brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will have improved profits .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry , which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilmartin</ENAMEX> said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said .
     `` Now , they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases . ''
     Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Safeco</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 5\/8</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">462,900</NUMEX> shares .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SunGard</ENAMEX> 's stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 1\/4</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">194,000</NUMEX> shares .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guy F. Atkinson</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 7\/8</NUMEX> , on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">335,700</NUMEX> shares .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> were initially nervous about shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including many leading OTC computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of the area damaged by the quake .
     But most of those stocks fared well .

     Shares of biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in the area were also higher .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 3\/8</NUMEX> .
     The stocks of computer-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> located outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> improved , too .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 1\/2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus Development</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 1\/2</NUMEX> .

     Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after the stock market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , I called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , advised him that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late that afternoon</TIMEX> , and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> were to blame .
     They had dealt a major setback <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that afternoon</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's capital-gains tax cut proposal , which had seemed in the bag after it passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> overwhelmingly earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has it in his mind that such a tax cut would unravel the tax reform he helped engineer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     But he knows that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 20</NUMEX> of his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are disposed to vote for the cut , popular among their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds .
     He helped persuade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> to support him and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> on these grounds .
     The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 15</TIMEX> deadline , and these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> refused to agree to allow a vote to append capital gains to the budget bill , knowing it would pass .
     Denied a vote on substance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> was confronted with a hard choice .
     It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , or it could follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> strategy , to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> has been in the forefront in supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> proposal .
     It endorsed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> strategy , believing it to be the surest way to victory .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rahn</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two hours later</TIMEX> , the first word emerged on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahn</ENAMEX> was shocked , telephoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> on this issue .
     He left a message accusing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> of selling out .
     It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> , though , who had edged away from the veto strategy .
     The stock market reacted as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahn</ENAMEX> did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> 's strategy had been abandoned .
     The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's capital stock , discounted to present value .
     Why should it be so surprising that a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's capital stock ?
     The total value of privately held assets is easily <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 trillion</NUMEX> .
     The value traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 3 trillion</NUMEX> .
     If the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled , would n't the value fall to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the assets ?
     Is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> suddenly announced that if you sold it , you would be able to keep <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> more of its gain than you previously believed ?
     Indeed , the stock market 's steady advance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> tracked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> cut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's capital gains alone amounts to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 50 billion</NUMEX> .
     We 're talking real money .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rahn</ENAMEX> advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains , he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed .
     Instead , the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> instantly knocked <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> off the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahn</ENAMEX> was pointing out an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flea</ENAMEX> .
     Why is this happening ?
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , quite a number of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesmen</ENAMEX> on Wall Street are not portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets .
     They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich .
     Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and is now problematic .
     The market rebound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> followed weekend assurances from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has other plans to win the cut , which is alive and well .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run .
     It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , he thinks , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets .
     That is , with capital gains cut , the glue of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates .
     The counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are successful in killing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> because of the weakened economy .
     In this atmosphere , there would be no serious consideration of tax increases .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> would permit a vote on capital gains , though , it would pass , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> economy would be robust , and the revenue gains at every level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> 's , would be surprisingly high .
     No tax increases would be necessary .
     The struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> issued <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> in bonds in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> 's first public debt offering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> .
     Proceeds from the bonds , with coupon rates in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> range , will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> said the refinancing should save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> a year in interest payments .
     The refinancing is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> 's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem : its staggering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.5 billion</NUMEX> debt , most of which is owed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> currently plans to issue a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.7 billion</NUMEX> in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> bond issue also will help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> meet its goal of not raising rates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">another year</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F.

     The bond issue is TVA 's first public offering since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Financing Bank</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> , primarily to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> .
     But the offering almost did n't happen .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> , in fact , decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Financing Bank</ENAMEX> , which allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> to keep borrowing short term from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> after it goes to the public market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">TVA</ENAMEX> could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> in bonds break down as follows : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> bonds with a coupon rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.25 %</NUMEX> and a yield to maturity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.33 %</NUMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> bonds with a coupon rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.375 %</NUMEX> and a yield to maturity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.42 %</NUMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> call protection , a coupon rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.75 %</NUMEX> and a yield to maturity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.06 %</NUMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> owns shares in several of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> funds that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> manages , but only in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> available to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , according to filings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .

     Why did he add the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Value Fund</ENAMEX> to the list ?
     Because he 's very bullish on the emerging growth stocks that make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> 's portfolio , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> said from his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bahamas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hideaway</ENAMEX> .
     `` Emerging growth stocks have n't been popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , they 've been neglected , '' he said , and their prices often trail the market as a whole .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton </ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147,300</NUMEX>-share purchase in the closed-end fund came before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock market 's plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , but still proved slightly profitable .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> bought his shares in several separate purchases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between Aug. 30 and Sept. 28</TIMEX> , according to reports with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> .
     He bought at share prices ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.375</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.625</NUMEX> .
     The fund closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.625</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> .

     The verdict , reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> , may end an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight-year</TIMEX> legal battle for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greensboro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Beebe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> had sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">com - pany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> after installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burlington</ENAMEX> carpets in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick .
     As a result of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> said , they lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 million</NUMEX> in wages and earnings .
     In addition , they said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances .
     The case had been closely watched because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sick-building syndrome</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Plaintiffs</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Iaciofano</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burlington</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting .
     He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> ' symptoms appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">months later</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Adams</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , said the verdict would not discourage other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> from filing such suits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> are only beginning to understand what causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sick-building syndrome</ENAMEX> and much of that research was unavailable when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> filed the case , she said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">defendant</ENAMEX> in the case , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beebes</ENAMEX> have not yet decided whether to appeal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">TIMES SQUARE</ENAMEX> development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> are dealt setback .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court</ENAMEX> dismissed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> lawsuits attempting to block a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> project planned for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">42nd Street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> of the project had claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , which are co-sponsoring the project , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines .
     All but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 or so</NUMEX> lawsuits that have been filed since the project 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> approval have been dismissed before the trial stage .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that remain have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage .
     State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> 's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> in the area .
     `` This project is ready to move , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Urban Development Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Tese</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain .
     As part of the agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Park Tower Realty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Park Tower</ENAMEX> General <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Mayer</ENAMEX> said the development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> will have to review <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional lawsuits before putting up a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155 million</NUMEX> letter of credit to cover condemnation costs .
     Also , he said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> is waiting to see whether the appellate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> 's ruling will be appealed .
     The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> to a more wholesome office and theater district .
     State and city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are still negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> to renovate historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">theaters</ENAMEX> and build and operate a merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> .
     FEDERAL <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">JUDGE</ENAMEX> EXPANDS role of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> in extradition decisions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack B. Weinstein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , ruled that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> implicated in an attack on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> can be extradited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> for trial .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX> had initially refused the request , ruling that the attack had been a political act for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad</ENAMEX> , would be exempt from extradition .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> wrote in his opinion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last month</TIMEX> that terrorism and acts of war against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> can not be defined as political acts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> also ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> must consider prior to extradition whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> will be treated fairly in a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     To do so , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> must review the judicial process in the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> independently of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> 's assessment .
     He said that in this case he concurred with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> 's decision that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX> should be extradited .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> said he would appeal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> close to the case said they believed the ruling was unprecedented .
     `` Up until now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have said it is not their role to supervise the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Semmelman</ENAMEX> , the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> on the case .
     FORMER <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">CANADIAN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">AMBASSADOR</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan E. Gotlieb</ENAMEX> has joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepper , Hamilton &amp; Scheetz</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gotlieb </ENAMEX>, who serves as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stikeman , Elliott</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's biggest law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , is advising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepper Hamilton</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> on legal matters related to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> investment , corporate finance and international transactions .
     QUOTABLE :
     In a speech prepared for delivery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Powell</ENAMEX> contested the notion that the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> ... .
     I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">past years</TIMEX> , with a grain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">salt</ENAMEX> .
     In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .

     -LRB- During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past century</TIMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">YOM KIPPUR WAR</ENAMEX> , WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">EGYPT</ENAMEX> CRASHED into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 6 , 1973</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the holiest day</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> calendar , lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">barely a month</TIMEX> .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> far-afield effect is still with us .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">states</ENAMEX> , always bitterly resentful of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> support toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> , realized they held an irresistable weapon -- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> .
     Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> jacked up prices sharply .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 22</TIMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , the world 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">exporter</ENAMEX> , they embargoed oil shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> 's staunchest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">ally</ENAMEX> .
     The timing was perfect .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arabs</ENAMEX> had tried embargos before .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1956</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Egypt</ENAMEX> to seize the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">producers</ENAMEX> cut off supplies to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Texas</ENAMEX> simply pumped harder .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil supplies , however , had peaked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> were declining .
     Imports , then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">six million barrels</NUMEX> a day , came primarily from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East</ENAMEX> supplies were growing in importance .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was bringing in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">two million barrels</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> oil a day , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">17.3 million barrels</NUMEX> consumed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> .
     Politics and economics conspired .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , far more dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mideast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , would n't offend the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arabs</ENAMEX> or trade off their precious supplies .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> did manage to supply the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> by relabeling supplies ; once <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> is shipped , no one can tell its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> .
     But car-happy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> panicked , and so did the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other oil-consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> .
     `` Shortage '' and `` crisis '' became buzz words , although neither really applied .
     The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion -LRB- much of it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> -RRB- , though that was cold comfort for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> waiting in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">mile</NUMEX>-long lines at the gas pumps .
     The embargo lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only six months</TIMEX> , but the price hikes became a fact of life .
     What the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arabs</ENAMEX> started , inflation finished .
     Once and for all , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5</NUMEX>-a-barrel crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35-cents</NUMEX>-a-gallon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> were history .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times</ENAMEX> may be tough on Wall Street for some , but a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> are making as much as ever -- or more .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns Cos.</ENAMEX> , for example , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive officers</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan `` Ace '' Greenberg</ENAMEX> got a pay increase to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35.9 million</NUMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">14-month</TIMEX> period ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.9 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended April 30 , 1988</TIMEX> .
     The figures do n't include substantial dividends on holdings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> stock .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> himself was paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 million</NUMEX> , before <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 1.5 million</NUMEX> in dividends , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year before</TIMEX> .
     The increase is noted in the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's latest proxy statement filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
     Because it operates on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a fiscal year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">yearly</TIMEX> filings are available much earlier than those of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     The latest period includes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">14 months</TIMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> changed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a fiscal year ending in June</TIMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX> stock and bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> saw thinner paychecks over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> says reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> reported improved earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its first quarter , ended Sept. 29</TIMEX> , partly because of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> increase in commissions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Montgoris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , defended the lofty salaries at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> .
     `` All of us are on a base salary of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> makes nothing -- and that 's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montgoris</ENAMEX> said .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> has never had an unprofitable year since its founding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">65 years ago</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> besides the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">62-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> were paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million</NUMEX> or more before dividends for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 14 months ended in June</TIMEX> .
     According to the proxy statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Cayne</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.9 million</NUMEX> ; an executive vic<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">e </ENAMEX>president , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael L. Tarnopol</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">53</TIMEX> , made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 3.4 million</NUMEX> ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice presidents</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent J. Mattone</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">44</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Michaelcheck</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">42</TIMEX> , made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3.3 million</NUMEX> each .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montgoris</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has a `` straight mathematical formula '' for determining compensation , based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's earnings .
     `` Just because a particular element of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is down , '' such as stockbrokerage , `` does n't mean the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> should be paid less , '' he said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Grenfell Group PLC</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Craven</ENAMEX> , group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , is taking over the chairmanship of the merchant banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Carey </ENAMEX>, who is retiring .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX> will remain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craven</ENAMEX> is widely credited with refocusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> 's energies on its core corporate finance , fund management and banking activities over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> .
