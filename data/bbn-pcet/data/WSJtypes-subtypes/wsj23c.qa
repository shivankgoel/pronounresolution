     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> , is lowering its circulation guarantee to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second consecutive year</TIMEX> , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways .
     In an announcement to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> ; and increase the cost of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> subscription rate by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 4 to $ 55</NUMEX> .
     In a related development , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">news-weekly</ENAMEX> , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">the fourth year</TIMEX> in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> ; a full , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-color page in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 120,000</NUMEX> .
     However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 %</NUMEX> higher per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Heinemann</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> is following the course of some other mass-circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reader 's Digest</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCall 's</ENAMEX> , and most recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TV Guide</ENAMEX> , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> in the hyper-competitive world of magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">news-weeklies</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> , as part of the more cost-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .
     Besides , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> think selling a news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> with a clock radio is tacky .
     `` Giveaways just give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the wrong image , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann</ENAMEX> .
     `` That perception takes the focus off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers</ENAMEX> .
     `` What we are doing is screening out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who are only casually related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann</ENAMEX> .
     `` We are trying to create quality and involvement . ''
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> used the same explanation when in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1988</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> cut its guaranteed circulation from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3 million</NUMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's paid circulation , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Audit Bureau of Circulations</ENAMEX> , dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,393,237</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the six months ended June 30 , 1989</TIMEX> .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's move is being received well , once again .
     `` It 's terrific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">advertisers</ENAMEX> to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will be paying more , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Drexler</ENAMEX> , national media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bozell Inc.</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     `` A few drops in circulation are of no consequence .
     It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann</ENAMEX> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> 's net revenue per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> , or the actual revenue from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away .
     `` The question is how much are we getting from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinemann</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">news-weeklies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. News &amp; World Report</ENAMEX> , are less reliant on electronic giveaways , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> both have been increasing their circulation rate bases .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> .

<DOCNO> WSJ2351 </DOCNO>
     When the news broke of an attempted coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Dodd</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> for a briefing .
     `` They said , ` follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> , ' '' he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     That shows how far <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> has come since its birth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nine years ago</TIMEX> , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news .
     It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> of any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> .
     Its niche as the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> of record '' during major crises draws elite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> around the world .
     But for all its success , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> has hit a plateau .
     Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> worry that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV .
     `` Just the fact we 're on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> is no longer bulletin , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Turner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     `` You ca n't live on that . ''
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> , is trying to reposition itself as a primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channel</ENAMEX> , or what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</TIMEX> , to kick off the effort , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> will premiere its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> prime-time newscast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourlong</TIMEX> show at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 p.m . Eastern time</TIMEX> to air head-to-head against the network newscasts .
     The show will be co-anchored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Crier</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">34-year-old</TIMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> and campus beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> who has never held a job in television or journalism .
     The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> .
     To distinguish itself , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> is also expanding international coverage and adding a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> global-news program .
     It is paying higher salaries -- after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> .
     And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> .
     `` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Petrovich</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Headline News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN </ENAMEX>'s sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     But that wo n't be easy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Networks</ENAMEX> , like other consumer products , develop images in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> ' minds that are n't easy to change .
     It also takes money that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> will tune in specially to see .
     And the cable-TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributors</ENAMEX> and part <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> -- like things just the way they are .
     The repositioning bid is aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive .
     Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> is facing stronger competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial News Network Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Consumer News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Channel</ENAMEX> , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future .
     In addition , many cable-TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">systems</ENAMEX> themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> wants to change its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> ' habits .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grazers</ENAMEX> '' and news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkies</ENAMEX> , who spend an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 26 minutes</TIMEX> a day watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> , according to audience research .
     That 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one-third</NUMEX> the time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> watch the major broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> .
     The brief attention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's viewer habits have been molded by its format .
     Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service .
     It focused on building up its news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureaus</ENAMEX> around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> .
     It filled its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> schedule with newscasts called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Daybreak</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Daywatch</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Newsday</ENAMEX> , '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Newsnight</ENAMEX> , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .
     Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows .
     `` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Amos </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for programming .
     Accordingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> is adding a world-affairs show in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> because surveys show <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">its global-news hour</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> ' minds , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos </ENAMEX>.
     And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Larry King Live</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Crossfire</ENAMEX> '' talk shows , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> hope will keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tuned in .
     Then there 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The World Today</ENAMEX> , '' the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crier</ENAMEX> .
     Until now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> has featured its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> gossip show during the key <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> period .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of the cable-television-equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> that watch news do so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m.</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> discovered , so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> wants in .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> will probably do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's other newcasts .
     Some in the industry are skeptical .
     `` I find it hard to conceive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> switching over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> for what , at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> 's mind , is the same news , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuven Frank</ENAMEX> , the former <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Huntley-Brinkley Report</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> news is also slated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> hired award-winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela Hill</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of news specials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> .
     She 's assembling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35</NUMEX> investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> who will produce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> '' did so well for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> .
     That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces .
     `` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Mosettig</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</ENAMEX> , who notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> is indispensable to his job .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> recently gave most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> raises of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 %</NUMEX> , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> .
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosettig</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything .
     But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     In any case , cable-TV-system <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> have reason to fear any tinkering with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> 's format .
     They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNN</ENAMEX> seeks to discourage .
     `` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest , long-format programming , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stengel</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , programming , of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Cablevision Inc.</ENAMEX> , which holds a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Corp. of America</ENAMEX> withdrew from regulators its application to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> , leaving the transaction in limbo .
     The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial Corp.</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> withdrew its application from the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> because of an informal notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial </ENAMEX>'s thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> failed to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Community Reinvestment Act</ENAMEX> requirements .

     Call it the `` we 're too broke to fight '' defense .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of insolvent savings and loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">associations</ENAMEX> are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> claim that the suits , numbering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700 to 1,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;Ls</ENAMEX> nor the extinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> has the money to pay judgments .
     Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&amp;L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> concede there 's little precedent to back their position .
     Still , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have renewed their arguments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> where the defense is permitted under state law .
     The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> and reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC</ENAMEX> 's massive legal bills , which topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 73 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The S&amp;L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> were encouraged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> by an appellate-court ruling in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases brought against defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt Savings &amp; Loan Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch</ENAMEX> , best known as the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Dallas Cowboys</ENAMEX> football <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> foreclosed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ranch</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC</ENAMEX> argued to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt Savings</ENAMEX> nor any means to collect from any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">party</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` If true , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . ''
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> said it lacked enough financial information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FSLIC</ENAMEX> and sent the cases back to federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Haworth</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> , says he plans to file a brief <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> urging the district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> to dismiss the suits , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> 's liabilities exceeded its assets by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion</NUMEX> when federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> closed it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1988</TIMEX> .
     `` This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> is just brain dead , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haworth </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Andrews &amp; Kurth</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Triland Investment Group</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch</ENAMEX> , dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Jackson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> says a judgment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Triland</ENAMEX> could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> 's foreclosure on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Valley Ranch</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     After falling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months</TIMEX> , the producer price index for finished goods shot up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> .
     Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said it did play a role in the market 's decline .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> , as evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> had hoped .
     Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> from easing credit , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that retail sales grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145.21 billion</NUMEX> .

     `` The overall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Richards </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Manufacturers</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung Won Sohn</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norwest Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , blamed rising energy prices and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn</TIMEX> increase in car prices for most of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> jump .
     `` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said .
     `` The core rate is not really out of line . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">All year</TIMEX> , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> receive for goods .
     Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last winter</TIMEX> , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rates .
     Energy prices then plummeted through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> , causing the index to decline for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months</TIMEX> .
     Overall , the index has climbed at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.1 %</NUMEX> compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of the year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> said .
     While far more restrained than the pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the beginning of the year</TIMEX> , that is still a steeper rise than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.0 %</NUMEX> increase for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's good inflation news may have ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , when energy prices zoomed up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> after plunging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead</TIMEX> , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> had expected that the climb in oil prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> climb was higher than most anticipated .
     `` I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mueller </ENAMEX>, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Mueller Cannon</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> economic forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     He predicted that inflation will moderate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirk Van Dongen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors</ENAMEX> , said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> figure suggests .
     `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .
     Passenger car prices jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , after climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and declining in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> increase was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time event , coming as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> introduced their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> .
     Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn</TIMEX> increase .
     Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , while prices for home electronic equipment fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 %</NUMEX> .
     Food prices declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6 %</NUMEX> , after climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32.82 billion</NUMEX> .
     But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     Sales at general merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> after declining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , while sales of building materials fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> after rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> .
     Producer prices for intermediate goods grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , after dropping for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three consecutive months</TIMEX> .
     Prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 %</NUMEX> after declining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and edging up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     Here are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department </ENAMEX>'s producer price indexes -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> -RRB- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> said it expects to report a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 485,000</NUMEX> , but no per-share earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Atherton </ENAMEX>, said the loss stems from several factors .
     He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 700 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 516 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">between June and September</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 85 %</NUMEX> of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets .
     Accordingly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> estimated that it will provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 85 million and $ 110 million</NUMEX> for credit losses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> as part of the current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">City Federal Savings Bank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> 's primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Somerset</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">City Federal</ENAMEX> operates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atherton</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> divest themselves of such bonds .
     That action , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> said , will result in a charge against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $ 30 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CityFed</ENAMEX> also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations .
     All these actions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atherton</ENAMEX> said , will result in a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125 million to $ 150 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     He added , however : `` Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">City Federal</ENAMEX> currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> could significantly exceed this range .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust Savings Bank</ENAMEX> said federal thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of preferred stock , indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> ' concerns about the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> have heightened .
     In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> cited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Regulators</ENAMEX> also ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> to stop buying back the preferred stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David L. Paul </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , criticized the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> , which issued the directive , saying it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> will try to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> to reverse the decision .
     The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> have deep concerns about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> 's health .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> a `` troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months ended June 30</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> had a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.3 million</NUMEX> , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52.8 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> , holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> , it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 890 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.35 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $ 150 million</NUMEX> of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
     The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> and do n't have a ready market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> has been hounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> to provide current market values for its holdings , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Regulators</ENAMEX> have become increasingly antsy about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust 's</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market .
     The legislation requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> common shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> .
     In a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> challenged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> ' decision , saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> . ''
     He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.5 million</NUMEX> to its general reserves .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> should instead move ahead with approving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> 's request to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Bank</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> sale is the centerpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;L</ENAMEX> from a high-flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , long before now .
     Many interpret the delay as an indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> are skeptical about the proposal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Branches</ENAMEX> and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> take over an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> , however , touts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> sale , saying it would bring in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> and reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's assets to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.7 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9 billion</NUMEX> .
     It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 82 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1.2 %</NUMEX> of assets , from a negative <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</NUMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , thus bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> close to regulatory standards .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> sale would also reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's large amount of good will by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 180 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> , however , say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> sale will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> counters that he intends to further pare the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CenTrust</ENAMEX> by not renewing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> , as required under the new thrift law .

     On a recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , in the midst of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's most popular prime-time show , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant</ENAMEX> bet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> that she could name any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cheeses</ENAMEX> after just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nibble , while blindfolded .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> won the bet .
     But perhaps even more remarkable , the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX>-show , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wetten Dass</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Make a Bet</ENAMEX> -RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> .
     As the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> economic integration approaches , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> have taken to the ramparts against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dallas</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Miami Vice</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">L.A.

     But much of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out .
     The most militant opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> TV imports has come from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> television and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , who have demanded quotas ensuring that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a full 60 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's TV shows be produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail .
     A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> television dial suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why .
     While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect .
     More <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> air time is filled with low-budget game shows , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">variety hours</TIMEX> , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock-offs of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> counterparts .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's most popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> programs features <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">semi-celebrities</ENAMEX> seeking out their grammar-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> for on-air reunions .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> game show has as its host a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> pretending to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's favorite shows , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Fantastico</ENAMEX> , '' a tepid variety show , is so popular that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> clamored to buy a chocolate product , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cacao Fantastico</ENAMEX> , '' whose praises were sung <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each week</TIMEX> by dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">showgirls</ENAMEX> -- even though the product did n't exist .
     Topping the cheese stunt , on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another typical evening</TIMEX> of fun on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Wetten Dass</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant</ENAMEX> won a bet with the show 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gottschalk</ENAMEX> , that he could identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> dialects over the telephone .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt</ENAMEX> nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans-Dietrich Genscher</ENAMEX> frying and selling their combined weight in potato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pancakes</ENAMEX> .
     If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> programs usually target only their own local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> , and often only a small portion of that .
     Mega-hits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> rarely make it even to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain</ENAMEX> , and almost never show up on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> screens .
     Attempts to produce `` pan-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> co-production , the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX>-long `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Eurovision Song Contest</ENAMEX> , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show .
     Another , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Jeux Sans Frontieres</ENAMEX> , '' where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> from assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made imitation under the title `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Almost Anything Goes</ENAMEX> '' flopped fast .
     For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cream</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> crop , the literary dramas that are shown on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> public television as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Masterpiece Theater</ENAMEX> , '' make up a relatively small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> air time .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> programming is more of an acquired taste .
     There is , for instance , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">One Man and His Dog</ENAMEX> , '' a herding contest among sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> .
     Also riveting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of dart-throwing championships , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">even more hours</TIMEX> of lawn bowling contests and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">still more hours</TIMEX> of snooker marathons .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes .
     The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> knock-off of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Dallas</ENAMEX> , '' called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chateauvallon</ENAMEX> '' and set in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">vineyard</ENAMEX> , had a good run in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , which ended after the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lead</ENAMEX> was injured in a real-life auto accident .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Schwarzwaldklinik</ENAMEX> , '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Black Forest Clinic</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">St . Elsewhere</ENAMEX> '' set in a health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">spa</ENAMEX> , is popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> , and has spread into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's most popular series is a drama called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">La Piovra</ENAMEX> , '' or `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Octopus</ENAMEX> , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palermo</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mafia</ENAMEX> .
     It was front-page news in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> when the fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> was gunned down in the series .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> 's most popular mini-series <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> was `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Juncal</ENAMEX> , '' the story of an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bullfighter</ENAMEX> .
     `` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> programs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Wenham</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of programs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Broadcasting Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` Given a choice , everybody will watch a home-produced show . ''
     But frequently there is n't much choice .
     Thus , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal .
     `` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to make shows that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will want to see , '' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Young</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">National Film Theatre School</ENAMEX> .
     While some in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> TV industry 's sluggish development .
     Until recently , national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising .
     Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> programs are .
     But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .
     Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> authorized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels</ENAMEX> for the first time ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channels</ENAMEX> .
     The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
     But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sky Channel</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian-American</ENAMEX> press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     The financially struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> 's other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> .
     In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Madrid</ENAMEX> hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> recently , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Great Barrier Reef</ENAMEX> , only to be urged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Skippy the Kangaroo</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson-CSF S.A.</ENAMEX> said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> , greatly expanding collaboration between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , which may be dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurodynamics</ENAMEX> , would have combined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least # 1.4 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.17 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- and would be among the world 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> of talks , plans for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> are sufficiently advanced for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government clearance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> hope for a final agreement by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , and help make them a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> defense contracting .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , a string of cross-border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mergers</ENAMEX> and joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> have reshaped the once-balkanized world of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> manufacture .
     Already , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> government-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson-CSF</ENAMEX> collaborate on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week</TIMEX> they announced they may make a joint bid to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX> , a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     The sudden romance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson-CSF</ENAMEX> -- traditionally bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East</ENAMEX> and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> 's defense industry .
     Most threatened by closer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace-Thomson</ENAMEX> ties would be their respective national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra S.A.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co. PLC</ENAMEX> .
     But neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC </ENAMEX>-- unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> -- are sitting quietly by as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> join forces .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> confirmed that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> may join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> fight , as part of a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">consortium</ENAMEX> that would bid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Thomson-CSF</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> has had talks about a possible joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> bid include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dowty Group PLC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dassault</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     But it may be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> and its potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> decide whether to bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> indicated .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> plans <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> 's financial accounts , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">auditors</ENAMEX> recently said included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 215 million</NUMEX> in fictitious contracts at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Signal &amp; Control Group</ENAMEX> , with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> merged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Also , any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> bid might be blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> may heighten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">British Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> worries about concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's defense industry .
     A consortium bid , however , would diminish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> 's direct role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> and might consequently appease ministry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> : `` Competition is the name of the game , '' she said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra</ENAMEX> , insists it is n't interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> .
     The missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting .
     For both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East</ENAMEX> sales , a traditional mainstay for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' exports , have been hurt by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> of weak oil prices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> 's importance for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> is great .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siemens AG</ENAMEX> recently joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GEC</ENAMEX> in a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Plessey Co.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler-Benz</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> is already overshadowed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> and by its home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aerospatiale S.A.</ENAMEX> ; to better compete , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say , they need a partnership .
     To justify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> ownership of the planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> would make a cash payment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Annual</TIMEX> revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> 's missile business is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 950 million</NUMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> 's chief missile products include its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">17-year-old</TIMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Rapier</ENAMEX> surface-to-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> missile products , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> revenue , include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Crotale</ENAMEX> surface-to-air missile family .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial Pipe Line Co.</ENAMEX> said it will delay a proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-step , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">830 million Canadian-dollar</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 705.6 million</NUMEX> -RRB- expansion of its system because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's output of crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> is shrinking .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's biggest oil pipeline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> and a major transporter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , said revised industry forecasts indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> oil output will total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 1.64 million barrels</NUMEX> a day by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> lower than a previous estimate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> production averaged <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 1.69 million barrels</NUMEX> a day during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989 's first half</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</NUMEX> below the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> level .
     `` The capability of existing fields to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> shift their emphasis to natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Watkins</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for government and industry relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interhome Energy Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins</ENAMEX> said volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> 's system is down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> .
     `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .
     Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> say the outlook for natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> is better than it is for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .
     The number of active drilling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rigs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> is down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , and the number of completed oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Feick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins</ENAMEX> said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> transports <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75 %</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> produced in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 60 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> 's total volume consists of light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> .
     Nearly all of the crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is transported on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> 's system , whose main line runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Edmonton</ENAMEX> to major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> region , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Buffalo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montreal</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 600,000 barrels</NUMEX> a day , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9.1 %</NUMEX> of net <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> imports , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lichtblau</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Petroleum Industry Research Foundation</ENAMEX> .
     That ranks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-largest source of imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichtblau</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , will help intensify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> from overseas , particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's very much a growing concern .
     But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichtblau</ENAMEX> stressed that the delay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dependence on offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , however , since <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> imports are limited in any case by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> 's falling output .
     Under terms of its proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interprovincial</ENAMEX> intended to add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">200,000 barrels</NUMEX> a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     The system currently has a capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">1.55 million barrels</NUMEX> a day .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland Steel Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> expects to report that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter</TIMEX> as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45.3 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> a share , including a pretax charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 million</NUMEX> related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.11 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">200,000 tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .
     The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Joseph T. Ryerson &amp; Son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments , which should result in improved results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland</ENAMEX> said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results will be announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier third quarter</TIMEX> , when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 61 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.70</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> .

     Predicting the financial results of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> has been a tough job lately .
     Take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> , the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years past</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock , which lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.25</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52</NUMEX> in national over-the-counter trading .
     But that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">all of three months ago</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> said it expects revenue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> to increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> .
     The announcement caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock to surge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.50</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75.50</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> 's surprising strength is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example of the difficulty facing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's hard to know what to expect at this point , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Rogers</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robertson Stephens &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` The industry defies characterization . ''
     To illustrate , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> said that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> computer-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> he follows , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> will report for their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">most recent quarter</TIMEX> earnings below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's results , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> above those results .
     Among those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> expected to have a down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amdahl Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> , generally solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers</ENAMEX> in the past .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> also is expected to report disappointing results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept .</TIMEX>
     Another contradictory message comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Businessland Inc.</ENAMEX> , a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reported that booming sales of new personal computers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> had resulted in net income more than doubling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter ended June 30</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month</TIMEX> , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Businessland</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> that results for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> had n't met expectations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it expects earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 to 17 cents</NUMEX> a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> a share in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period .
     While the earnings picture confuses , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> say the major forces expected to shape the industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming year</TIMEX> are clearer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> will continue to war over standards .
     In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .
     Until recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> had a lock on the market for image software , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> rebelled .
     Now the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are collaborating on an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> 's approach , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say they are likely to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> of personal computers , along with them .
     The short-term outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> 's business , however , appears strong .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being heralded as a boon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of low-end printers sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple </ENAMEX>.
     The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Warnock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adobe </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mountain View</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has been receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> generally .
     `` It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Crabs</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soundview Financial Group</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crabs</ENAMEX> said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of a widely used computer publishing program .
     He expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus</ENAMEX> to report earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21 cents</NUMEX> a share on revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.5 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</NUMEX> a share on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.4 million</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aldus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment .
     On the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant .
     A bus is the data highway within a computer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is backing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of bus called microchannel , while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> other leading computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H-P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> , have chosen another method .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> do n't care about the bus , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Benton</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> computers , for instance , uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different buses `` and no one seems to mind . ''
     The gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">winners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">laggards</ENAMEX> will grow .
     In personal computers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> are expected to tighten their hold on their business .
     At the same time , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-tier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will continue to lose ground .
     Some lagging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> even may leave the personal computer business altogether .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse Technology</ENAMEX> , for instance , is considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidate</ENAMEX> to sell its troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse</ENAMEX> has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimball Brown</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> estimates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wyse</ENAMEX> , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents</NUMEX> a share for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its quarter ended Sept</TIMEX> .
     Personal-computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more microprocessors as their `` brains , '' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">guys</ENAMEX> that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benton </ENAMEX>.
     As a result of this trend , longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">powerhouses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H-P</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own .
     But they will have to act quickly .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benton</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> to unveil a family of high-end personal computers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this year</TIMEX> that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines .
     A raft of new computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> also has targeted this `` server '' market .

     Population Drain Ends For Midwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">States</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">IOWA</ENAMEX> IS MAKING a comeback .
     So are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> is on the upswing , according to new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> estimates , following declines throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> .
     The gains , to be sure , are rather small .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , for instance , saw its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> grow by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">between 1987 and 1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> says .
     Still , even that modest increase is good news for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> that had n't grown at all since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Between 1987 and 1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Dakota</ENAMEX> was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> , a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> midwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have been growing steadily since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> has been holding its own in the population race .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have grown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , which lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> .
     And although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> suffered slight declines earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the decade</TIMEX> , they are growing again .
     At the same time , several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> have had their own population turnaround .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> that grew in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> are now losing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Montana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> .
     Overall , though , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> still outpace the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> , and fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> ensure that the pattern will continue .
     But the growth gap between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Sun Belt</ENAMEX> and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
     More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly</ENAMEX> Maintain Their Independence
     THANKS TO modern medicine , more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> are growing old together .
     And even after losing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> , more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> are staying independent .
     A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> study of the noninstitutionalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> shows that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 65 to 74</TIMEX> were living with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     This does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone , however .
     That share has remained at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 24 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     What has changed is that more of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> are living with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> rather than with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 65 to 74 lived</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get even older , many become widowed .
     But even among those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 75 and older</TIMEX> , the share living with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> rose slightly , to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     Like their younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> , the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> are less likely to live with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 17 %</NUMEX> of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 75 and older</TIMEX> lived with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     The likelihood of living alone beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the age of 75</TIMEX> has increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</NUMEX> .
     More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .
     Careers Count Most For the Well-to-Do
     MANY AFFLUENT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> place personal success and money above <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> .
     At least that 's what a survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman</ENAMEX> indicates .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two-thirds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than half</NUMEX> said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> .
     Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-rich</ENAMEX> .
     Average household income for the sample was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 194,000</NUMEX> , and average net assets were reported as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 775,000</NUMEX> .
     The goal was to learn about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's fastest-growing income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> , the upper-middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> .
     Although they represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> , they control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one-third</NUMEX> of discretionary income .
     Across the board , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive .
     Despite their considerable incomes and assets , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> in the study do n't feel financially secure , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fourth</NUMEX> do n't feel that they have made it .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty percent</NUMEX> do n't even feel they are financially well off .
     Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">affluent</ENAMEX> are n't comfortable with themselves , either .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 40 %</NUMEX> do n't feel they 're more able than others .
     While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twothirds</NUMEX> feel some guilt about being affluent , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25 %</NUMEX> give <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,500</NUMEX> or more to charity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five percent</NUMEX> attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles .

     THE NUMBER of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> who hold jobs in top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> has more than doubled since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bankers Association</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> .
     The share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> in those positions has risen to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> ... .
     Per-capita personal income in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> grew faster than inflation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bureau of Economic Analysis .</ENAMEX>
     The amount of income divvied up for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16,489</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.6 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15,472</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Per capita personal income ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11,116</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23,059</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> ... .
     There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in college <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Center for Education Statistics</ENAMEX> estimates .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 54 %</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> are part-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> .

     Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> .
     More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Hill</ENAMEX> , the con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Willson</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Music Man</ENAMEX> , '' warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">River City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , against the game .
     Now kindred spirits on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison</ENAMEX> 's town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> have barred the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> 's fanciest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Grand Kempinski</ENAMEX> , from installing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> free pool tables in its new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounge</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Spruill</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">halls</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison</ENAMEX> 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> 's , warned that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">alcohol</ENAMEX> leads to betting , which leads to fights . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> claim has been maligned unjustly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     `` Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Manske</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Pocket Billiards Association</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pool</ENAMEX> is hot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , he insists , where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables .
     With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't want to just sit around and drink . ''
     Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Grand Kempinski</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200</NUMEX> a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.50</NUMEX> a pop .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lounge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dyer</ENAMEX> wo n't admit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> in jeans , T-shirts or tennis shoes .
     But a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> did n't buy those arguments .
     Introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> , argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Councilwoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riley Reinker</ENAMEX> , would be `` dangerous .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addison</ENAMEX> is no stranger to cans of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> , either .
     After its previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> committed suicide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , an investigation disclosed that town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and dipped into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> 's coffers for trips and retreats .
     The revelations embarrassed town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> suggested .
     Now comes the pool flap .

     Of all the ethnic tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> , which is the most troublesome right now ?
     A good bet would be the tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> .
     Or so it must seem to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> , the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> appearing in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> sitcom airing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30-10 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Not only is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> , '' he 's also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inheritor</ENAMEX> of a comedic tradition dating back to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Duck Soup</ENAMEX> , '' and he 's currently a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in hot water .
     Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's remarks , quoted <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Village Voice</ENAMEX> while he was a paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> mayoral campaign , and then in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> after he and the campaign parted company .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> said that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> feel guilty toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> , so they support black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> uncritically .
     He said that many black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> uncritically .
     He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> have contributed more to black causes over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> than vice versa .
     Of course , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> did not use neutral language .
     As a practitioner of ethnic humor from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the old days</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Borscht Belt</ENAMEX> , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> instinctively reached for the vernacular .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> 's black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> , `` a fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shvartze</ENAMEX> with a mustache . ''
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> , would the water be quite so hot ?
     It probably would , because few or none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> upset by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .
     In addition , some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .
     For example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NAACP</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> is `` like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .
     The latter typically is the humor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog</ENAMEX> , and it was perfected by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jews</ENAMEX> on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> along with themselves .
     In the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zealot</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce</ENAMEX> , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to ribbons .
     But wielded by a pro like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> , it is a constructive form of mischief .
     Why constructive ?
     Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> in conflict .
     That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> , on college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">campuses</ENAMEX> and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Kristol</ENAMEX> wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''
     The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?
     Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .
     It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> vs. blue-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Bostonians</ENAMEX> in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Cheers</ENAMEX> '' ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Cosby Show</ENAMEX> . ''
     But these are not the differences that make headlines .
     In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor</ENAMEX> courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddie</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Redgrave</ENAMEX> -RRB- , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> , against the wishes of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Karin</ENAMEX> -RRB- and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Maggart</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     It 's worth noting that both disapproving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> .
     At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddie</ENAMEX> .
     It could n't be more obvious that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> '' is being made from an old recipe .
     And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Orthodox Jew</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Nation of Islam</ENAMEX> .
     Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> , the play and movie versions of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Abie 's Irish Rose</ENAMEX> '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> so popular that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Nichols</ENAMEX> , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .
     And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS</ENAMEX> sitcom called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bridget Loves Bernie</ENAMEX> , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Baxter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Birney</ENAMEX> .
     Clearly , the question with `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX> '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .
     So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
     Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the didactic days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Lear</ENAMEX> , to preach about social issues .
     To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> dislikes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> not because he 's a shrewd <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> , but because he quits his well-paying job as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> in order to become a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> .
     Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's comic persona .
     The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> mischief to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as well as to himself .
     But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .
     I 'm not suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> start putting together episodes about topics like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Catholic</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> dispute over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Carmelite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">convent</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> .
     That issue , like racial tensions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .
     But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> .
     At your age , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie </ENAMEX>, you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> 's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> voted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87-7</NUMEX> to approve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 13.5 billion</NUMEX> measure that had been stripped of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases .
     `` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut .
     In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> includes a capital-gains provision .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiations are likely to begin at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midweek</TIMEX> and last for a while .
     `` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> side , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     But , he added , `` I believe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> will work together to get capital-gains reform <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill .
     `` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , that will help a great deal . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> 's decision was a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> of the cut are playing hardball .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut .
     And a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .
     Such legislation must be enacted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Because the legislation has n't been completed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight</TIMEX> to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit-reduction law .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> to agree to the streamlined bill .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> appears reluctant to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> .
     A key is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> are willing to acquiesce to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> ' decision to drop many pet provisions .
     `` Although I am encouraged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> action , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill .</ENAMEX> -RRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> . ''
     Another big question hovering over the debate is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> thinks .
     He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed bill .
     These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures .
     Also missing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> 's repeal of a law , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 89</ENAMEX> , that compels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to give rank-and-file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> comparable health benefits to top paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> high-profile provision that was originally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> said he hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> will consider that measure soon .
     To the delight of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> , the bill dropped a plan passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> .
     To the detriment of many low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , efforts to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken .
     Asked why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> were giving up so much , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici</ENAMEX> , the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> , said , `` We 're looking like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX> .
     Things had just gone too far . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> said that the move required sacrifice by every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> .
     It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> also dropped a plan by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits reduced .
     In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> excise tax on long-distance telephone calls .
     It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting , which is used by military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> to reduce their tax burden .
     It also drops a provision that would have permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> .
     Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX> penalties , which would have raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     A provision that would have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX> an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> was excised .
     The approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill was especially sweet for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> , who had proposed the streamlining .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> 's relations with Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> chose to bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> and deal with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> during a dispute over drug funding in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> supplemental spending bill .
     The deficit reduction bill contains <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.3 billion</NUMEX> in tax increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     The revenue-raising provisions , which affect mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , would :
     -- Prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 2 , 1989</TIMEX> .
     -- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the date</TIMEX> that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the tax bill is enacted .
     -- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 6 , 1989</TIMEX> , that has been exploited by investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bankers</ENAMEX> in corporate takeovers .
     The measure repeals a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> exclusion given to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 30 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     -- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments .
     -- Raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 851 million</NUMEX> by suspending for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes .
     -- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1990</TIMEX> .
     -- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> , such as those used in air conditioners and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Styrofoam</ENAMEX> , beginning at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.10</NUMEX> a pound starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     -- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> currently exempt from withholding .
     -- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">semimonthly</TIMEX> , effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     -- Restrict the ability of real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> to escape taxes by swapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash .
     -- Increase to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6</NUMEX> a person from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> the international air-passenger departure tax , and impose a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX>-a-person tax on international departures by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> .
     The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees .
     Among its provisions :
     -- Reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> by some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</NUMEX> , in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> .
     The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     -- Removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Postal Service</ENAMEX> 's operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.77 billion</NUMEX> .
     A similar provision is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> version .
     -- Authority for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 239 million</NUMEX> by charging fees for commercial airline-landing rights at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">LaGuardia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">John F.

     -- Increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX> fees totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million</NUMEX> .
     -- Direction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> to collect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> services .
