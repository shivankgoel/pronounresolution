     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it lowered ratings on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 650 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice Co.</ENAMEX> debt , citing the closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's proposed recapitalization .

     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> announced their last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> had left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> , the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria .
     It was `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> would fall .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> would rush <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> .
     A resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would walk into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> .
     Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Eight months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Gromov</ENAMEX> walked across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> remains in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> sit in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">camps</ENAMEX> , and the restoration of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> freedom seems as far off as ever .
     But there never was a chance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> would overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> quickly and easily .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> said they would support their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clients</ENAMEX> by all means necessary -- and did .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> said it would fully support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> -- and did n't .
     With the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1987</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.N.</ENAMEX> accords `` relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control .
     The terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Geneva accords</ENAMEX> leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> free to provide its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> with assistance of any kind -- including the return of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> -- while requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to cut off aid .
     The only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ointment</ENAMEX> was the last-minute addition of a unilateral <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> caveat , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> would continue as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> did .
     But as soon as the accords were signed , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> sharply reduced aid .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1989</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> said they had completed their pullout , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> cut it further .
     Not so the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gromov</ENAMEX> himself said <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> expected to leave behind <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> of military equipment and installations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">regime</ENAMEX> .
     Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troop</ENAMEX> withdrawal , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> has poured in an additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 to $ 300 million</NUMEX> worth per month -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 2 billion</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> , equivalent to the total <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nine years</TIMEX> .
     This includes what Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuli Vorontsov</ENAMEX> fetchingly called `` new peaceful long-range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> , '' including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">SCUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early May</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> had delivered , for example , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tanks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">artillery</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of other combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Later that month</TIMEX> , it added an entire tank <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">brigade</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">T-72</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tanks</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">BMP</ENAMEX> state-of-the-art infantry fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 300</NUMEX> combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> had arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kandahar</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last few weeks</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> has added <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">FROG-7B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> , the bomber version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">An-12</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">MiG-23BN</ENAMEX> high-altitude <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">MiG-29s</ENAMEX> , which can outfly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Pakistan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F16s</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sukhoi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">SU-27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fighter-bombers</ENAMEX> , which can outfly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">MiG-29s</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> claims this is all needed to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> against the guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> .
     It is well-known that the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">infantry</ENAMEX> is filled with reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conscripts</ENAMEX> .
     But this is not the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> , and it is no longer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> 's only military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     Complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> have been trained and indoctrinated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> have returned .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> has established well-paid paramilitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interior Ministry</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">KHAD\/WAD</ENAMEX> -RRB- , which still is directed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">KGB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> .
     Even if not all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are committed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> , they are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> dependent on it .
     And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have been taken to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , where they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> for the behavior of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> have been assisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> .
     In preparation for the withdrawal , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Delhi</ENAMEX> signed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> agreements for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> newly civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to replace some of the more visible <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> also have been active in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> cut a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> : a future <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> role in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in exchange for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> support of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> policy .
     The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Shi'ite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Keshtmand</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> prime ministry .
     Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> .
     Before his assassination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zia</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Pakistan</ENAMEX> repeatedly stated that fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were being inserted into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill McCollum </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> -RRB- reports that these included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Central Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">KGB Border Guards</ENAMEX> , ethnically indistinguishable from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX> and wearing unmarked uniforms .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> is increasingly successful at portraying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> as bloody-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> .
     In this they are aided by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> support for the most extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">factions</ENAMEX> -- radical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> whose policies are anathema to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> .
     This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">autumn last year</TIMEX> , for example , the regime <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garrison</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kandahar</ENAMEX> was prepared to surrender the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> to resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> .
     At the last minute , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> sent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar</ENAMEX> , perhaps the most hated and feared of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> , with a demand that the surrender be made to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> .
     The deal fell through , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kandahar</ENAMEX> remains a major regime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">base</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> gloves .
     Experienced resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , they were pressured by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Pakistan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">ISI</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">channel</ENAMEX> for their support , into attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jalalabad</ENAMEX> .
     They took more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> casualties ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> report that they faced minefields without mine detectors .
     The wonder is not that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> has failed to topple the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> , but that it continues to exist and fight at all .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer</TIMEX> , in response to congressional criticism , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> said they had resumed military aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">months</TIMEX> after it was cut off ; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> has been defenseless against air attack .
     Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Stingers</ENAMEX> or other anti-aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have indicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">resistance</ENAMEX> achieves by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kabul</ENAMEX> must have found that information useful .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy has been incoherent , based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf .
     No settlement negotiated by others can force the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to give up their struggle .
     A cutoff of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain .
     Creation of a new , realistic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy is long overdue .

     Nothing stirred the soul of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> as much as the crusade to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> , or the dream of building a space-based defense <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">shield</ENAMEX> to knock out <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> .
     Yet under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cherished national-security causes are withering on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> .
     And , surprisingly , little more than a whimper of protest is being heard , even though <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Reaganauts</ENAMEX> once breathed fire supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> and the Strategic Defense Initiative .
     `` The programs have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX> , a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> .
     Yet , he asserts , `` you look around ... and you say , ` Who are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> ?
     Who is going to carry the water ? ' ''
     It is n't surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has n't led a crusade to pump up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> or SDI .
     Though he nominally supports both programs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has n't been a passionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of either cause , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was .
     What 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> lets the programs slip down the national-priority list .
     A combination of factors -- a weariness among some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> , a decline in the perception of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility .
     Above all , though , conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> who have championed both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> and SDI are reluctant to attack a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be receding .
     `` We want to complain , we want to say something about it , and we 're going to as it gets worse , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Burton </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> who has been a staunch <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backer</ENAMEX> .
     `` But it 's like kicking your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in the pants .
     You hate to do it because he 's your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> ' unhappiness with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> will make them more willing to speak out .
     Of course , neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has actually abandoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> or SDI .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has struck a deal with congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to provide nonlethal aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> holds national elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next February</TIMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has dropped any effort to win military aid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> gives several congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> the right to cut off even humanitarian aid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> are likely to let aid continue until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think there 's little prospect the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> can be a significant fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> , and after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> election their future in any form will be murky at best .
     Instead of focusing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has switched to urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> -- most recently in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> continues to support SDI , or Star Wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">just last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> gave a strong speech listing `` compelling reasons '' to push ahead with SDI and saying he 'd urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to veto a defense bill with `` inadequate '' funding for the program .
     But the strong pitch by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> has already voted for a deep cut in funding , and in the end the program 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     And while the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> is speaking out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself has n't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> did .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's original vision of an `` impenetrable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">shield</ENAMEX> '' protecting the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but rather a more modest version .
     More ominous to SDI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> without including restrictions on space-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">defenses</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> does SDI testing or deployment that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> think violates the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">anti-ballistic-missile treaty</ENAMEX> .
     It will be hard down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to approve money for SDI plans if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gaffney </ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> who now heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Center for Security Policy</ENAMEX> , charges that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's `` professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity . ''
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> perceives the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> threat is declining under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , because communism seems to be beating a global retreat , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs .
     `` The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell Daniels</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> who now is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hudson Institute</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> are toiling to raise the profile of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> causes .
     But they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in a position to turn the tide .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of these programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia</ENAMEX> , is distracted by questions about his ethics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> note .
     Other conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Wallop</ENAMEX> , a longtime SDI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> , do n't have the clout with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> that they enjoyed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> .
     Above all , though , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> say neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support .
     `` For there to be wind in the sails of any program , the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> has to be blowing in the sails , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton</ENAMEX> .
     All this causes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX> to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm .
     `` What I 'd like to see , if he is up to it , is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> says .

     We 're sorry to report that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> accepted the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Allen</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Civil Rights Commission</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen </ENAMEX>, appointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> , grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> .
     His recent speech , provocatively titled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> ? <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> ? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homosexuals</ENAMEX> ? What is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minority</ENAMEX> ? '' caused an uproar when its title leaked out .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> voted to call his unread speech `` thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Francis Berry</ENAMEX> said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missile</ENAMEX> who is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> , warned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> 's jurisdiction . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Stoddard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lambda Legal Defense Fund</ENAMEX> , called the prospect of the speech `` frankly shocking . ''
     We 've actually read the speech .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> began it with a warning to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">hosts</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> church <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that opposes rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> .
     He said that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the conference `` do not believe that the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should be guaranteed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> , '' but that `` I mean to persuade you to the opposite view . ''
     He recalled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> a `` strange , infelicitous '' analogy he once heard arguing `` now that we have finally recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> have rights , we need to do the same for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> .
     '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> objected to this analogy because it seems to `` assimilate the status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> -- as a mere project of charity , of humaneness . ''
     Rights on such a basis , whether for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> , are `` mere indulgences , '' he said , subject to being taken back .
     He says the title of his speech was to make his point that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have rights as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> , not as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of certain select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> .
     His speech criticized the `` idiocy of notions of protected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in society '' as opposed to individual equality or , as he put it , in `` a common destiny as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> . ''
     Instead of lobbying for special treatment , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk `` invidious retrenchment with government complicity . ''
     This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed .
     What 's really going on here ?
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> most important things to understand about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> is that he is a black conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX> -- a triple threat to the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen </ENAMEX>, who teaches <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> at prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvey Mudd College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> and will remain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">commission</ENAMEX> , has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> arguing that civil rights are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> ' rights .
     He last made waves when he dared to defend an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who had been adopted by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> off her reservation .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again , which somehow elevated the vague concept of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> rights '' above the rights of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> .
     There is a huge divide between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> 's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , the gap is so large that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> refuse to engage the debate .
     Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument .
     Their effort to run him out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement .
     We hope the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Civil Rights Commission</ENAMEX> will be as brave as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> in making the case for equality of civil rights .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leninskoye Zamya</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">republics</ENAMEX> `` does n't reflect the radical changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">federation</ENAMEX> .

     The eucalyptus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plantation</ENAMEX> and pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mill</ENAMEX> , which would have covered <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">about 175,000 acres</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Irian Jaya</ENAMEX> region , had been approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Indonesia</ENAMEX> 's investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> .
     But it was opposed by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> as a threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Irian Jaya</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> who inhabit them .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid Corp.</ENAMEX> , benefiting from staff-reduction savings , reported a strong gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> operating results and net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 cents</NUMEX> a share , after preferred-stock requirements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the numbers were better than expectations , partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation .
     However , they said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's flat revenue was a disappointment , and an indication that sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid </ENAMEX>'s new conventional film in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> have been sluggish .
     Revenue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 437.7 million</NUMEX> , almost unchanged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 436.3 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     `` I 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> products , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ellmann</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` If you believe that a good performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> is contingent on an acceleration of revenue , there is n't a lot here to base optimism on . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Yanes</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , said `` I do n't know about disappointing , '' but added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise , discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> that it had hoped would be carrying the product already .

     Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile ?
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance : It plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60.25</NUMEX> points before lunch , with most of the drop occurring in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 minutes</TIMEX> .
     Then , it rebounded to finish down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 18.65</NUMEX> points .
     And those swings paled beside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point plunge and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</NUMEX>-point recovery .
     `` It 's madness -- that in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> you can whack off so much value , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanford Calderwood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trinity Investment Management Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> .
     And , apparently , it is here to stay .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bernstein</ENAMEX> , senior quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co </ENAMEX>, says , `` My gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while . ''
     There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness : new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options ; computer-driven strategies like program trading ; and crowd psychology .
     But most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly .
     Prices are moving up and down so fast because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Institutions</ENAMEX> are herding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Anderson</ENAMEX> , who heads the pension-fund management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IDS Financial Services Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` We watch the same indicators and listen to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prognosticators</ENAMEX> .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lemmings</ENAMEX> , we tend to move in the same direction at same time . ''
     And that , naturally , exacerbates price movements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Institutions</ENAMEX> -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink .
     But when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed -- markets jump .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Ward</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scudder , Stevens & Clark</ENAMEX> , found that `` you could n't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up . ''
     And when many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> had to `` pay up , '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's sudden rally was sparked .
     Trading in futures and options , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe , can add to volatility .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks ; that is , a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks .
     These and other modern trading methods `` tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Douglas</ENAMEX> , first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` It 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy '' -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> new investment style called `` asset allocation '' shifts portfolio weightings between stocks , bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Quadrant Corp.</ENAMEX> , an asset <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">allocator</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morristown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , said it quickly boosted stock positions in its `` aggressive '' accounts to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> to take advantage of plunging prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     It added another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> before stocks rallied .
     When they did , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> reduced those stock holdings to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70 %</NUMEX> .
     A classic example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance , now widely discredited .
     Before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 60 billion</NUMEX> in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique .
     The idea was to `` insure '' the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> , when portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets .
     Yet even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets .
     Others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures .
     Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> say Wall Street brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are less willing to make markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers</ENAMEX> do n't deny that .
     Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say that , with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock .
     `` I think everyone 's a little more leery , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Baker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> have driven -LRB- commission -RRB- rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Gallagher </ENAMEX>, senior executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in charge of institutional trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer & Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` Why should I risk money for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> for who 's paying me <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> a dance ?
     All you get is risk . ''
     Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange `` reforms . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say that `` circuit breakers '' put in place to damp volatility after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The circuit breakers caused a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> shutdown in trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling .
     `` With the futures-trading halt , you could only sell stocks '' to cut exposure to the market , says a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> .
     `` It was scary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thinking that they could n't get their trades off . ''
     `` It was like they put you in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and told you there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> doors to exit , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     `` Then they said , ` By the way , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the doors are locked . ' ''
     The takeover mania also adds to volatility .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> is a good example .
     Valued as a buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target</ENAMEX> , the airline stock was trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 280</NUMEX> a share .
     When the deal ran into trouble , the stock tumbled ; it closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 198</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Presumably , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> is now trading closer to its value based on earnings .
     By contrast , traditional buy-and-hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are unlikely to generate sudden price moves .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Black</ENAMEX> , a value-oriented money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delphi Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , points out that for those who invest on fundamentals , `` the value of a stock from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> does n't change all that much . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Stoll</ENAMEX> , finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Vanderbilt University</ENAMEX> , says the current volatility in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> markets pales in comparison to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced .
     `` I just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility , '' he says .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Arnott </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of asset allocator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Quadrant</ENAMEX> , notes that before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's tailspin , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volatility on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> had reached `` historically low levels . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to ignore that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , asserts that `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the least volatile years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last 30 or 40 years</TIMEX> . ''
     But the low average volatility Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Grossman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Wharton School</ENAMEX> finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> , says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> `` who can go out and say ` I have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a billion dollars</NUMEX> of stocks to sell . ' ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think the search for liquidity is fruitless .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1936</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maynard Keynes</ENAMEX> wrote that `` of the maxims of orthodox finance none , surely , is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity . ''
     It leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to focus on short-term price movements -- `` a game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">musical chairs</ENAMEX> , '' he called it -- rather than on long-term fundamental valuation .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">probe</ENAMEX> , which is to be launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Redmond </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> discovered the virus on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> university centers to be infected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">shuttle</ENAMEX> , part of the network will carry analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> data once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">craft</ENAMEX> gets spaceborn .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> feared `` garbage data could be substituted for real data . ''
     He estimated it could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> for a computer security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> to expunge the virus from a computer system .
     The intruder , among the broadest yet to hit a research network , appeared to affect only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> hardware that uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VAX\/VMS</ENAMEX> operating system .
     It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Arpanet</ENAMEX> , a much larger network used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratories</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> around the world .
     In the lingo of computer security , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> intruder is technically a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> apparently was hatched on a computer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> hooked up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Space Physics Analysis Network</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> because they had modified their systems to reject <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> that had n't elected to make the changes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Alexander </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Computerworld</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publication</ENAMEX> , said he was told that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> 's name .
     If it finds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> logs on that says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Worms</ENAMEX> Against Nuclear Killers ... .
     You talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war . ''
     In addition , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimist</ENAMEX> , '' or `` Do n't feed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bats</ENAMEX> tonight . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> .
     The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running .
     If it finds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those passwords , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> said , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> will do such things as change <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> ' passwords to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> estimated that , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> computer centers were affected .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the number grew to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> the number is expected to grow to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> said it will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a week</TIMEX> before it knows exactly how many centers of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage , if any .
     Anti-nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> have protested the launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">probe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Jupiter</ENAMEX> because it uses <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:NUCLEAR">plutonium</ENAMEX> to generate the electricity needed to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">craft</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Activists</ENAMEX> fear that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">shuttle</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> into orbit should explode , or if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> itself crashes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Earth</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times it flies close to the planet , fatal levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:NUCLEAR">plutonium</ENAMEX> would be released into the atmosphere .
     So far <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> has been delayed twice , once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> because of the weather .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASA</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Galileo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> had nothing to do with either delay .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Computerworld</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX> have gone after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SPAN</ENAMEX> before .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chaos Computer Club</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , once managed to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SPAN</ENAMEX> and do such things as change the value of pi , messing up some calculations .

     It is now a commonplace that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> only a civil action at most would have been brought .
     Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> , and not to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> .
     Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hudson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodwin</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers .
     That 's the conventional theory anyway .
     In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur .
     In particular , a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> .
     For example , although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been statutorily defined .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> tried to supply a workable definition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirks</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> decision , which found that liability depended on whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tipper</ENAMEX> had breached his fiduciary duty to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> in order to obtain `` some personal gain '' and whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tippee</ENAMEX> knew or recklessly disregarded this fact .
     Gradually , however , lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> have pushed this definition to its breaking point .
     Consider the facts underlying the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> conviction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chestman</ENAMEX> .
     Prior to a tender offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A&P</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waldbaum Inc.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waldbaum</ENAMEX> 's supermarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> called an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery .
     She called her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> to take her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , who , in turn , persuaded her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , a Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb </ENAMEX>, to run this errand .
     Hearing of this information , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> discussed it with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> then bought for his own account and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> .
     Basically , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> was a fourth-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tippee</ENAMEX> .
     Did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb </ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tipper</ENAMEX> , breach a fiduciary duty -LRB- and , if so , to whom -RRB- ?
     Did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> seek personal gain -LRB- and if so , how -RRB- ?
     Or did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> only hear a market rumor -LRB- which one may lawfully trade upon -RRB- ?
     The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Freeman </ENAMEX>, formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of arbitrage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co .</ENAMEX>
     Essentially , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> had invested heavily in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX> leveraged buy-out , when he was told by another prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard `` Bunny '' Lasker</ENAMEX> , that the deal was in trouble .
     After placing orders to sell , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Siegel</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> , who was advising on the deal , to confirm these rumors .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> who his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was and , on hearing that it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunny Lasker</ENAMEX> , responded : `` Well , your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny</ENAMEX> has a good nose . ''
     The illegal `` tip '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny</ENAMEX> 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market .
     Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced :
     Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain ?
     Did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> have notice of this ?
     Finally , was the information material ?
     Yet , all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue : Who is and who should be making the criminal law here ?
     It is not my contention that either Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> was an innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of prosecutorial overzealousness .
     Arguably , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky .
     But even if they behaved recklessly , reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Courts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislatures</ENAMEX> make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors .
     After-the-fact judicial examination of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> 's conduct has always been the common law 's method .
     When only civil liability is involved , this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization .
     Still , case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc -LRB- and usually sleazy -RRB- examples .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> decides that a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule .
     Thus , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule .
     For example , in focusing on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman </ENAMEX>'s attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse , one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin : What if the rumor had been false ?
     Can a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> call an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false ?
     In the past , not only would reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> have rushed to check out such rumors with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> listed on the major stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> were encouraged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> to respond openly to such inquiries from securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman </ENAMEX>'s plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient .
     In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -RRB- Before it acts , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> typically will hear the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ; and -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -RRB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> .
     Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion -LRB- which explains why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading -RRB- , judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions .
     At least when the stakes are high , uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely .
     The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> attempted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues .
     Yet , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> effectively reversed this decision by enacting a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of `` the intangible right of honest services . ''
     At a stroke , this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches -LRB- and possibly all misrepresentations by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> must thereafter interpret , than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility .
     We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway .
     Predictably , when confronted with morally dubious behavior , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them .
     Over the long run , however , sleazy cases will make bad law .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market rout came smack in the middle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the heaviest month</TIMEX> for CD rollovers , when a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> already have promotions under way .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First National Bank of Boston </ENAMEX>, for example , is offering certain new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depositors</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra quarter</NUMEX> of a percentage point on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-month</TIMEX> CDs .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> , for instance , increased the yield on small-denomination <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> CDs to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</NUMEX> .
     On average , however , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> CDs at major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a tenth</NUMEX> of a percentage point less than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week ago</TIMEX> .
     Average yields on CDs aimed at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> as much as yields on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's auction .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Six-month</TIMEX> CDs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000</NUMEX> and less yielded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 8.02 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Tuesday</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.10 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banxquote</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehl</ENAMEX> noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> are boosted by more frequent compounding .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> have an important decision to make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> .
     At the recent meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> announced its intention to decide by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yearend</TIMEX> the size of the next increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> 's capital base .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> share of the increase probably will not reach the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion</NUMEX> or more implicit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF </ENAMEX>'s request for a doubling of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 billion</NUMEX> capital , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> probably will agree to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX> increase .
     This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">G-7</ENAMEX> exchange-rate intervention , and with its financial commitment to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> and others .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> has several reasons for requesting the increase .
     Its role in the economies of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> has grown steadily since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> .
     The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan , which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least three</NUMEX> other factors have encouraged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> to insist on increased capital .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">World Bank</ENAMEX> 's recent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 billion</NUMEX> capital increase -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 billion</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> -- has left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> feeling less than <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fiddle among international financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> would like to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's request for increased ownership -LRB- currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has supported a larger role for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> in developing-country debt issues , and is an important financial resource for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX>-guided programs in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     While international politics may argue for the capital increase , there is a clear economic case against it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> of the increase argue that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> practices central planning while supporting ineffective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> .
     They question whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> has any role in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , given its original mandate to assist industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> in balance-of-payments emergencies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts .
     They worry that new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> funding of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> will simply end up substituting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt , a bad trade all around .
     They believe microeconomics , which addresses the problems of markets , investment climate and management practices , is the key to developing-country growth , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Keynesian</ENAMEX> focus on trade deficits , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> targets and government debt .
     They point at the numerous developing-country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> that have inflated , taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> programs .
     Decisions on increases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF </ENAMEX>'s capital base traditionally are made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , with subsequent authorization by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     The last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> congressional authorization , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , was a political donnybrook and carried a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> housing program along with it to secure adequate votes .
     The politics of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> may support the stabilizing , quasi-governmental role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions : that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> give assurances that liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns ; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns .
     Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> 's popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an election year</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> decision to refuse the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> its capital increase , or limit it to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> , would bring a major change in international economic policy , and could not be taken lightly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> would fret over the implications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">G-7</ENAMEX> coordination process and the stability of world financial markets .
     Because commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and the developing-country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> believe they will get a piece of any capital increase , a scaled-down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> mission would leave both feeling shortchanged .
     Furthermore , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> rejection of the capital increase -LRB- and transfer of shares to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> -RRB- would give <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing .
     On the other hand , a decision to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX> 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     With the increase , even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> that generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF</ENAMEX>-approved economic plans .
     Upping the ante could slow economic development even further , as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> should take a position prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> deadline .
     The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> do n't support an increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMF </ENAMEX>'s capital , then it is incumbent on them to speak up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> and explain the alternative .

     In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> 's powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Home Box Office</ENAMEX> , cable giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime Networks Inc.</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225 million</NUMEX> .
     The purchase comes after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nearly three years</TIMEX> of on-again off-again talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TCI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> , which has also discussed the sale of an interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> with other cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> is a distant No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Home Box Office</ENAMEX> , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> filed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 billion</NUMEX> antitrust suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> , charging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Television</ENAMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO</ENAMEX> has close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cinemax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> and its sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Movie Channel </ENAMEX>, have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 10 million</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paul Kagan Associates</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Carmel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TCI </ENAMEX>, the investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> puts it in an unusual position ; as the largest cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> , with control of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to 12 million</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 million</NUMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TCI</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TCI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malone</ENAMEX> has long been concerned about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO</ENAMEX> 's dominance of the pay TV business , and has been eager to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> as a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> .
     `` It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malone</ENAMEX> said in a statement .

     Additional cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> could boost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> even further .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TCI</ENAMEX> investment is a big victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Biondi</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston H.

     The fight between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> is particularly acrimonious because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> is the former chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBO </ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of marketing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">service</ENAMEX> .

     The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> should make free , voluntary testing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired immune deficiency syndrome</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hudson Institute</ENAMEX> recommended .
     `` By encouraging massive , routine , voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> : those who carry the virus and those who do not , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> said in a new report .
     The report takes a more alarmed view of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses .
     It warns that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic `` may reduce the rate of growth of the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> , curb productivity gains and slow economic growth . ''
     It contends that current government policy is failing to stem the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic because it suggests the use of condoms can make sex `` safe . ''
     But the report says : `` The only safe sex is sex between uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> , '' and testing is the only way to learn of infection .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> estimated that it would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 650 million</NUMEX> a year to test the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">between the ages of 12 and 65 years old</TIMEX> .
     In addition , the report recommends that federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> provide free treatment to all who test positive .

     An unexpectedly sharp widening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade gap for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> dragged the dollar lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , but profit-taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts .
     While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> 's lows .
     Soon after the release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade figures , the dollar plunged to an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">intraday</TIMEX> low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">140.95 yen</NUMEX> .
     It also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8435 marks</NUMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> later .
     The unit stabilized about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> time at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.85 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141 yen</NUMEX> , prompting unconfirmed rumors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> had intervened to blunt the unit 's tumble .
     The dollar finished at its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">intraday</TIMEX> highs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> noted that the foreign exchange market 's initial bearish reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade figures was tempered later by a `` calmer reassessment of the data . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.77 billion</NUMEX> deficit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , compared with a revised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> deficit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.24 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> had expected a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.1 billion</NUMEX> gap .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> figure reflected a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.4 %</NUMEX> rise in imports and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> drop in exports .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc M. Goloven</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade performance , there 's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars .
     He said that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade gap with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> has widened significantly , the trade deficit with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> continues to narrow .
     And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising .
     The dollar 's near-term path remains foggy , according to currencny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , who characterize the market as `` bewildering . ''
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8667 marks</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8685 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.75 yen</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.85 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Monday</TIMEX> .
     Sterling was unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5753</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.55 yen</NUMEX> , unchanged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close .
     Later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 142.25 yen</NUMEX> on news reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> of aggressive dollar sales by the world central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> -- some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> estimate that the barrage of sales topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion</NUMEX> -- and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     They note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Group of Seven</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">partners</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">G-7</ENAMEX> comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     The so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre accord</ENAMEX> was seen to have set ranges of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.70 marks to 1.90 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">120 yen to 140 yen</NUMEX> .
     They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> banking system has been modest , and they do n't anticipate significant easing by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> arranged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> of customer repurchase agreements <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> repurchase agreement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> .
     The move , which injects capital into the system , is seen as an effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> is ready to provide the ample liquidity .
     But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> contend that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's move to loosen credit has n't been aggressive , it nevertheless sends a clear signal that , at least for now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has relaxed its grip on credit .
     They add that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 5\/8 %</NUMEX> from its levels of just below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     The federal funds rate is the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> lending rate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> said that the mark continues to post the most significant gains against the dollar .
