     They want late-<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">shuttles</ENAMEX> to the biology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">labs</ENAMEX> .
     They want a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">library</ENAMEX> .
     And like college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> everywhere , they are talking about a demonstration -- where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> would gather quietly near the science <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> and raise their hands , classroom style .
     Such is the fiber of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">wool</ENAMEX> that woolly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> let fly at gatherings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard University</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Society of Nerds and Geeks</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">SONG</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">SONGsters</ENAMEX> are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they are n't going to take it anymore , at least not without trying a few really neat ideas <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> .
     `` We could have called ourselves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Academic Intellectual Society</ENAMEX> , but then everyone would have said , ` Oh , you mean the nerd-and-geek <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">club</ENAMEX> , ' '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonid Fridman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">SONG</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate-student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , told <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">club</ENAMEX> 's inaugural meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> .
     Membership has since swelled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 20 and 25</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nerds</ENAMEX> as calculator-toting , socially awkward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with shirt-pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Geeks</ENAMEX> , by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> definition , are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chicken</ENAMEX>-mutilating circus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">SONG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Kahn</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior</ENAMEX> , thinks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nerds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geeks</ENAMEX> more as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonconformists</ENAMEX> , '' albeit with a studious bent .
     One of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> projects is a `` procrastination hot line '' that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> could call when they have an urge to delay studying .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">club</ENAMEX> plans to show nerdy movies , such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Real Genius</ENAMEX> , '' in which physics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whizzes</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> with lasers ; and naturally , the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Revenge of the Nerds</ENAMEX> , '' a tale of college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with runny noses and ill-fitting pants .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of its `` more ambitious goals '' is to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaime Escalante</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> high-school mathematics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> featured in the film `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Stand and Deliver</ENAMEX> , '' to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> for a guest lecture .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nerds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geeks</ENAMEX> sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> .
     So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> says high priority is being given to creating a computerized matchmaking service `` where instead of being matched for eye color , you could be matched for similar intellectual interests . ''
     For instance ?
     `` I 'm a math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">major</ENAMEX> , but I want to know about psychobiology .
     Hopefully , I 'd find someone in psychobiology who wanted to know more about mathematics . ''
     It could work .

     Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">concerns</ENAMEX> are beginning to have as much influence in oil-industry spending plans as the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> does .
     In the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Exxon Valdez spill</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , moves toward tighter air-quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> that do n't pollute as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> refined from `` heavy '' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes</ENAMEX> , generally high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">sulfur</ENAMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> , the world 's stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> has been growing heavier .
     So the scramble is on for lighter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes</ENAMEX> globally , and for natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Recently <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela</ENAMEX> , traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">heavy-crude</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">producers</ENAMEX> , have boasted of new finds of light , low-sulfur <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> by their national oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Venezuela</ENAMEX> has also earmarked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> in new money for light-crude exploration .
     And some oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are trying to lock in future supplies .
     Typical is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's state-owned energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> , which not long ago acquired through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">AGIP</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subsidiary</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">consortium</ENAMEX> accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nigeria</ENAMEX> 's oil output .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">AGIP</ENAMEX> already has an oil stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Libya</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> produce high-quality , low-sulfur <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crudes</ENAMEX> especially suited to making high-octane motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> at minimum refining cost .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco Reviglio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">ENI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry -- he calls it a `` revolution '' requiring huge investments -- as a result of environmental issues .
     He made a special trip to examine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> environmental trends because they are often followed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">ENI</ENAMEX> needs to know what 's coming as it prepares to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> on upgrading its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries</ENAMEX> , he says .
     Oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> world-wide will have `` to spend a lot of money for the cleaner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> that will be required , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Lichtblau</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Petroleum Industry Research Foundation</ENAMEX> .
     It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , the search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</ENAMEX> alone is thought to hide <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">more than three billion barrels</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> .
     Until the tanker spill , Big Oil was slowly convincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> it could safely produce from such places .
     Now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry , possibly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     Similarly , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> has been unable to pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> found off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> coast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> .
     A huge production system built in the sea off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> and ashore is sitting idle .
     But the push for cleaner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuels</ENAMEX> is increasing the attractiveness of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> the domestic drilling now under way is for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> , partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> that is cleaner to burn than either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">coal</ENAMEX> .
     Activity has revived in the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> gas-producing regions , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe International Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Kuwait</ENAMEX> -LRB- and is n't related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> -RRB- , is stepping up development of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Matagorda Island</ENAMEX> where it found <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     `` We could have sat on it longer , but the impetus is to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> to the marketplace , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Poole</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe International</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're trying to get it on line as soon as possible now . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> announced plans for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">400-day</TIMEX> project drilling for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about five miles</NUMEX> underground in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Anadarko Basin</ENAMEX> of western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> -- the deepest drilling project in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .

<DOCNO> WSJ0756 </DOCNO>
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> grapples with its worsening economy , leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> much closer to a free-market system .
     The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's restructuring of the economy .
     They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices , breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> out of business .
     They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation , and recommend ways to soften the social consequences .
     While many solutions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's economic troubles are being discussed , the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high-level authorship .
     Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> say the article was written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonid Abalkin</ENAMEX> and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abalkin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Academy of Science 's Institute of Economics</ENAMEX> , was recently appointed deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> on economic reform .
     `` It 's clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     The economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current policies .
     For example , the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and later dropped .
     But the proposals also display political savvy , couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">conservatives</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> who stand to lose out if they are implemented .
     Seeking a middle path between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of change and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> who demand <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> solutions , the article <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> what it calls a `` radical-moderate approach . ''
     The document is to be discussed at a conference of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , and will probably be presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> for consideration <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policy-makers</ENAMEX> draw up proposals for the next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> plan , which starts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , the blueprint represents a powerful <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that `` quick and easy paths to success simply do n't exist . ''
     Instead , they map out a strategy in several phases from now until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> .
     Most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two to three years</TIMEX> at the earliest .
     The key steps advocated include : -- PROPERTY .
     Rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned .
     The document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">enterprises</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">farms</ENAMEX> and allowing a big private sector to flourish , helped by tough anti-monopoly legislation .
     The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between now and 1992</TIMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> leased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> or owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> and joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> .
     Some forms of private property would be sanctioned .
     Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministries</ENAMEX> , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">obstacles</ENAMEX> blocking economic reform .
     -- FINANCES .
     Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's financial crisis , notably its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> budget deficit .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next year</TIMEX> , all loss-making state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">enterprises</ENAMEX> would be put out of business or handed over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who would buy or lease them or turn them into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">cooperatives</ENAMEX> .
     Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1991</TIMEX> .
     A unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly .
     To mop up some of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 billion rubles</NUMEX> in circulation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> should encourage home ownership , including issuing bonds that guarantee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> the right to purchase an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> .
     -- LABOR .
     A genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid , centralized system .
     Departing from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> dogma , the new system would lead to big differences in pay between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and almost certainly to unemployment .
     To cushion the blows , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits .
     -- PRICES .
     The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled , and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> would still be able to buy some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> and household goods at subsidized prices , but luxury and imported items , including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , would be sold at market prices .
     Wholesale prices would be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories : raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels ; government-set procurement prices for a small number of key products ; and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> .
     Inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> do n't suffer unduly .
     -- FOREIGN TRADE .
     The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreigners</ENAMEX> would receive greater incentives to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX>
     Alongside the current non-convertible ruble , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other Western currencies .
     A domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's banking system .
     The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> powerful economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">institutions</ENAMEX> that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans : the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Planning Committee</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Gosplan</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Committee for Material Supply</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Gossnab</ENAMEX> .
     But it hints strongly that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">organizations</ENAMEX> would increasingly lose their clout as the changes , particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies , take effect .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Engelken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Thomson</ENAMEX> had never met , though for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">38 years</TIMEX> their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , now a transit-association <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> , a paper-products <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Montvale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , had n't even talked to each other .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one recent day</TIMEX> , they became much closer .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , a rabid baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> , pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of `` my favorite and not-so-favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> . ''
     He often groans , he says , at the `` clutter '' of sports stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">alcohol</ENAMEX> , gambling and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> 's lament `` about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the miserly millions</NUMEX> he is offered to play the game . ''
     His <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , even carries a sports column called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Jurisprudence</ENAMEX> '' that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> .
     Like many sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> has turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cynic</ENAMEX> .
     But his is a story about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> in an era of sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-heroes</ENAMEX> , and about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Ruth</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> reminds us , once called `` the only real game in the world . ''
     To Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , it is also a story `` about love , because I 'm blessed to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> who still thinks her slightly eccentric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</NUMEX> birthday deserves the ultimate present . ''
     To understand what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> means , one must go back to a sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1951</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Polo Grounds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> , where , it can be argued , the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out .
     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> inning of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> game of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-game playoff between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Brooklyn Dodgers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York Giants</ENAMEX> -LRB- the predecessor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> scheduled to play in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">world series</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> had sweated out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a long summer</TIMEX> with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> , and now it had come to this : a battle between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National League</ENAMEX> pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game , no less .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 34,320</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> jammed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands</ENAMEX> , and shouted at the top of their lungs .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> was doing the same across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Hudson River</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , where , with his nose pressed against the front window of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Passaic-Clifton National Bank</ENAMEX> , he watched the duel on a television set the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> set up for the event .
     The playoff series had riveted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">12-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> struck <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , winning the opener , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-run homer off <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Dodger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-hander</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recalls with precision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> got swamped in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> game , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> , and trailed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> going into the bottom of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and deciding game .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> scored once and had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitey Lockman</ENAMEX> -RCB- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint Hartung</ENAMEX> -RCB- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> advanced to the plate . ''
     The rest , as they say , is history .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> , a tall , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX>-born , right-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> , stepped into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX> 's box .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> took a called strike , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recounts .
     The tension mounted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> , again on the mound , stared down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX> .
     He wound up and let loose a fastball .
     The pitch sailed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> high and inside and then , with a crack of the bat , was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stands</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> went into euphoria , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> was made a legend .
     The same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> , it turns out , who sells those paper-goods <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     There ca n't be an older baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> alive who does n't clearly remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> homer , who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Hodges</ENAMEX> radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> shouting , over and over , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> win the pennant , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> win the pennant ! ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> drifted in different directions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the subsequent years</TIMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Polo Grounds</ENAMEX> , located under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Coogan 's Bluff</ENAMEX> in upper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , was replaced by a public-housing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">project</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> played outfield and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> base until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> , posting a lifetime <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.270</NUMEX> batting average and chalking up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX> home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> moved south to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1951</TIMEX> .
     When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> , came down the aisle on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">their wedding day in 1966</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment : `` You look prettier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> 's home run . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Homer</ENAMEX> , was named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Event</ENAMEX> , though unwitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> assumed he was the namesake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> .
     And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> , who was born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> before the home run , reached her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25th</NUMEX> birthday , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote his sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> to tell him of the coincidence of events .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> sent off a card to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> : `` It does n't seem like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">25 years</TIMEX> since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth , '' it read .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> was pleased , but nowhere near as much as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
     The family license plate reads `` <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:OTHER">ENG 23</ENAMEX> , '' the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> 's uniform number .
     And on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40th</NUMEX> birthday , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> to be autographed .
     `` What could have been better ? '' asks Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Engelken</ENAMEX> asked the same question <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was about to turn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">50</TIMEX> .
     She had an idea .
     On her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</NUMEX> birthday -LRB- after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">an auspicious 23 years</TIMEX> of marriage , it should be noted -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> and their college-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> set out for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Fordham University</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> had scheduled a stop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">New Jersey Turnpike</ENAMEX> to , she told her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , pick up some papers for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> .
     The papers would be handed over at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">bank</ENAMEX> of telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">booths</ENAMEX> just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Exit 10</ENAMEX> .
     `` It sounded like something out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Fleming</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recalls .
     At the appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">exit</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> pulled over , and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> went to get her papers .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> turned off the motor and rolled down the window .
     In a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> , she was back , with a tall , silver-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in tow .
     She crouched down by the car window and addressed her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> with her favorite nickname :
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertie</ENAMEX> , '' she said , `` Happy <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</NUMEX> Birthday .
     This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` And there he was , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of my youth , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in history I 'd most like to meet .

''
     They talked of the home run .
     `` I thought it was in the upper deck , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> , now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">66 years old</TIMEX> .
     They talked of the aftermath .
     `` I never thought it would become so momentous , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX> remarked .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , `` was overwhelmed by the whole thing .
     It was worth it , just for the look on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert</ENAMEX> 's face . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Exit 10</ENAMEX> , rehashing the event , `` fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> now turned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">50</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> says .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> `` a very fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> . ''
     And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> replied : `` You know , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert</ENAMEX> , if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy , you have an obligation to do it . ''
     In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> , who is married and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , says he has few ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> , other than playing old-timers games now and again .
     But his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , to his constant amazement , never let him forget the famous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-bagger .
     His mail regularly recalls `` my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> event , '' and has been growing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     In response to the letters , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note , and rarely arranges a rendezvous .
     But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote him , saying she could stop near his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , it seemed different .
     `` What a good feeling it would be for me to do that , '' he says he thought .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> got back from its trip up north , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote it all down , just to make sure no detail was missed .
     `` On the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , '' his notes recall , `` it took concentrated effort to keep that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> pointed south .
     My mind was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">miles</NUMEX> north at a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Coogan 's Bluff</ENAMEX> , where a real sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> had captured the imagination of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it .
     `` Take heart , sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , '' he wrote .
     `` Real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> exist .
     You might not find one in the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Jurisprudence</ENAMEX> ' column .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.J.

     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , it had more than doubled .
     Now the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">33-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> earns a modest salary as an assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of economics , is saving harder than ever .
     `` I am determined to get an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> , '' she says .
     `` It 's all I think about or talk about . ''
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of other young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Koreans</ENAMEX> , the long-cherished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , it has become a highly volatile political issue .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last May</TIMEX> , a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> released a report on the extent and causes of the problem .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 15 years</TIMEX> , the report showed , housing prices increased nearly fivefold .
     The report laid the blame on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> , who it said had pushed land prices up ninefold .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> found that since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , real-estate prices rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50 %</NUMEX> in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity , the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">1988 Seoul Olympics</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's pledge to rapidly develop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> 's southwest .
     The result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially .
     For those with no holdings , the prospects of buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> are ever slimmer .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> owned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">71,895 square kilometers</NUMEX> of private land , the report said , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> owned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of the land devoted to housing .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Land Bureau</ENAMEX> reports that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> own their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> .
     Rents have soared along with house prices .
     Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">National Assemblyman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Sa-Duk</ENAMEX> , now a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> , says the problem is intolerable for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'm afraid of a popular revolt if this situation is n't corrected , '' he adds .
     In fact , during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past three months</TIMEX> there have been several demonstrations at the office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Land Bureau</ENAMEX> is housed , and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Assembly</ENAMEX> , demanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> put a stop to real-estate speculation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Tae Woo</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has been studying the real-estate crisis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past year</TIMEX> with an eye to partial land redistribution .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bills to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Assembly</ENAMEX> .
     The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system .
     Highlights of the bills , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> can own , to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">660 square meters</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> , but more in smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> and rural areas .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will penalize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> , but wo n't confiscate property .
     -- A tax of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 3 % and 6 %</NUMEX> on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling .
     -- Taxes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 15 % and 50 %</NUMEX> a year on `` excessive '' profits from the resale of property , or the sale of idle land to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar-sized properties in an area .
     -- Grace periods ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two to five years</TIMEX> before the full scope of the penalties takes effect .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> .
     But opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> and others calling for help for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">renters</ENAMEX> say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> .
     Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and lots .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice</ENAMEX> , a public-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based .
     But others , large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> , real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's proposals are intolerable .
     Led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Federation of Korean Industries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are lobbying for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties .
     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who are urging real-estate reforms balk at the arguments of business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and chafe at their pressure .
     `` There is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kyu Hwang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Land Bureau</ENAMEX> , which drafted the bills .
     But , he adds , the constitution empowers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to impose some controls , to mitigate the shortage of land .
     The land available for housing construction stands at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">about 46.2 square meters</NUMEX> a person -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> lower than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</NUMEX> that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10,000</NUMEX> property <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">speculators</ENAMEX> are operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> .
     The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">culprits</ENAMEX> , he says , are big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> that buy huge amounts of land `` not for their corporate use , but for resale at huge profit . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> calculated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 67 %</NUMEX> of corporate-owned land is held by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">403</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- and that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 1.5 %</NUMEX> of that is used for business .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Bank Supervision and Examination</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Assembly</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of 1989</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> largest business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> bought real estate valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> , as a result , has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> .
     Under those measures , financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> , investment and credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of their capital -- currently the proportion is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> .
     The maximum allowable property holdings for insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of their total asset value , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> currently .
     But Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation , apartment prices are unlikely to go down .
     At best , she realizes , they will rise more slowly -- more slowly , she hopes , than her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's income .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> suburb 's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">outlets</ENAMEX> .
     Distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">centers</ENAMEX> are bombed , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> are intimidated .
     Censorship is imposed by terrorism .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">mafia</ENAMEX> 's terrorism someday will extend to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> published in the free world .
     The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> also woke up too late to the menace <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> posed to the moral structure of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Even now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat .
     I can attest that a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was offered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in the few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">blocks</ENAMEX> ' walk between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Grand Central Terminal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Waldorf Astoria Hotel</ENAMEX> in midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> alone -- its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> -- does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully .
     All drug-consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> must jointly decide to combat and punish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , as the major drug <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">consumer</ENAMEX> , should lead this joint effort .
     Reduction , if not the total cessation , of drug consumption is the requirement for victory .
     Much is being done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> to fight the drug cartel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">mafia</ENAMEX> .
     Luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ranches</ENAMEX> have been raided by the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> , and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopters</ENAMEX> have been impounded at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> , and a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> and launches has been confiscated .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">explosives</ENAMEX> and other war-like materiel .
     Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> -- but , on the other hand , none of the key drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX> have been captured .
     There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money .
     In my opinion , this is not true .
     Laundered drug money has served only to increase , unrealistically , the price of real estate , creating serious problems for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who aspire to own their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> .
     Drug money has also gone to buy expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">airplanes</ENAMEX> , launches and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">nightclubs</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> are consumed .
     But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , the cooperation of those financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> is essential to the success of the drug battle .
     What is of much more importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> 's legitimate products .
     The price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> has gone down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 45 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> , to the lowest level -LRB- after inflation -RRB- since the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Depression</ENAMEX> .
     Market conditions point to even lower prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">27-year-old</TIMEX> coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">cartel</ENAMEX> had to be formally dissolved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Colombia</ENAMEX> will earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> less from its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> than last .
     Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> face reductions in their income , and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> export -- cut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> -- into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> market .
     A just price and an open market for what <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> produces and exports should be the policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> to make a plea to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> , to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> dedicated to the fight against the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     Each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">gram</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cocaine</ENAMEX> consumed is a deadly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">bullet</ENAMEX> against those in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge .
     A crusade of NO to the consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> is imperative .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cano</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">El Espectador</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> founded by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> .

     It has more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thirty-four thousand</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> live in foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> , while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> have no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> at all .
     Its tax base is shrinking , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> budget deficit looms , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> faces contract negotiations with all major municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     This is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> .
     When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> most likely to gain custody of all this is a career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> .
     Running the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest and most ornery <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> may be no treat , but at least Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> knows what to expect from it .
     As the campaign hits the home stretch , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> still have very little idea what they can expect from him .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">25 years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> politics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> remains an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX> .
     The soft-spoken , silver-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> -- the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> nomination for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> here -- does n't have a single prominent political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> .
     While he is widely described as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with deep convictions , he has few major political programs that he can call his own .
     Asked about his greatest achievement in public life , he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> speaks about the quality of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> .
     Now , as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">election day</TIMEX> nears , even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 7</TIMEX> .
     They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cronies</ENAMEX> who may seek a place at the trough .
     They wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> through a possible fiscal crisis , and they wonder who will be advising him .
     Will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> , who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , or will he tilt toward the real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">interests</ENAMEX> that have funneled money into his campaign ?
     After his decisive primary victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward I. Koch</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> coasted , until recently , on a quite-comfortable lead over his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> , the former crime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buster</ENAMEX> who has proved a something of a bust as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has stumbled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two weeks</TIMEX> over his campaign 's payments to a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> who is a convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kidnapper</ENAMEX> , and over his handling of a stock sale to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> .
     Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's support among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> , and citywide projections now put his lead at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four and 20</NUMEX> percentage points .
     In an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think I will give away the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">store</ENAMEX> , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says .
     `` I am aware we have real budgetary problems . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> is full of aging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> , water mains and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadways</ENAMEX> that are in need of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> worth of repair .
     Renewed efforts to fight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and crime will be costly .
     But city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say tax revenues are lagging .
     And after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> of explosive job growth on Wall Street , a period of contraction is under way .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> already has announced he will drop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,200</NUMEX> jobs from the city payroll , but that wo n't be enough .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Regan</ENAMEX> predicts a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> budget gap for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX> , a gap that could grow if there is a recession .
     If elected , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods .
     `` He is going to face a mess , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Stein</ENAMEX> .
     `` His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> are not venal , but their solution to everything will be to spend more money , and he wo n't have any money . ''
     By and large , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has finessed the touchy question of whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox</ENAMEX> he would gore .
     Instead of focusing on the financial future , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has sold himself as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unifier</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 years</TIMEX> of commotion generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> .
     `` The thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer Frucher</ENAMEX> , a real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> .
     `` It is a feel-good candidacy . ''
     No doubt , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has been a calming influence .
     He is an avuncular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> who remembers the birthdays of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , opens doors for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody .
     More important , he emerged as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peacemaker</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Central Park</ENAMEX> rape of a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jogger</ENAMEX> -- in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> was charged -- and the racial murder of a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX> in the white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> .
     Rather than scaring off white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> , as many predicted he would , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> attracted many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head .
     -LRB- Keeping cool is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> priority : On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">humid days this summer</TIMEX> , he was known to change his double-breasted suits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as four</NUMEX> times a day . -RRB-
     But even in his front-runner campaign , he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> -- and might hinder him as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last few weeks</TIMEX> , he has frittered away <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</NUMEX> of what was once a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>-point lead in the polls over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> .
     A story about how he mishandled the sale to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of his stock in a media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> controlled by his political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy Sutton</ENAMEX> was allowed to fester <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a full week</TIMEX> before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> faced the media .
     He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke .
     His campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations it paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 10,000</NUMEX> for what it said was a `` get-out-the-vote '' effort by black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny Carson</ENAMEX> , a convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kidnapper</ENAMEX> who later said publicly that he is `` anti-white . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> have said the payment looked like an attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> camp to get Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> murder -- protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> to turn from a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> also has failed to allay <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> ' fears about his association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> , despite the fact that few local non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> have been as vocal for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> causes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 20 years</TIMEX> as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has .
     These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has run into before .
     A former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">U.S. Marine</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">club</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> , linking up with black urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Rangel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Paterson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> , and getting himself elected to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">assembly</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1965</TIMEX> .
     But his chance to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy mayor</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham Beame</ENAMEX> , a plan boosted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> , was squandered because of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> running .
     `` I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , '' he said at the time .
     Later , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> became more deeply indebted to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> and other city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> , including then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul O'Dwyer</ENAMEX> , when they helped him get appointed city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> , a largely ceremonial post responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's marriage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> , among other things .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Dwyer</ENAMEX> is now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> 's media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     The debt rose further in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> resigned his position as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> recalls : `` When I left , I sat down with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie -LCB- Rangel -RCB-</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil -LCB- Paterson -RCB-</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> said , ` Who will run for borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> ? ' And I said , ` You will . ' ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Garth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> 's longtime media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , says of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , `` He really is the personification of the patronage system .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is so personally decent , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to forget that . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     But by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best known among city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> for his problems making up his mind on matters before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Estimate</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">body</ENAMEX> that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colleagues</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning hours</TIMEX> as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> would march his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> out of board meetings and into his private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
     `` He taught me how to drink herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tea</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 a.m.</TIMEX> , I 'll give him that , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Esnard</ENAMEX> .
     Often , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> claim .
     On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Estimate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> to vote against a controversial real-estate project at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Columbus Circle</ENAMEX> .
     But board <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to his position .
     Says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> : `` Everybody else had brought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">wagons</ENAMEX> and made their deal .
     He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Bronx Borough</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Ferrer</ENAMEX> , was said to be so impatient with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign .
     `` I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferrer</ENAMEX> admits , but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> and that he backs the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> enthusiastically .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lynch</ENAMEX> , denies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has taken too long to decide important issues .
     `` We did n't rubber-stamp everything that came to us , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> says .
     On some occasions when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has discussed the issues during the campaign , he has run into a familiar kind of trouble .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> were stunned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> suggested weakening the law forbidding public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to go on strike .
     He withdrew the remark .
     When he later sided with striking hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> cringed a little more , concerned that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     Then , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> before receiving an endorsement from environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> promised he would issue a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> moratorium on construction of garbage-incinerator <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     That announcement was roundly criticized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> -- who has endorsed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> -- because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> faces a garbage crisis and has already spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> planning for an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">incinerator</ENAMEX> that would be scrapped under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's proposal .
     While his public statements have at times been confusing , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment .
     He favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to their record of hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     With an untrained local labor pool , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> believe , that policy could drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> in the battle over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> thinking of moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> .
     Many economic-development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's aggressive approach helped save <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> jobs from moving across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Hudson</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's economic planks do n't seem to bother the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> , where he draws significant support .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spinola</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Real Estate Board of New York</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's inner circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> appears to include both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ideologues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pragmatists</ENAMEX> , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> with little clue as to who will be more influential .
     The key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> seems to be the campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> .
     A disheveled , roly-poly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Long Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">potato</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> is a veteran union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizer</ENAMEX> who worked on the presidential campaigns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> .
     But as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> campaign hit tough times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Cuomo</ENAMEX> , the politically seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> , is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy .
     Another close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Messinger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">councilwoman</ENAMEX> , some of whose programs , such as commercial rent control , have made their way into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's position papers .
     If she remains influential with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , as some suggest she will , his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Leventhal</ENAMEX> , who would head a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> transition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , is more mainstream , as is real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Gliedman</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> also has said he would receive economic advice from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> that would include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Robinson III</ENAMEX> , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Rohatyn</ENAMEX> , leveraged-buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reginald Lewis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Flom</ENAMEX> .
     Some business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and others also believe that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> would place significant responsibility in the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy mayor</ENAMEX> with a strong administrative background .
     Names of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> that have surfaced include former mayoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ravitch</ENAMEX> , former schools <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Macchiarola</ENAMEX> and Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leventhal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gliedman</ENAMEX> .
     Then there are Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's old-time <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rangel</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paterson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> .
     Having attained positions of real influence or wealth , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> constitute the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Guard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> black politics ; they are less confrontational than the younger , more activist black political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that has been based largely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Part of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     `` We know there are potholes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> out there , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paterson</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's former law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> .
     `` If any of us think we 're going to sidetrack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> 's determination to be the best possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake . ''
     Adds Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messinger</ENAMEX> , who is expected to win the borough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's job Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is vacating , `` You have to remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pragmatist</ENAMEX> . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> 's determination not to upset the political apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cart</ENAMEX> .
     He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's school system .
     `` I will sit down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ? Uh-uh , '' he says with a shake of the head .
     Despite many doubts about his candidacy , white <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> -- who gave Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of their votes in the primary -- are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> .
     The former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , who prosecuted targets ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Mafia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dons</ENAMEX> to Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , has succeeded in raising questions about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> 's ethical standards , but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy .
     As a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> in an overwhelmingly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> has an inherent handicap .
     As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> , he has been slow to learn the nuances of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> politicking .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> is finding that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> , in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> in public life , has built up considerable good will that so far has led many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> to overlook certain failings .
     `` The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Hoenlein</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     `` In the end , I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> will be judged for being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> .

     A side porch was ripped away .
     The chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn .

     She has been on the move almost incessantly since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Thursday</TIMEX> , when an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> , employed by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policyholders</ENAMEX> sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives .
     Equipped with cellular telephones , laptop computers , calculators and a pack of blank checks , they parcel out money so their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> can find temporary living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">quarters</ENAMEX> , buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , replace lost clothing , repair broken water heaters , and replaster walls .
     Some of the funds will used to demolish unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> and clear sites for future construction .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> are authorized to write checks for amounts <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 100,000</NUMEX> on the spot .

     She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls .
     While she works inside , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX> returns with several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to collect furniture and clothing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">kitchen</ENAMEX> .
     Others grab books , records , photo albums , sofas and chairs , working frantically in the fear that an aftershock will jolt the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> again .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margie Hammack</ENAMEX> , are luckier than many others .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> , had deployed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 750</NUMEX> of them in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charleston</ENAMEX> .

     It could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six to nine months</TIMEX> to handle the earthquake-related claims .
     When the earthquake rocked northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> senior claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area were at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes , including earthquakes .
     Since commercial airline flights were disrupted , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> chartered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> to fly these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> and bring along portable computers , cellular phones and some claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Offices</ENAMEX> were set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose</ENAMEX> .
     In a few instances , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> knew it would probably be shelling out big bucks , even before a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> called or faxed in a claim .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Walnut Creek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> learned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Amfac Hotel</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> , which is insured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> , was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news .
     `` The secret to being a good adjuster is counting , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerardo Rodriguez</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjuster</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Ana</ENAMEX> .
     `` You have to count everything . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adjusters</ENAMEX> must count the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">bathrooms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">balconies</ENAMEX> , fireplaces , chimneys , microwaves and dishwashers .
     But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors , wallcoverings , roofing and siding , to come up with a total value for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> .
     To do that , they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot , carpeting by the square yard , wallpaper by the roll , molding by the linear foot .
     Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting , plumbing and roofing in each major region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> can figure out the value of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it .
     Sometimes repairs are out of the question .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjuster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Schaeffer</ENAMEX> visited a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Thursday</TIMEX> , he found them living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">mobile home</ENAMEX> parked in front of their yard .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> itself , located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about 50 yards</NUMEX> from the collapsed section of double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate 880</ENAMEX> , was pushed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about four feet</NUMEX> off its foundation and then collapsed into its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">basement</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next day</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schaeffer</ENAMEX> presented the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> with a check for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 151,000</NUMEX> to help them build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> in the same neighborhood .
     He also is working with a real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> to help find them an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> to rent while their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> is being built .
     Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> have some experience with construction work or carpentry .
     But such skills were alien to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni Johnson</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Four years ago</TIMEX> , she was managing a film-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> and was totally bored .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> mentioned that she might want to look into a position at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> , if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her .
     She signed up , starting as an `` inside '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjuster</ENAMEX> , who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year later</TIMEX> , she moved to the commercial property claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     She spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a month</TIMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Gettysburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , learning all about the construction trade , including masonry , plumbing and electrical wiring .
     That was followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Aetna Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford</ENAMEX> , where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies .
     Her new line of work has some perils .
     Recently , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> saved her from falling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> torched by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arsonist</ENAMEX> .
     `` I owe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> .
     I really do , '' she says .
     As Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> stands outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> after winding up her chores there , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> begins to creak and sway .
     The ground shakes underneath her .
     It is an aftershock , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> since the earthquake , and it makes her uneasy .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next day</TIMEX> , as she prepares a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> check for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammacks</ENAMEX> , which will cover the cost of demolishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> and clearing away the debris , she jumps at the slightest noise .
     On further reflection , she admits that venturing inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammacks</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous day</TIMEX> was n't `` such a great idea . ''
     During her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammacks</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> reviews exactly what their policy covers .
     They would like to retrieve some appliances on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor , but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> tells them that , if the appliances ca n't be salvaged , their policy covers the replacement cost .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammack</ENAMEX> is eager to know what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> will pay for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , which has to come down .
     `` When will I get that check for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million dollars</NUMEX> ? '' he jokes .
     The adjuster had n't completed all the calculations , but says : `` We 're talking policy limits . ''
     In this case , that 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 250,000</NUMEX> .
     It suddenly dawns on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammack</ENAMEX> that rebuilding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Gatos</ENAMEX> , an affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Santa Clara County</ENAMEX> , may cost more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> 's policy will pay .
     `` We can lose money on this , '' he says .
     `` And you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammack</ENAMEX> , reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand .
     Earthquake insurance costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 to $ 4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> of value , and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe .
     So , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> believe they can get by without it .
     Even Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> herself made that assumption .
     `` I always knew that the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Big One</ENAMEX> ' was coming , but not during my lifetime , '' she says .
     Now she says she 's thinking of contacting her own insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> .
     For Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> , dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience .
     She lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Oakland</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> hit hard by the earthquake .
     She did n't have hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five days</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> she shares with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">12-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> was rattled , books and crystal hit the floor , but nothing was severely damaged .
     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX> , wishes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni</ENAMEX> had a different job .
     `` We worry about her out there , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX> says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Sunday</TIMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> finally got a chance to water her <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> , but stopped abruptly .
     `` I realized I could n't waste this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> when there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Watsonville</ENAMEX> who do n't have fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> to drink . ''
     She has n't played any music since the earthquake hit , out of respect for those who died on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate 880</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadway</ENAMEX> collapsed .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> to continue offering discount phone services for large-business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> moves were good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Sikes</ENAMEX> , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , championed deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> at his last job as head of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     But it has been an open question whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> , an extraordinarily cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , would continue pushing deregulation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure .
     `` It means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> is serious about the deregulation of long distance , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman</ENAMEX> , a telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , who attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> meeting .
     `` All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> were in amazing agreement -LCB- to re-examine regulation -RCB- for only having been together for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months</TIMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> specific actions regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> .
     By a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> vote , it allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> to continue offering special discount packages to big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 12</ENAMEX> , rejecting appeals by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> that the discounts were illegal .
     Then by a separate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> vote , it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan , called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 15</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Holiday Corp</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> gave a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 10 %</NUMEX> discount to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Holiday Inns</ENAMEX> , in response to a similar discount offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Holiday Corp.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications Corp</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> said that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> 's offer had expired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> could n't continue to offer its discount plan .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> specifically did n't rule whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> had the right to match offers by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Nacchio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for business-communications services , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> offered a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 15</ENAMEX> discount to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Resort Condominium International</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> , to meet another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> bid .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> `` did n't say I could n't do it again , '' he said .
     Apart from those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> actions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> said they expect to re-examine how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> is regulated since competition has increased .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Firestone</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> 's common-carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> , said he expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> to propose new rules <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> applauded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> 's actions .
     `` The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> said in a statement .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , was displeased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> decision concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariff 12</ENAMEX> , arguing that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> can not be allowed to flaunt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> rules .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">US Sprint</ENAMEX> said was it will petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FCC</ENAMEX> decision in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .

     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> filed a countersuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> accusing it of misleading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight .

     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Billions of investors ' dollars</NUMEX> are pouring out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's junk-bond mutual funds , undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> alone , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an eye-popping $ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> flowed out of the junk funds , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 5 %</NUMEX> of their total assets , according to estimates by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dalbar Financial Services Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two months</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> junk funds have lost a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6 billion</NUMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 15 %</NUMEX> of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalbar</ENAMEX> says .
     It made the estimates based on data collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a dozen</NUMEX> big junk funds .
     Interviews with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund groups</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> -- confirm the trend .
     Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 500 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13 %</NUMEX> of their junk fund assets , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two months</TIMEX> .
     Some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say negative publicity has exacerbated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Brouwer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brouwer &amp; Janachowski</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> .
     The withdrawals could spell trouble for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> junk market .
     If the heavy outflows continue , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weeks ahead</TIMEX> .
     Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems .
     Mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Harvey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dalbar</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     Mutual fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government-bond funds .
     So the impact on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 950 billion</NUMEX> mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tremors</ENAMEX> are likely in the junk-bond market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk , accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a quarter</NUMEX> of the entire high-yield , high-risk market .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 32 billion</NUMEX> .
     Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds , too .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity High Income Fund</ENAMEX> has had a net outflow of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 150 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two months</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">About $ 60 million</NUMEX> streamed out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> alone , double the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> credit squeeze .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 98 %</NUMEX> of the outflow was transferred to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> funds , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Litvack</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , marketing , with most going into money market funds .
     `` You get a news item , it hits , you have strong redemptions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> following -- then go back to normal , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litvack</ENAMEX> .
     The fund , with a cash cushion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> , has `` met all the redemptions without having to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litvack</ENAMEX> says .
     He adds : `` Our fund has had -LCB- positive -RCB- net sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every month</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last three years</TIMEX> -- until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 161 million</NUMEX> flow out since early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 million</NUMEX> of that seeped out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday Oct. 13</TIMEX> alone .
     Still , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the outflow has been steered into other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard</ENAMEX> portfolios , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mattes</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> now holds a cash position of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> .
     At the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 932 million</NUMEX> T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> yanked out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 182 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two months</TIMEX> .
     Those withdrawals , most of which were transferred to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T.

     `` The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">last two months</TIMEX> have been the whole ball game , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Norwitz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     Junk-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> have barely broken even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices .
     Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> , high-yield funds had an average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.85 %</NUMEX> total return -LRB- the price change plus dividends on fund shares -RRB- , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lipper Analytical Services Inc .</ENAMEX>
     That 's even less than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.35 %</NUMEX> total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> 's junk fund has fallen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.08 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> says ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanguard</ENAMEX> fund rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.84 %</NUMEX> ; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T.

     Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> .

     The surprise resignation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> economy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble , as market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> switched out of pounds .
     The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark , falling below the key <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.90</NUMEX>-mark level to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8956 marks</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.9622 marks</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation shocked many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only hours earlier</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's economic policies `` sound '' and said she has `` always supported '' him .
     `` There was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Foley</ENAMEX> , deputy chief economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     `` The resignation came as a great surprise . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Beale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of foreign-exchange operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , added that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> 's later decline .
     `` The market was caught totally the wrong way ... .
     Everyone was extremely long on sterling , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> said .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8400 marks</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8353 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Wednesday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.10 yen</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.52 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     Sterling was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5765</NUMEX> , sharply down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6145</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.02 yen</NUMEX> , up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</NUMEX> .
     Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had much good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects , despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's economic policies .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> , will take time to establish his credibility and , in the meantime , sterling could trend downward in volatile trade .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> predicted few economic policy changes ahead , commenting that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> shares `` a very similar view of the world '' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Chandross</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> economic policies .
     Unless Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation leads to a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> interest-rate policy -- Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> 's exchange-rate mechanism , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandross</ENAMEX> concluded .
     Also announcing his resignation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nemesis</ENAMEX> .
     The pound , which had been trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.6143</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> prior to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's announcement , sank <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than two cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5930</NUMEX> , prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> to buy pounds for dollars .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's move , however , only proved a stopgap to the pound 's slide and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5825</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , who noted that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's release of the preliminary report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> gross national product was something of a nonevent .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> GNP rose at an annual rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     The implicit price deflator , a measure of inflation , was down to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9 %</NUMEX> annual rate of increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> from a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> rate of gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , the dollar ended lower in dull trading .
     The market closed prior to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's announcement .

     On an office wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> hangs a quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> , `` Do n't hold your ticket 'til the show 's over . ''
     He once used that line in a closed-door meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , meaning do n't shrink from taking action against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     So how did a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> like this end up approving a policy that required the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to warn Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> of any coup plot against him ?
     `` I agree , it 's ridiculous , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> , and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> decides to take -- or rather , not to take -- covert action .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> disclosed the policy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> by reading it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> , perhaps as a way of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shifting</ENAMEX> blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> fiasco to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying .
     The policy was contained in an exchange of letters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last October</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Council</ENAMEX> .
     Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">sides</ENAMEX> were busy agreeing with one another about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> could not do to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thug</ENAMEX> .
     They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> himself did n't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told him privately at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     It 's ironic that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> should be in the center of this mire .
     A former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> , he 's a thoughtful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defender</ENAMEX> of presidential powers in foreign policy .
     He 's a rare <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> .
     He 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> most like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Vandenberg</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rayburn</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> of mine , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> says , referring as well to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Rayburn</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> who cooperated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX> .
     `` They allowed this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> to be credible .
     I really want to see that happen again . ''
     If this were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1949</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> might even succeed .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> have other ideas .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last July</TIMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> rejected a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> plan to support a coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Metzenbaum</ENAMEX> refused to support any plan that might get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> hurt , a charming notion for a great power .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> said the plan might violate the assassination ban .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> dropped it .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> rejected a much more modest covert proposal , even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> was agreeing little should be done .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> does n't think all this influenced the failed coup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , but he does concede that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has made mistakes .
     `` In the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Vietnam</ENAMEX> , in the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> , I can understand some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might think that if they plan a coup , they have to bring their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     But even Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> defends congressional oversight .
     Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harvard International Review</ENAMEX> , he says that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> approves covert operations only when there 's a `` consensus . ''
     So what does consensus mean ?
     `` It does n't mean unanimous , '' he insists , though he implies it means a bipartisan majority .
     `` The sustainability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> foreign policy is essential , '' he explains .
     `` Why was containment so successful ?
     Because it had bipartisan support . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Abrams</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> of intelligence committee debates , doubts that even <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Grenada</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> raid would have taken place if `` consensus '' had been required .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rayburn</ENAMEX> were wise enough to leave specific operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> ; modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> notwithstanding , are less modest .
     The result is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> has what amounts to veto power over every covert action .
     `` I would n't say it 's quite a veto , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> demurs .
     But would n't a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who acted despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> objections be taking grave political risks ?
     `` He would , '' agrees the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> .
     `` But that is something the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> ought to know before he goes ahead . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> even spies a silver lining .
     He figures the episode will help `` clarify any ambiguities '' between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     He points to a letter on his desk , his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , saying that they `` do n't disagree . ''
     More broadly , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> will shock <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> out of its fear of using military power .
     `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Vietnam</ENAMEX> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he says .
     Maybe -- if every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> shared the principles of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> .
     But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation .
     Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> , that treats a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> as just another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> at the table .
     The reply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metzenbaums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohens</ENAMEX> is that we ca n't abolish these oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are now in charge of our national security .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests at stake were happily minor ; the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> killed were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> hapless enough to trust <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> will .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> may not be so lucky the next time .

     I was impressed by the perceptiveness of your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 12</TIMEX> story `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Rural Enterprise : Tough Row To Hoe</ENAMEX> . ''
     We lived in rural areas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> , but now live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">St. Louis County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This morning</TIMEX> as I drove <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">the 13 miles</NUMEX> to my law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> journey , I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of an expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> with so many opportunities and where so much is happening .
     The presence of so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to live .
     I thought back to our time in small , sparsely populated communities .
     I remembered how hard it was for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX> to become accepted by long-established , stake-holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> , and what pitfalls awaited an original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinker</ENAMEX> in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging , `` safe '' ways of thought and action .
     I remembered being fired at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 44</TIMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid , small-town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">employer</ENAMEX> .
     How difficult it is for a thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to live among societies rooted in the past .
     Now , I revel in the freedom , culture , activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects .
     Yet when my youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , I buried him in the church <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cemetery</ENAMEX> of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> .
     So after all , even the bitterest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce , rural virtues thought to exist amid fields , forests and country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">lanes</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine Oy</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyard</ENAMEX> that filed for bankruptcy protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's entire shipbuilding industry can be averted .
     At stake are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 10,000</NUMEX> jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Finland</ENAMEX> 's post-war economic revival .
     Shipbuilding became a point of pride as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyards</ENAMEX> remained profitable long after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> collapsed all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     But if , as many now fear , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> joins the ranks of failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyards</ENAMEX> it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Finland</ENAMEX> 's international reputation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyard</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.5 billion Finnish markka</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.54 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- backlog includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> ordered by big international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival Cruise Lines Inc</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> is scheduled to be delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , just in time for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter tourist season</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> is scheduled to be delivered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fall 1990</TIMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fall 1991</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> probably will be delivered close to schedule , but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> may have to pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 25 %</NUMEX> more to get the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> .
     All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bankers</ENAMEX> worry that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> will counter with a hail of lawsuits .
     State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy .
     However , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> cited possible parallels between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> case and the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Norway</ENAMEX> 's state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     In that case , international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's debt carried implicit state guarantees .
     Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> warn .
     Moreover , state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say .
     The decision by a majority of state-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government policy .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyard</ENAMEX> .
     At the time <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>-controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oy Waertsilae</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , the shipbuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> faced potential losses estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one billion markka</NUMEX> and was on the brink of liquidation .
     Under the rescue plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> of its stake to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and pension funds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , in turn , guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were expected to combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , and thus ensure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Finland</ENAMEX> 's survival as a shipbuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> spent most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> pulled out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</TIMEX> .
     After the restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> and bolstered by state loan guarantees , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Bank of Finland</ENAMEX> and state-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Postipankki</ENAMEX> , resumed lending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyard</ENAMEX> working capital .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> got cold feet recently as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> complained they had been misled about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyard</ENAMEX> 's actual financial condition , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> familiar with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's board meeting said it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Postipankki</ENAMEX> to halt lending to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> .
     Then , in a boardroom showdown , state-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> voted to file for bankruptcy , apparently under instructions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Finland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Industry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilkka Suominen</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suominen</ENAMEX> had grown increasingly worried about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">state</ENAMEX> 's potential financial exposure as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> 's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Sweden</ENAMEX> wound up wasting state subsidies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 35 billion Swedish kronor</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.47 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> in a vain attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> suggested that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suominen</ENAMEX> may have decided to cut <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Finland</ENAMEX> 's losses once and for all .
     Senior ministry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> huddled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> operating .
     The talks may drag on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> before any concrete result is announced , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with them said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> solution would be to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipyard</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outsider</ENAMEX> .
     But there appear to be few , if any , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitors</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> once again change tack and agree to pick up the bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     Meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shippers</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessels</ENAMEX> on order from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX> will remain in limbo .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 122 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> due to early retirement of debt .
     The cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">programmer</ENAMEX> said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties , and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just-completed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> 's earnings , but said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> continues to expect to report a net loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt , and the outstanding Class A cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> , was made possible by an offering of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 750 million</NUMEX> of debentures and notes and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</NUMEX> in bank borrowings .
     The offering included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> senior subordinated debentures due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2001</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> coupon liquid yield option notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2004</TIMEX> .
     The notes were priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> and are convertible into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's Class B common stock at a price which represents a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> premium over the market price on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 10 , 1989</TIMEX> .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> called its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 7\/8 %</NUMEX> senior subordinated notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> , with an aggregate principal amount of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> , for redemption on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 15</TIMEX> .
     As a result of the refinancing , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> from slightly more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner</ENAMEX> 's Class A stock closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50.50</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> .
