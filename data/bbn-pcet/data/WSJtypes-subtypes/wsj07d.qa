     The surprise resignations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> top economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> heaped more uncertainty on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's financial markets , which already have been laboring under worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's ailing economy .
     `` The last thing markets like is uncertainty , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Harwood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S.G. Warburg &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , of the resignations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> and chief economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think you 'll see share prices go down , and sterling now is under something of a cloud . ''
     The pound immediately began to take a buffetting after the resignations were announced .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading , sterling stood at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5765</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6145</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> economy is hardly the picture of health <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> , base interest rates are the highest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years</TIMEX> , and the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6 %</NUMEX> annual inflation rate is by far the highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Unions</ENAMEX> are pressing demands for wage increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> despite general belief that economic growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> will be less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> .
     Increasingly , the financial markets are reflecting the gloom .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index has dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</NUMEX> from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2423.9</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 8</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , even before the resignations were announced , the index dove <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32.5</NUMEX> points to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2129.4</NUMEX> .
     `` We are expecting a recession , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Franklin</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schroders</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     `` The only question is , how deep is it going to be ?
     The outlook for corporate earnings is fairly bleak .
     It 's quite likely we 're going to get repeats '' of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> market shocks .
     Red ink already has begun to flow in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> market breaks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 16</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIT Holdings</ENAMEX> , the largest financer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> options and futures markets , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it will incur a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second-half</TIMEX> loss as a result of the market plunge .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , which also will omit its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second-half</TIMEX> dividend , did n't specify the size .
     But company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> estimated that the loss could approach the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Castleman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIT</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , said in an interview that the loss stemmed from the default of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who had bet on a price rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> shares before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     The price plummeted after a proposed leveraged buy-out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> fell through .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIT Holdings</ENAMEX> shares plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36 pence</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">85 cents</NUMEX> -RRB- , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> drop , on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's stock exchange .
     Denizens of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's financial district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows .
     `` A lot more of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are staying until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our 10 p.m. closing time</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Brown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Corney &amp; Barrow Restaurants Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which runs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> tony wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bars</ENAMEX> in the district .
     `` There 's a strong sense among the martini set that there 's more -LCB- bad news -RCB- to come , '' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Yates</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Grenfell Asset Management</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in the stock market were very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> -- very young and wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimists</ENAMEX> .
     Now it 's dawning on them that they can be non-wealthy . ''
     The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry 's deregulation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> come to us saying they 'd like to be back where they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> , in a more collegial atmosphere , with less tension , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Waterhouse</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hanover Partners Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">district head-hunting firm</ENAMEX> .
     But after trading losses in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> market jolts here , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will be lucky to have jobs at all , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> predict .
     The industry , which currently employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 25,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , has shed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,500</NUMEX> jobs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> .
     `` I can see cuts of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 20 %</NUMEX> more , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     The mergers and acquisitions market has been a saving grace for the industry , but uncertainties are beginning to mount even there .
     Intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> takeovers are expected to continue at their brisk pace .
     But investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say that stock market uncertainties in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> may cause many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to mark time before bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , in the hope that share prices will come down .
     `` If prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">States</ENAMEX> go down , industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> have the opportunity of getting reasonable prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois von Hurter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continential M&amp;A</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     But he adds : `` Everybody and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> have opened up M&amp;A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     It 's difficult to see that there 's going to be enough business to go around .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> 's share .
     At the others , there are going to be a lot of disappointments , after all those promises and all that big money that 's been paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     It all adds up to a cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> here .
     Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen D. Wheat</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are just plain scared . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is past worrying about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's blues is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Hartley</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last summer</TIMEX> , he chucked his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbroker</ENAMEX> and headed for the mountains .
     He did n't stop until he got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyo</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'm glad to be out , '' said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">32-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> in a phone interview .
     `` The percentage of your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> spent twiddling your thumbs got greater , and the work day kept getting longer .
     What am I doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX> ?
     Not a great deal .
     My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I will stay through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the skiing season</TIMEX> , or until the money runs out -- whichever comes first .
     But unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , out here I 've never heard anybody blow a car horn in anger .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the move could presage even harsher action by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .

     That , in turn , could substantially reduce the value of the television assets .
     The appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peat Marwick</ENAMEX> , which has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> that specializes in advising troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , came about as a result of a round of meetings held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Skase</ENAMEX> with bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is sharpening its newest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapon</ENAMEX> against white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> : the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills .
     And defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid .
     The issue has come to a boil in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , where federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> have warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Antar</ENAMEX> that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Crazy Eddie Inc.</ENAMEX> is indicted , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> may move to seize the money that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> is using to pay legal fees .
     The warning by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. attorney</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> follows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> .
     In those cases , the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ruled that federal law gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> broad authority to seize assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes , including fees paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> before an indictment .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> succeeds in seizing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> 's assets , he could be left without top-flight legal representation , because his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are likely to quit , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the case .
     A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> -- in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who suffer in the short run are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who suffer in the long run are all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Lefcourt</ENAMEX> , a criminal defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> is being investigated by a federal grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges .
     Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law , or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICO</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's assets before trial .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> 's case , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> issued their warning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure .
     In a letter , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> that because of the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> may be seized .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> have told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> that they believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> 's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> derives from illegal activities .
     Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> even after they are paid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justin Feldman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Arseneault</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> , both declined to comment on the matter .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel A. Alito</ENAMEX> said , `` I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> 's fees to drug cases . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alito</ENAMEX> said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> `` just responded to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> 's question about whether we would go after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> was charged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> in a civil suit filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
     In that suit , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> accused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> of engaging in a `` massive financial fraud '' to overstate the earnings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Crazy Eddie</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Edison</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> period .
     Through his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> has denied allegations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> suit and in civil suits previously filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> and others .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has alleged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> aimed to pump up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> said , made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 60 million</NUMEX> from the sale of his shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1985 and 1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has emphasized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly .
     According to department policy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> must make a strong showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made .
     Still , criminal defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> worry that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> are being deprived of their <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sixth Amendment</ENAMEX> right to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and a fair trial if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> can seize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ' fees .
     They also worry that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly , the best defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid .

     The stock market correction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13 , 1989</TIMEX> , was a grim reminder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Oct. 19 , 1987 market collapse</ENAMEX> .
     Since , like earthquakes , stock market disturbances will always be with us , it is prudent to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse .
     In general , markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances .
     But there are times when they seize up , and panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> can not find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     That 's just what happened in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash .
     As the market tumbled , disorderly market conditions prevailed : The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be executed ; and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> stopped trading altogether .
     These failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages : Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin-calls triggered additional selling pressures .
     The situation was like that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skier</ENAMEX> who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope .
     His skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy-sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control .
     Unable to stop his accelerating descent , he crashes .
     After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , and as a result of the recommendations of many studies , `` circuit breakers '' were devised to allow market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to regroup and restore orderly market conditions .
     It 's doubtful , though , whether circuit breakers do any real good .
     In the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up , as would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> finally get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> on the phone .
     Instead , an appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institution</ENAMEX> should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market : the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> .
     The availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign-exchange markets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities .
     The stock market is the only major market without a market-maker of unchallenged liquidity or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> of last resort .
     This does not mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , it pumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> into the markets through open market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">operations</ENAMEX> and the discount window .
     It lent money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> .
     They , in turn , lent money to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> -- who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> also has the power to set margin requirements .
     But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ?
     Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole .
     The stock market is certainly not too big for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to handle .
     The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Daily</TIMEX> trading volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> foreign exchange market is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 110 billion</NUMEX> .
     The combined value of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> equity trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Exchange</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market ranges <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13 billion</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> injected into the money markets after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day .
     More carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action .
     And taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply , such as happened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious .
     It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> averages at a particular level .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks .
     It would be inappropriate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> or the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to buy or sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> shares .
     Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> could buy the broad market composites in the futures market .
     The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices .
     Stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     Disorderly market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970s</TIMEX> .
     But since the member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> agreed to the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Guidelines to Floating</ENAMEX> '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> , such difficulties have been avoided .
     I can not recall any disorder in currency markets since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> guidelines were adopted .
     Thus , the mere existence of a market-stabilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> helps to avoid panic in emergencies .
     The old saying advises : `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
     But this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> , now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">VISA International</ENAMEX> , was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs .
     `` Caution should ... be the rule of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> in a speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Association of Corporate Treasurers</ENAMEX> ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> dinner .
     `` It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general , to say nothing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions . ''
     His remarks were distributed to the press before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> announced his resignation <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last evening</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> had no comment on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's resignation .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> reiterated that the exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to leveraged deals have n't yet reached `` worrying levels . ''
     However , in light of the risks involved in such transactions , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions , he said .
     In other comments , he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy .
     `` A similar result could sometimes be achieved , at less cost , by changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managements</ENAMEX> , '' he said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> ' marketing efforts , but the `` bugs '' are n't expected to hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> and most computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> familiar with the flaws , found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486</ENAMEX> chip , say the defects do n't affect the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their `` brains '' appear on the market sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> discovered two flaws in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486</ENAMEX> microprocessor chip 's `` floating-point unit '' , a set of circuits that do certain calculations .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> began notifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations .
     But while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> say the bugs will delay products , most big computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> said the flaws do n't affect them .
     `` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Archuleta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> 's advanced systems development .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> that it planned to ship a computer based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> chip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     `` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .
     Likewise , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AST Research Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> said the bugs wo n't delay their development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX>-based machines .
     `` We have n't modified our schedules in any way , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     To switch to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vendor</ENAMEX> 's chips , `` would definitely not be an option , '' he said .
     Nonetheless , concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 cents</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's stock to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32</NUMEX> a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading , on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,609,800</NUMEX> shares , and partly responsible for a drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> plunged further , closing at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> a share , off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.625</NUMEX> a share , on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,633,700</NUMEX> shares .
     Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's decline is being attributed to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings report that came in at the low end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' expectations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> .
     `` We should not be seeing any more , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Rash</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> chip .
     What 's more , the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations , he said , and then very seldom .
     `` These errata do not affect business programs , '' he said .
     The bugs will cause problems in `` specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications '' such as word-processing and spreadsheets , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Slater</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microprocessor Report</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newsletter</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> and others say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> is n't wholly to blame for the snafu .
     The real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">culprits</ENAMEX> , they said , are computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> that have jumped the gun to unveil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX>-based products .
     `` The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archuleta</ENAMEX> .
     `` You can do that but you 're taking a risk .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are paying the price for taking the risk . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late September</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> began shipping a plug-in card that converts its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">PS\/2</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">70-A21</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80386</ENAMEX> machine to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486</ENAMEX> machine .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays .
     `` We do n't look at this as a major problem for us , '' she said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> , which said it discovered the bugs , still plans to announce new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> products on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 6</TIMEX> .
     Because of the glitch , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it does n't know when its machine will be commercially available .
     That 's a break from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> tradition , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't announce products until they 're actually at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> .
     The problem is being ballyhooed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's future flagship .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's personal computers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486</ENAMEX> microprocessor is the spearhead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines .
     `` Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> is an extremely high-profile product , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slater</ENAMEX> , the newsletter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80486</ENAMEX> chip is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Corvette</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's microprocessors , a super-fast , super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are likely to buy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at least several years</TIMEX> .
     Unveiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> , the chip crams <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</NUMEX> transistors on a sliver of silicon , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than four</NUMEX> times as many as on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's earlier model , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">80386</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> clocks the chip 's speed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 million</NUMEX> instructions per second , or MIPs .
     That 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as fast as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">386</ENAMEX> .
     Machines using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers , which connect groups of computers together , and in computer-aided design .
     But while the chip 's speed in processing power is dazzling , it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> is the descendant of a long series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> chips that began dominating the market ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> picked the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">16-bit</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">8088</ENAMEX> chip for its first personal computer .
     -LRB- A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">16-bit</NUMEX> microprocessor processes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">32-bit</NUMEX> chips . -RRB-

     Big personal computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> of engineering workstations are developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX>-based machines , which are expected to reach the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Usinor-Sacilor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , to modernize a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> 's ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BethForge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make cast-iron mill rolls , is part of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-pronged effort to shore up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> that has posted continuing operating losses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> .
     The other element includes consolidating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BethForge</ENAMEX> 's press-forge operations .
     The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 850</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     While the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> affects only a small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> 's operations , it is significant because it marks the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> has joined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> .
     Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> for not following its major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> in linking with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to share costs and provide technology to modernize old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> or build new ones .
     `` We think it 's a step in the right direction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Bello</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">WEFA Group</ENAMEX> 's international steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked . ''
     He said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , one that could open up new markets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> had little choice but to go with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> , because its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> already have tapped the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> noted .
     Under terms of the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Usinor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chavanne-Ketin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> would establish a modernized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> to make cast-iron mill rolls at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's cast-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> here .
     Terms for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , which would be jointly owned by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , were n't disclosed .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Usinor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin caster by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next fall</TIMEX> .
     The caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls , which are basically huge rolling pins used to flatten or shape steel products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> is also working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Steelworkers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> to consolidate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BethForge</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> heat-treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> of the press-forge operations .
     Once the consolidation is complete , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication , hardened steel and large-diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom-die applications .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> that it planned to restructure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BethForge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> to improve its cost structure .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> posted a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> charge related to its plans to realign the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .

     If you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market , consider the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Savings &amp; Loan</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> has just announced a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 226 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> loss .
     How did this happen ?
     Well , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in its recent S&amp;L bailout mandated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> sell off all their junk-bond holdings by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> , it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> have made .
     But there is a grimly ironic twist to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> loss .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know , there is much talk in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and indeed all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> about the need to `` encourage '' long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed obsession with the short term .
     Now , we regard this as a largely phony issue , but the `` long term '' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Beltway</ENAMEX> .
     It turns out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value .
     They could no longer be classified as what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> regarded them , namely long-term investments .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baby Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services .
     The issue of seeking relief from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> was raised to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delbert Staley</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nynex</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staley</ENAMEX> replied : `` Legislation tends to be compromised .
     I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> and through state and federal regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     I see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> as a last resort . ''
     Healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky .
     The reality of life in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> is that if you want to wreck something that works , let it fall into the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> said it will move its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> .
     Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's midtown headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> -- including much of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> -- were unaware of the plan until informed at a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> meeting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence G. Rawl</ENAMEX> .
     The shift wo n't affect operations .
     As part of its restructuring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> moved most of those out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> and sold its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">skyscraper</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But the pullout is an embarrassment to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> is in the process of vacating its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> here , and huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.C. Penney &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> have recently left .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> , informed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it .
     `` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Grayson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy mayor</ENAMEX> for finance and economic development .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> welcomed the move .
     City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> there had been were aware that a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was moving in , but negotiations had all been conducted through a law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> and under the code name `` Everglades . ''
     `` When we were told it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> , it was beyond all expectations ; what a coup , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lewis</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dallas Partnership</ENAMEX> , the economic development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , its economy based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> and real estate , has been in a slump .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> said it will build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">132-acre</NUMEX> tract in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">10-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> in the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Irving</ENAMEX> .
     Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> is completed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> will rent part of an existing office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> , once a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ranch</ENAMEX> , is a sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> of office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> have been struggling to populate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said it will cost less to run its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> wo n't say how much it will save , but during at its interim location , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> say it will likely pay rent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 to $ 15</NUMEX> per square foot .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Owners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> say they will be asking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50</NUMEX> per square foot for rent to fill the space that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> is vacating .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , taxes and development costs are also lower , they said .
     Plus , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said , by eliminating the typically long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> commutes between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> and home , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 hours</TIMEX> a week in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , rather than a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">work week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .

     In testimony to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> disputed the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> , who told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> might be closed .
     He added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> already has the power to close the markets in an emergency .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> argued that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> are under such stress that they should be closed .
     Separately , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> said he asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Working Group on Financial Markets</ENAMEX> to determine whether futures margins are too low .
     He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     `` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> said .
     Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract .
     Margins on the futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> margins for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stock-index futures stood at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10,000</NUMEX> a contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">hedgers</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 16 , 1987</TIMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> the hedging margin was raised to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7,500</NUMEX> .
     Margins were raised or lowered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> times since the crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> .
     Currently , they stand at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12,000</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> , who are typically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and non-member <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6,000</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">hedgers</ENAMEX> , which are usually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to `` end under -LRB- its -RRB- own weight . ''
     Asked whether there is anything <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> should do to curb the LBO boom , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> responded , `` I think the LBO phenomenon , -LRB- while -RRB- it wo n't stop completely , will be a thing of the past . ''
     Before taking any action , he advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> to `` see what the market has produced as a cure . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> also agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility , and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> from investing in stocks .
     But he added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> still are participating in the equity market indirectly through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mutual funds</ENAMEX> and pension funds .
     The former Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading , which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     `` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> endorsed the market-revision bill that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> will try to push through this session .
     That bill , proposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , would require brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to disclose the financial positions of their holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , mandate large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">traders</ENAMEX> ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets .
     The bill also would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> the power to close the markets , a discretion that former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> wanted but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> does n't .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> agreed to have their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> meet within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next week</TIMEX> to start fine-tuning the bill .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Agriculture Committee</ENAMEX> is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Futures Trading Practices Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> futures markets .
     However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve .
     The complex bill , introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Leahy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vt.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lugar</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Kerrey</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated .
     These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , and exchange governance .
     The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct .
     Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry .
     Indeed , some of the bill 's requirements , including broad representation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coffee , Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange</ENAMEX> and other futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> , the industry and ultimately the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most prominent features is the requirement that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill .
     We would be delighted to have such a system in place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     But is it realistic for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies ?
     What if the system does n't work ?
     What if the only system that does work is so expensive that , at best , only the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> can afford it ?
     Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before .
     Today , trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard .
     All foreign markets are aggressively courting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> need both market integrity and cost-efficiency ; long-term growth depends on it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading .
     The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of `` service fees , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and foreign markets .
     Other provisions have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages .
     In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , these measures could have other , far-reaching repercussions .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> liable for damages without willful misconduct .
     Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances .
     It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation .
     In an already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> , depriving the private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> of access to the markets .
     Another measure makes commodity brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> liable for violations committed by independent floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> who execute trades for them .
     This untried concept would expose these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to potentially astronomical punitive damages .
     Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     This would force out of business many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that function as floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity .
     Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue .
     In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure .
     The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> , even though in some cases trading with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> .
     Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> trades for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets .
     All <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .
     Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CFTC</ENAMEX> carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are .
     The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
     When problems surface , the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than 100 years</TIMEX> .
     That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications , positive and negative , of the proposed resolutions to those problems , and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades .

     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> said you act as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stimulant</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX> tells him , `` a diversion to relieve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's boredom . ''

     They also chart the evolution of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> that has grown tenfold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">lifetime</TIMEX> , from a colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">outpost</ENAMEX> of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">slum</ENAMEX> choking on its own refuse .

     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Beginning and the End</ENAMEX> , '' easily the best of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> , belongs to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> 's `` realistic '' period and it is the one for which he is most renowned .
     Published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1949</TIMEX> , it follows the decline of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cairo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> often compare to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balzac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galsworthy</ENAMEX> .
     A minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> dies suddenly , dooming his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to poverty and eventual disgrace .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> turns to dressmaking , then to peddling herself for a few piasters .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> can succeed , while another helps support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with money siphoned from crime .
     The real tragedy , though , lies not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances .
     Mourning for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pauper</ENAMEX> 's grave .
     The family moves to another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> to conceal shabby belongings from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> .
     And the successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> wishes his embarrassing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> dead .
     As a critique of middle-class mores , the story is heavy-handed .
     But its unsentimental sketches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cairo</ENAMEX> life are vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> .
     We see , smell and hear slums filled with `` the echoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language , rattling coughs and the sound of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> . ''
     And we meet engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crooks</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX> `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> , '' famed for his head-butting fights , his whoring and his hashish .
     `` ` God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings , ' he tells his worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX> comes to a bad end , but so does almost everyone else in the book .
     If the setting is exotic , the prose is closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balzac</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Pere Goriot</ENAMEX> '' than it is to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Arabian Nights</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> , and he modeled his work on Western classics .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense , this limits him ; unlike a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</ENAMEX> , who has a distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> voice , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> 's style offers little that can be labeled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> . ''
     But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cairo</ENAMEX> come alive for the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> as vividly as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dostoevski</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Petersburg</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Thief and the Dogs</ENAMEX> , '' written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1961</TIMEX> , is a taut , psychological drama , reminiscent of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Crime and Punishment</ENAMEX> . ''

     `` I am the hope and the dream , the redemption of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowards</ENAMEX> , '' he says in one of many interior monologues .
     Later , he recalls the words of his <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ! Theft ! The holy fire ! ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said</ENAMEX> 's story reflects the souring of socialism under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasser</ENAMEX> , whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1952</TIMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1961</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> 's idealism had vanished or become twisted , as it has in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said</ENAMEX> .
     His giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets '' by punishing the `` real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX> '' -- the rich `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> '' who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX> , and eventually to his own .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cairo</ENAMEX> 's spirited squalor also has gone gray .
     Here , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> is dark and laden with symbolism : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said</ENAMEX> has left his jail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cell</ENAMEX> only to enter the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cairo</ENAMEX> society .
     While the theme is compelling , the plot and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are not .
     We never care about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said</ENAMEX> or the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypocrites</ENAMEX> '' he hunts .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Thief and the Dogs</ENAMEX> '' is a pioneering work , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stream-of-consciousness novel in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> , but it is likely to disappoint Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> novel `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Wedding Song</ENAMEX> '' also is experimental , and another badly aimed bullet .
     The story of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> 's stage debut unfolds in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-person monologues , in the manner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faulkner</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Sound and the Fury</ENAMEX> . ''
     But the device obscures more than it illuminates .
     Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art , and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world .
     But again , the themes get tangled in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> 's elliptical storytelling .
     The indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Arab</ENAMEX> world .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahfouz</ENAMEX> has been pilloried and censored for questioning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> and advocating peace with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Israel</ENAMEX> .
     Veiling his message has helped him endure .
     Art , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Wedding Song</ENAMEX> , '' is `` the surrogate for the action that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX> like me is unable to take . ''
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Wedding Song</ENAMEX> '' gives glimpses of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cairo</ENAMEX> that has become so much harsher since his youth , when , as he once said , `` the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was able to find his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bread</ENAMEX> and without great difficulty .

     Ground zero of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> 's `` discretionary fund , '' a honey pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> channels .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> wants to abolish it .
     Instead , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28.4 million</NUMEX> .
     And transfer control of much of it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals will simply continue , but under new mismanagement .
     After one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C-SPAN</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> voted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> to order <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28.4 million</NUMEX> in spending for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">library</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Pierce</ENAMEX> 's tenure .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> has no paper work whatsoever on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> of the projects , none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them .
     However , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> district of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Traxler</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> that writes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> spending bill .
     Of course , this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called `` constituent service '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> , while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> is labeled `` influence peddling . ''
     Unlike those awful <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> do n't profit directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> projects .
     They merely collect campaign contributions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> that help keep them in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> and some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> after it returned from a conference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> that was called to resolve differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> versions .
     Conference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> are breeding grounds for mischief .
     They are often closed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and no minutes are taken .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> .
     In this case , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> outdid themselves .
     They transferred <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 28 million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Community Development Block Grant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">program</ENAMEX> designated largely for low - and moderate-income projects and funneled it into such items as : -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 million</NUMEX> for a performing-arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> , -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 million</NUMEX> for `` job retention '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mills</ENAMEX> . -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400,000</NUMEX> for a collapsing utility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tunnel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salisbury</ENAMEX> , -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> for `` equipment and landscaping to deter crime and aid police surveillance '' at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> . -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450,000</NUMEX> for `` integrated urban data based in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .

     This is slightly adapted from remarks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 7</TIMEX> by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George P. Shultz</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> gathering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford Business School</ENAMEX> , where he has returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> :
     I was struck <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> by the drug-interdiction effort in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bahamas</ENAMEX> .
     We had intercepted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> street value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cocaine</ENAMEX> .
     I do n't know how much got through .
     Nobody has any credible estimate .
     The GNP of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bahamas</ENAMEX> is probably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">somewhere between one and two billion dollars</NUMEX> .
     So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> has brought about .
     I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem .
     The efforts to get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , to strongly discourage use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important .
     But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work .
     The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> when I was budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">treasury</ENAMEX> with jurisdiction over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Customs</ENAMEX> .
     We designed a comprehensive program , and we worked hard on it .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> we designed a comprehensive program ; we worked very hard on it .
     Our international efforts were far greater than ever before .
     You 're looking at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> whose motorcade was attacked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bolivia</ENAMEX> by the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> , so I 'm personally a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> of this war .
     What we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control .
     These efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost .
     With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it .
     It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it .
     Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost .
     When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pushers</ENAMEX> have to go around and get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> addicted , so that they create a market for themselves .
     They wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market .
     So I think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way .
     If I am catching your attention , then read a bold and informative article in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this September</TIMEX> 's issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Science</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethan Nadelmann</ENAMEX> on this subject .
     We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     I find it very difficult to say that .
     Sometimes at a reception or cocktail party I advance these views and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> head for somebody else .
     They do n't even want to talk to you .
     I know that I 'm shouting into the breeze here as far as what we 're doing now .
     But I feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now , the next time around , when we have the next iteration of these programs , it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it .
     No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> wants to say what I just said , not for a minute .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy grew at a moderate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , the same pace as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , despite the worst trade performance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported .
     Personal spending , buoyed by a burst of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">automobile</ENAMEX> buying , was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion .
     But trade , one of the economy 's main forces in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> , showed a sharp deterioration .
     Imports of goods and services soared , while exports were flat .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> found the mixture ominous .
     `` For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> , the foreign trade sector has been a major contributor to economic growth .
     You ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Robertson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mellon Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     Although the economy showed no change of pace from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect it to slow considerably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> as demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> falls , partly because of higher prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> think the rise in the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> will further crimp progress in trade , because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper .
     And business investment -- which slowed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , according to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's report -- is expected to continue to be sluggish .
     A sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced .
     An inflation gauge that measures the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> .
     Much of the moderation came from declining energy prices , which have since turned up a bit , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     Consequently , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Darby</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undersecretary</ENAMEX> for economic affairs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> , said inflation probably will edge up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third-quarter</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the final three months of 1989</TIMEX> .
     But he said he believes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> rate `` will prove to have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's peak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> inflation rate . ''
     Generally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eighth year</TIMEX> of sustained growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> called the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> pace `` good , solid growth , '' although he said he expects the expansion to slow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     He added : `` Inflation is lower than I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> expected it to be , and I think that 's good news . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's trade of goods and services swelling to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 74 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 51 billion</NUMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darby</ENAMEX> called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again .
     `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Van Dyke</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> forecasting at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     `` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's major trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">partners</ENAMEX> are strong and prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> products are still competitive .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .
     While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP , it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs .
     According to the report , inventories outside the farm sector grew at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 24.6 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , up from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.5 billion</NUMEX> pace in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' stocks fattened at an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.4 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.3 billion</NUMEX> .
     `` That suggests there is a little more inventory overhang than some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> expected , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Boss</ENAMEX> , senior financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't think it 's anything that 's going to cause a downturn in economic activity .
     But it will slow production . ''
     Devastation from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , which slammed into the Southeast coast in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , diminished personal income by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 4 billion</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said , but it called the effect on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 5 trillion</NUMEX> economy `` negligible .

     Except for the loss from the hurricane , all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Iverson Technology Corp.</ENAMEX> was one of the fastest-growing small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> -- until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">McLean</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> modifies computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands .
     From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , its earnings soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-fold , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 million</NUMEX> , on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-fold increase in revenue , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.1 million</NUMEX> .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , it ran into a buzz saw : a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Department</ENAMEX> spending freeze .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Iverson</ENAMEX> 's earnings plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 million</NUMEX> .
     The troubles continued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year 's first half</TIMEX> , when profit plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 302,000</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Iverson Technology</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of many small defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> besieged by the slowdown in defense spending .
     Unlike larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are suffering big drops in business as once-lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive .
     As their varied strategies suggest , there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> way to respond to a disaster -- though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off .
     For many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , the instinctive first response is to cut costs .
     Others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created by budget-cutting .
     More venturesome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are applying their skills in commercial fields .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ERC International Inc.</ENAMEX> , which provides professional and technical services to the military , is refining its defense niche , not retreating from it .
     After quadrupling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> earnings over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fairfax</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> drop in earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year 's first half</TIMEX> .
     In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Department</ENAMEX> priority , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ERC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">W.J. Schafer Associates</ENAMEX> , a technical and scientific analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative .
     While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.J. Schafer</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contracts totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.4 million</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ERC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Aalseth</ENAMEX> , says he bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> `` more for its technology than its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UNC Inc.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Annapolis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> that earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.8 million</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400.4 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , has gone even further in realigning its military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     As orders for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">submarine</ENAMEX> parts dwindled , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> of steady growth ended with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</NUMEX> drop in income in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year 's first half</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> hit on a new strategy : If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Department</ENAMEX> is so intent on saving money , why not make money off that trend ?
     Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's current efforts : repairing old parts at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> of the cost of replacing them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UNC</ENAMEX> also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's cost , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is running a program to train <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> .
     It is also taking over the maintenance of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> used .
     In another approach , tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Iverson Technology</ENAMEX> is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Iverson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , says he hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can eventually get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to half</NUMEX> of its revenue from commercial markets .
     For now , he says , `` we 're looking at buying some small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with niche markets in the personal-computer business . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Visher Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> .
     The product automates an array of functions performed at small to medium-size printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iverson</ENAMEX> says there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for the software in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , area alone .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">QuesTech Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Falls Church</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , also has acquired some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> outside the military market .
     Moreover , it 's trying to transfer its skill at designing military equipment to commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> .
     A partnership with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Williamsburg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Oil Co.</ENAMEX> recently patented a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't melt in microwave ovens .
     `` We 're trying to take the imagination and talent of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and come up with new processes for industry , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Salvatori</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">QuesTech</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvatori</ENAMEX> should know .
     Instead of helping his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in the defense spending slowdown , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dynamic Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX> , a troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> that makes wind <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tunnels</ENAMEX> for the space industry , contributed to much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">QuesTech</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.3 million</NUMEX> loss on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55.6 million</NUMEX> in revenue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .

     Following a tripling of earnings , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.9 million</NUMEX> , on a doubling of revenue , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116 million</NUMEX> , over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> , earnings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal first quarter</TIMEX> , which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> , plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45,000</NUMEX> . A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time write-off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame , but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Army</ENAMEX> and delays in getting paid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telos</ENAMEX> responded by combining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> to reduce expenses and `` bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Conger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder</ENAMEX> .
