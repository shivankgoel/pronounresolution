     Although his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Francisco Giants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Lurie</ENAMEX> hopes to have a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> for them .
     He is an avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> of a proposition on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> 's ballot to help build a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">replacement</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> .
     Small wonder , since he 's asking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> to sink up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> into the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> digs out from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">The Pretty Big One</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> say the last thing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> can afford is an expensive new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> craze is sweeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     It 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> .
     Something like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> are thinking about new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadiums</ENAMEX> , ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Petersburg</ENAMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boosters</ENAMEX> claim the new sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complexes</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">moneymakers</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Pepperdine University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Baim</ENAMEX> scoffs at that .
     He has looked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> baseball and football <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadiums</ENAMEX> and found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> -- private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Dodger Stadium</ENAMEX> -- brought more money into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> than it took out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Stadiums</ENAMEX> tend to redistribute existing wealth within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> , not create more of it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> rejected a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballpark</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> turned thumbs down on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> stadium bond and tax proposition .
     Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> fielded every important interest on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> -- a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> , the major media -- and spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> on promotion .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> decided that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> concede the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballpark</ENAMEX> is at best running even in the polls .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Christopher</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> who built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> , wo n't endorse the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballpark</ENAMEX> .
     He says he had <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick</ENAMEX> built because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Giants</ENAMEX> claimed they needed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> parking spaces .
     Since the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">park</ENAMEX> will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1,500</NUMEX> spaces , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> .
     Stadium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boosters</ENAMEX> claim that without public money they would never be built .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Miami Dolphins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Robbie</ENAMEX> disagrees , and he can prove it .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Several years ago</TIMEX> he gave up trying to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> to improve its city-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Orange Bowl</ENAMEX> , and instead built his own <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">coliseum</ENAMEX> with private funds .
     He did n't see why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
     `` This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> shows that anything <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> can do , we can do better , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robbie</ENAMEX> says .
     But to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon Landrieu</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Orleans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> who helped build that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's cavernous , money-losing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Superdome</ENAMEX> , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Superdome</ENAMEX> is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
     `` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX> could n't have justified his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">pyramids</ENAMEX> any better .
     But civilization has moved forward since then .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaohs</ENAMEX> , or let private money erect these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">playgrounds</ENAMEX> for public passions .

     Wall Street 's big securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
     The reason : Risks from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
     The downgrading of debt issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> , coupled with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> announcement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
     Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are among the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> operations .
     The biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` Just as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> bull market transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 1990s</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher T.

     `` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">months ahead</TIMEX> .
     What worries credit-rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> the most is that Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
     That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     `` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> may become longer-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX> than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Bowman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> , which raised a warning flag for the industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> when it downgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> .
     `` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahoney</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> .
     Merchant banking , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
     In addition , he says , the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .
     In a leveraged buy-out , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> acquires a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's operations or sales of its assets .
     In a recent report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">century</TIMEX> in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''
     It said that the `` temptation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managements</ENAMEX> to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's reliance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's profit .
     The recent cash squeeze at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's most lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the decade</TIMEX> , is proving costly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> because it arranged more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , a big loan that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> made to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress Co .</ENAMEX> was n't repaid on time when its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450 million</NUMEX> junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was withdrawn .
     `` These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> 's equity , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said .
     `` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's equity . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> , however , benefits from the backing of its largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> also has been an aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">participant</ENAMEX> in the leveraged buy-out business .
     But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> stock market crash .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's listed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> of capital is overstated , according to the rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> , because it includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> of goodwill .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> `` really only has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> of capital , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is n't worried .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> also had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .
     `` After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> of talks , our rating was maintained . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
     The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> , the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter</ENAMEX> in that market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> also has been hit with big financial settlements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> stemming from its guilty plea to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> almost in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just over 5,000</NUMEX> .
     Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> circulated a private financial statement among several securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> showing that its earnings performance has diminished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
     `` We 're well positioned with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 billion</NUMEX> of capital , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` And as a leading investment and merchant banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
     Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> on the Street in reducing costs , which are down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 40 %</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last six months</TIMEX> .

     Most recently , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veraldi</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">59 years old</TIMEX> , has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of product and manufacturing engineering at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co .</ENAMEX>
     But he is best known in the auto industry as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of a team car-development approach that produced the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> midsized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> that were instrumental in helping the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">auto maker</ENAMEX> record profits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> and in enabling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> to eclipse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> as the top-selling nameplate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Under the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Team Taurus</ENAMEX> approach , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veraldi</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> sought the involvement of parts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> , assembly-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> and financial staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from the initial stages of the development cycle .
     The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
     It was later applied to other new-car programs , including those that produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Thunderbird</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Cougar</ENAMEX> .

     The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">defendants</ENAMEX> must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm .
     We can understand and share the compassion that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> sometimes wish to offer a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomonic</ENAMEX> aid to those who 've been hurt .
     But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> as the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">forum</ENAMEX> this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> has to debate risk , technology and innovation .
     Too often now , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">From the 1940s until 1971</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some two million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> took the synthetic hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">diethylstilbestrol</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> -RRB- to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness .
     The drug was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> and marketed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 300</NUMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , often under generic labels .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> .
     The cases quickly went to court , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> could n't recall whose brand they used .
     Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> decided to suspend the common-law rule that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> must prove that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> are the ones who are liable .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Courts</ENAMEX> made the assumption that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> in the proportion of their share of the original sales .
     This has some logic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">Drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> should n't be able to duck liability because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could n't identify precisely which identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> was used .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> quickly tumbled down a slippery slope .
     Just as all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> are not alike , it turns out that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">defendants</ENAMEX> marketed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> differently and may have offered different warranties .
     The ultimate result came in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hymowitz</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> , where the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> that could prove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindy Hymowitz</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Duke University</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Van Alstyne</ENAMEX> notes , by this reasoning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> could be held liable in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">defendants</ENAMEX> .
     The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> or to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> reversed direction to make it much harder to win <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> cases because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> rejected strict liability for prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , citing the huge , hidden social costs .
     `` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Bendectin</ENAMEX> , off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
     This raises the key issue : What to do about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who suffer serious injuries from beneficial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> ?
     We now know that holding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> wo n't be available to anyone .
     As liability <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Huber</ENAMEX> tells us , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hymowitz</ENAMEX> case , if any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> introduces an anti-miscarriage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> `` it 's time to sell that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock short . ''
     We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency-fee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> take a big cut either way .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> would be better off if their cases were taken out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> could create a compensation program to help such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> while protecting the national interest in encouraging new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     But a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">vaccines</ENAMEX> with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation .
     Everyone by now understands that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> without its becoming some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion-dollar</NUMEX> morass .
     We have no doubt this is one reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> are willing to trash the law in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DES</ENAMEX> cases .
     They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> came before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Agriculture Committee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's intention to send <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 100 million</NUMEX> in food aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> , with more to come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Ackerman</ENAMEX> noted that past food aid had harmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">El Salvador</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Egypt</ENAMEX> .
     However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> .
     The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .
     It should be constantly stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> mostly need a real market for their products .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oshkosh Truck</ENAMEX> attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks edged up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in relatively active but unfocused trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> shares finished moderately higher .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , the Nikkei index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> selected issues , which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.99</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35564.43</NUMEX> .
     In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , the Nikkei index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63.79</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35500.64</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> 's volume on the First Section was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900 million</NUMEX> shares , in line with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">909 million</NUMEX> .
     Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing issues , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">454</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">451</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> switched trading focus quickly as they did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     Speculation , on the other hand , sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues , though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue .
     The development , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said , showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market 's recent directionless trend .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> led the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> by actively trading for their own accounts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Institutions</ENAMEX> mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar .
     The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.05</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.46</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05 %</NUMEX> , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2691.19</NUMEX> .

     Volume in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 million</NUMEX> shares , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akio Yamamoto</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Investment Trust Management</ENAMEX> , said that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> federal funds rate declines to around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.5 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bridgestone\/Firestone</ENAMEX> , which advanced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , declined on profit-taking .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> 's dominant issue was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance</ENAMEX> , which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying .
     It ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">56 cents</NUMEX> -RRB- to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,880 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.15</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> interest was directed toward oil and mining shares , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> called a `` defensive '' action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Teikoku Oil</ENAMEX> , also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying , advanced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,460</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Showa Shell</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,570</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Oil</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sumitomo Metal Mining</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">692</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nippon Mining</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">960</NUMEX> .
     Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">winners</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nippon Shokubai</ENAMEX> , which was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,410</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marubeni</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">890</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's blue-chip stocks .
     The Financial Times-Stock Exchange <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX> points higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2160.1</NUMEX> .
     It rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2141.7</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 40 minutes</TIMEX> of trading .
     The index ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> near its session high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163.2</NUMEX> , which was posted within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half-hour</TIMEX> of trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> interest was focused on defensive blue-chip stocks , particularly those with limited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> exposure .
     Also , several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     Sterling 's firm tone , combined with a steady opening on Wall Street , also tempted some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to come back to the market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said .
     There were concerns <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the day</TIMEX> that Wall Street 's sharp gains on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> were overdone and due for a reversal .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FT</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-share index settled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.7</NUMEX> points higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1738.1</NUMEX> .
     Volume was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">372.9 million</NUMEX> shares , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">334.5 million</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market 's recent technical rally might prove fragile .
     They cited Wall Street 's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market 's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> luxury auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> being pursued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> , gained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 cents</NUMEX> -RRB- a share to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">879 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.90</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     It shed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 7 pence</NUMEX> , however , after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said the market was disappointed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> did n't move to tender a bid for control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> to waive its protective `` golden share '' in the auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> raised prospects of a bidding war between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> .
     But the waiver also was seen as a signal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> auto industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> , was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX> , which is being pursued by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake Investments</ENAMEX> , rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">753</NUMEX> on speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> will sweeten its bid , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reed International</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">397</NUMEX> despite reporting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7 %</NUMEX> drop in interim pretax profit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the fall in pretax profit was due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> , and that its remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are performing well .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market agreed .
     Stocks boosted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">market-makers</ENAMEX> shopping to cover book requirements in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> shares included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carlton Communications</ENAMEX> , which climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">778</NUMEX> .
     Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in the key index also notched gains as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">market-makers</ENAMEX> searched for stock in anticipation of demand due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sector</ENAMEX> 's defensive qualities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">666</NUMEX> on a modest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1 million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> 's largest pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 14.13</NUMEX> .
     Stock prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> and lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> .

     Despite a deluge of economic news , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> 's huge debt offering .
     `` There were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Camilli</ENAMEX> , a money market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , the giant computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> of non-callable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> debentures priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.47 %</NUMEX> , or about 1\/2 percentage point higher than the yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
     The size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's issue was increased from an originally planned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> as money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> scrambled to buy the bonds .
     In the investment-grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Ednie</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> industrial bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     Money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> because large issues of long-term debt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with triple-A credit are infrequent .
     Syndicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and other institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> paid scant attention to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy .
     `` Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lieberman</ENAMEX> , a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> while construction spending was slightly lower .
     Both indicators were viewed as signs that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all .
     A survey by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and the latest report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Purchasing Management</ENAMEX> blurred that picture of the economy .
     In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> report prepared for use at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Open Market Committee</ENAMEX> meeting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 14</TIMEX>. , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> .
     Among other things , the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> and among industries .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">districts</ENAMEX> , for example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> noted that business expanded .
     The purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> index of economic activity rose in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , although it remains below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     A reading below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> suggests that the industry is expanding .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX> said the diverse showing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . ''
     The employment report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices , is due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     The average estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> forecast a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> rise in the unemployment rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     In a surprise announcement , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond rather than create a new one for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> refunding of the federal debt .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> will raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> in fresh cash by selling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 billion</NUMEX> of securities , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> notes and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes .
     But rather than sell new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> will issue <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">29year , nine-month</TIMEX> bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond that was sold at the previous refunding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Credit market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 1\/8 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 2019</TIMEX> , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's intent is to help government bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> gauge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
     Until such action takes places , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> has no ability to issue new debt of any kind .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/4</NUMEX> point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The benchmark was priced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 22\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.88 %</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 12\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes were quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 22\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.88 %</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 16\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> .
     The discount rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills was essentially unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.79 %</NUMEX> , while the rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills was slightly lower at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.52 %</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.60 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     Corporate Issues
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market .
     Meanwhile , most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 1\/8</NUMEX> point higher .
     In its latest compilation of performance statistics , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service</ENAMEX> found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> while junk bonds showed a negative return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said those returns compare with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</NUMEX> total return for longer-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes and bonds .
     Total return measures price changes and interest income .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year to date</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said total returns were topped by the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.5 %</NUMEX> of longer-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> issues , closely followed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> for investment-grade bonds .
     Junk bonds trailed the group again .
     `` Even the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2 %</NUMEX> return from the risk-free <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bill has easily outdistanced the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1 %</NUMEX> return from junk bonds , '' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lonski</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's market report .
     `` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said the average net asset value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> junk-bond mutual funds fell by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> .
     Mortgage-Backed Issues
     Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 5\/8</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2\/32</NUMEX> , and its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1\/2 %</NUMEX> issue at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 22\/32</NUMEX> , also up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2\/32</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities were yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.32 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life .
     Activity was light in derivative markets , with no new issues priced .
     Municipal Issues
     Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> point in light , cautious trading prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> 's unemployment report .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 114 million</NUMEX> issue of health facility revenue bonds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health Facilities Financing Authority</ENAMEX> was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> for the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the reason for the delay , but market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> interest , were responsible .
     The issue could be relaunched , possibly in a restructured form , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as next week</TIMEX> , according to the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter</ENAMEX> .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 107.03 million</NUMEX> offering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Ana</ENAMEX> bonds were tentatively priced to yield from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.40 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.458 %</NUMEX> in
     Bucking the market trend , an issue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 million</NUMEX> general obligation distributable state aid bonds from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , apparently drew solid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> interest .
     They were tentatively priced to yield from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.20 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.272 %</NUMEX> in
     Foreign Bond
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> said there was little interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> bond issue .
     So far , they said , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to raise the coupon to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 7 %</NUMEX> .
     It is generally expected to be the usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four billion mark</NUMEX> issue .
     Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six billion mark</NUMEX> issue , or that the last Bund , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> issue due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> , would be increased by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two billion marks</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> said it referred the takeover to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</ENAMEX> because of the purchase 's possible effects on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> market for distribution of replacement tires .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> , an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's clean-air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> on a centerpiece issue : <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">acid rain</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> 's proposal , which is expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , is described by government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> as significantly weaker than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">acid rain</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's plan could cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , mainly those that use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">coal</ENAMEX> , up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> a year .
     The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and temporarily throws into chaos the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> 's work on clean-air legislation .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> close to the utility industry said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">seven-million-ton</NUMEX> cut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">sulfur-dioxide</ENAMEX> emissions that lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">acid rain</ENAMEX> , though additional cuts could be ordered later .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">10 million tons</NUMEX> -- basically in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> -- by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> .
     Although final details were n't available , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> plan would abandon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">the president</ENAMEX> 's proposal for a cap on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">sulfur-dioxide</ENAMEX> emissions .
     That proposal had been hailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> but despised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> because they feared it would limit their growth .
     It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">polluters</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , sparing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , apparently in an attempt to appease <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Midwestern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> from high-polluting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> who insist on cost-sharing .
     It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">acid-rain</ENAMEX> plan .
     While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , it might not win the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fuels</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> representing some of the cleaner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> have been quietly working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">acid-rain</ENAMEX> concerns .

     A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast .
     Several moves were taken following the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures rise or fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points .
     The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , S&amp;P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous day</TIMEX> 's close for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX> .
     If , when trading resumes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> points from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous day</TIMEX> 's close , a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> trading halt takes effect .
     Also , the reforms allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to halt trading for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> points , and for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two more hours</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> slides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 150</NUMEX> points on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same day</TIMEX> .
     DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1976</TIMEX> , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing .
     A faster version , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">SuperDot</ENAMEX> , was launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> .
     Used by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and others to zip orders into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">SuperDot</ENAMEX> handles <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</NUMEX> of all orders entered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy -LRB- for those who have purchased a contract -RRB- or deliver -LRB- for those who sold one -RRB- a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date .
     Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due .
     Indexing -- Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&amp;P 500 .
     Many institutional index funds are active program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> , swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so .
     Program trading -- A wide range of computer-assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> or more stocks .
     Quant -- Generally , any Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> who employs quantitive research techniques .
     The newest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> , also called `` rocket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> '' because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics , devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading .
     Stock-index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock-index futures or options .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options .
     If stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for example , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrager</ENAMEX> will buy stocks and sell futures .
     Stock-index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date .
     The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount .
     The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard &amp; poor 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index -LRB- traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; the Major Market Index , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average -LRB- traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; and the S&amp;P 100 options -LRB- traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , and based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> stocks selected from the S&amp;P 500 -RRB- .
     Stock-index options -- Options give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> the right , but not the obligation , to buy -LRB- a call -RRB- or sell -LRB- a put -RRB- a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known as the strike price .
     For stock indexes , the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index .
     For example , there are options on the S&amp;P 500 futures contract and on the S&amp;P 100 index .
     Uptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX> sought federal permission to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 15 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> , saying he might seek control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     Although takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> said they doubted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> will make a bid by himself , the application by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid .
     Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> that might seek control .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings , which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold .
     Takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were puzzled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> filing and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> will definitely seek control .
     `` Maybe he just wants to make something happen , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> may be trying to position himself as a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who could help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX> revive a failed labor-management bid .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> , he suggested , could replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> , which has withdrawn from the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> had already bought and sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share labor-management buy-out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> acquired a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year</TIMEX> at an average cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110</NUMEX> a share , and reduced its stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> accepted the bid at prices higher than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 282</NUMEX> a share .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> has already sold its entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .
     But the exact amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed .
     The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston Partners</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manager</ENAMEX> , has bought <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock and may challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to remain independent .
     Speculation about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> has caused the stock to rebound from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's announcement came after the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     In composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading , the shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 177</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate .
     Some takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> were skeptical , saying it was possible that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> is thought to be on friendly terms with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> was instrumental in tapping Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> to run the air cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger International Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> 's success in that job helped him land the top job with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1987</TIMEX> .
     But any potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acquirer</ENAMEX> must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , primarily its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and the powerful machinists ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , which has opposed a takeover .
