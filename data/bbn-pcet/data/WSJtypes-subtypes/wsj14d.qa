     Growth is good .
     At least , that 's a theme emerging among many money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and to catch the next wave of above-average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">performers</ENAMEX> .
     They are starting to buy growth stocks .
     Remember them ?
     The upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> whose profits of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1970s</TIMEX> grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin .
     That sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     The current flood of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones .
     Those are unwelcome trends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> so far , even with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point plunge on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood .
     The question for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains .
     That 's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks .
     `` I think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Einhorn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> .
     Growth stocks may be as big as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> or medium-sized such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circuit City Stores</ENAMEX> , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> a year , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say .
     `` The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Growth and Income Fund</ENAMEX> .
     Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weeks</TIMEX> ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading .
     This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Calverley</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Bank</ENAMEX> , of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1969-72</TIMEX> period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> flocked to the shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with proven earnings records , which became known as the `` nifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> . ''
     And they will again , say money-manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of the growth-stock theme .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabanne Smith</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of a money management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> bearing his name , predicts that investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> using computers to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with earnings `` momentum '' will climb on the growth-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bandwagon</ENAMEX> as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further .
     He also thinks foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices . `` We 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> recommends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cypress Semiconductor</ENAMEX> that is currently showing a robust <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63 %</NUMEX> earnings growth rate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Sloan</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Siebel Capital Management</ENAMEX> , likes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wellman Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that recycles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastic</ENAMEX> into synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fibers</ENAMEX> for carpeting .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloan</ENAMEX> praises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> as recession resistant and notes that it has an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> earnings growth rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</NUMEX> a year over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wellman</ENAMEX> stock closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 3\/8</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloan</ENAMEX> thinks that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> it could hit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> .
     Others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmine Grigoli</ENAMEX> , chief market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , who still says , `` We expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> average -LCB- to be at -RCB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1990</TIMEX> , '' nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime .
     He recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CPC International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reebok International</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Limited Inc</ENAMEX> .
     All have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">fiveyear</TIMEX> earnings growth rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> a year .
     Some money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle .
     `` One of the stories of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> sensitive to the economy , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banc One Asset Management</ENAMEX> , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . ''
     He recently trimmed his portfolio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum Chemical</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment</ENAMEX> .
     He is putting money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dress Barn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circuit City Stores</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bruno 's</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> .
     Big cyclical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are using `` all the tricks they can to stabilize earnings , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloan </ENAMEX>.
     He cites <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> earnings decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , and which last week announced a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> buy-back of its shares .
     `` What they are telling you is that they do n't have the ability to generate higher returns internally , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloan </ENAMEX>.
     `` When they are buying back stock at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times earnings , they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below '' returns on the stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> says it considers its shares a good investment .
     But not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> or money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals .
     Growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einhorn</ENAMEX> , for one , subscribes to that scenario .
     He suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> think about buying cyclical shares in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weeks ahead</TIMEX> , as well as growth issues .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     Stock prices finished about unchanged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in quiet expiration trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> anticipated a volatile session due to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks .
     But there were fewer price swings than expected .
     Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     But block trading desks and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> made a concerted effort to meet the imbalances with stock to sell , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said .
     As a result , the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted in narrow ranges in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final hour</TIMEX> of trading , and closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.94</NUMEX> higher to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2689.14</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164,830,000</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Advancers</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> lagged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">decliners</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">662</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">829</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , the industrial average gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119.88</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> , the biggest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> point advance ever and a better than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> rebound from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX> point loss the industrial average logged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     Broader market averages were little changed in the latest session .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's</ENAMEX> 500-Stock Index gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347.16</NUMEX> , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">325.50</NUMEX> , and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192.12</NUMEX> .
     Most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's surge in the industrial average came on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , when the average rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</NUMEX> points as market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> snapped up blue-chip issues and shunned the broad market .
     That contrast was reflected in the smaller weekly percentage gains recorded by the broader averages .
     The S&P 500 rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> , the Dow Jones Equity Market index gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7 %</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite index added <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</NUMEX> .
     The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32.71</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1230.80</NUMEX> amid renewed weakness in the airline sector .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> skidded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168 1\/2</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2 million</NUMEX> shares .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40 %</NUMEX> .
     The latest drop followed a decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> , which had supported the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share buy-out offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> from a labor-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , not to participate in any revised bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 7\/8</NUMEX> .
     While most other airline issues took their cue from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1\/4</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</NUMEX> shares amid speculation about a possible takeover proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> reported that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>, who had pursued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> before dropping his bid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , has acquired a stake of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3 %</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arbs</ENAMEX> may recoup some of their paper losses if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal gets patched up again , as they did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Occidental Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> rescued them with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cities Service</ENAMEX> .
     In the meantime , the question faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> is : What is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock worth ?
     The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the stock is worth somewhere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 135 and $ 150</NUMEX> a share .
     That 's based on a multiple of anywhere <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 8.5 to 10</NUMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 13</NUMEX> times earnings .
     That 's because airline earnings , like those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy .
     That analysis matches up with stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> solely on the basis of earnings .
     So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can put together a bid `` in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225</NUMEX> area , '' but that it could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three to four months</TIMEX> to close .
     At that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock should trade closer to
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , having accepted a bid of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX> a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> goes back to running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for a while and lets things return to normal .
     By that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three to four months</TIMEX> , even though the eventual price might be higher .
     Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> have been attempting a buy-out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two years</TIMEX> , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> compensation by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> , and to commit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> from their retirement funds .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , they also persuaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> to join them .
     However , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are n't likely to lend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the almost $ 5 billion</NUMEX> that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> in cash put up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in the leveraged takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA Corp.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal .
     That way , they figure , someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> lost theirs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     That leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> still in need of cash totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1 billion</NUMEX> -- far more than either they or the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obstacle to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> who have sought airline ownership <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> have insisted they , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , must have control .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking .
     But it is n't clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> dissatisfied .
     In advising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> on the various bids for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , starting with one for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240</NUMEX> a share from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>, the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> came up with a wide range of potential values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions .
     Using the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA</ENAMEX> takeover as a benchmark , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 14</TIMEX> estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> was worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 to $ 344</NUMEX> a share based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ending last June 30</TIMEX> , but <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 235 to $ 266</NUMEX> based on a management estimate of results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> 's estimates had been higher before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> supplied a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> projection .
     Using estimates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's value at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 248 to $ 287</NUMEX> a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 237 to $ 275</NUMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reaches a settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> similar to one at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA </ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 98 to $ 121</NUMEX> under an adverse labor settlement , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 229 to $ 270</NUMEX> under a pilot contract imposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> following a strike .
     And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> assets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 253 to $ 303</NUMEX> a share .
     Unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> .
     The deal has , as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> puts it , `` so many moving parts .
     I do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . ''
     In addition to the need for another cash equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , the other moving parts include : the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">rivals</ENAMEX> who helped scuttle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' deal ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt .
     In the meantime , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arbs</ENAMEX> are bleeding .
     Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> estimate that takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock and options equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 6.5 million</NUMEX> shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</NUMEX> of the total outstanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gallagher </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phoenix Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , estimates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arbs</ENAMEX> paid an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 280</NUMEX> a share for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> positions .
     That would indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arbs</ENAMEX> have paper losses on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> alone totalling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 725 million</NUMEX> .

     Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> has attracted offers for some of its advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> , with potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">suitors</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX> , but has rejected them , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> about buying its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , but was turned down by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
     More recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> inquired about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's smaller communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- identified as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rowland</ENAMEX> public relations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> by several industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> -- but again was rebuffed , they said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Geier Jr.</ENAMEX> , made the pitches in visits to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saatchi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said .

     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> has received several inquiries from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> interested in acquiring its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell-Mithun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rowland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     He added , `` We have no intention of selling either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> declined comment .
     The offers come as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is struggling through the most troubled period in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">19-year</TIMEX> history .
     Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southeastern Asset Management</ENAMEX> , has said it 's been approached by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties</ENAMEX> regarding a possible restructuring .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak .
     In the midst of the current turmoil , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .
     It named a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMS International</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis-Dreyfus</ENAMEX> .
     It rebuffed an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles </ENAMEX>, would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's troubles have only whipped up interest among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's major agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX> -- would be difficult for any ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> are quite attractive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX> , for example , has had big problems at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , but offers strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in other areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     That would would make it appealing to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> that already has a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> presence .
     -LRB- While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> . -RRB-

     He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> made the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> addition ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> 's congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> created the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> .
     Both of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's public faces have been on view <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few weeks</TIMEX> while he was under consideration to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Lederberg</ENAMEX> as head of the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institution</ENAMEX> .

     Insofar as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> has a special interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NIH</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> that receive its funding , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> were no doubt discomfited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> , whose behavior reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltimore</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCarthy</ENAMEX> era .
     This well may be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rockefeller University</ENAMEX> has brushed up publicly against the intimidations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> common in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> science .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> is n't their concern or that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> could have somehow placated a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> it is also about power .
     In a media-linked world , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> may earn wide praise and even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Nobels</ENAMEX> for their work , but they also attract the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> -- or the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX> -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .

     They 'd determine where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> could store their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , and they 'd regulate the storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     The initial costs are said to be in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> a year range , but that 's only the beginning .
     New entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes .
     Quack .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> claims that its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air</ENAMEX> bill will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Evans</ENAMEX> estimates that the costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will actually be in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion</NUMEX> a year range .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways .
     For example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     So instead of building more efficient modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> stick scrubbers on the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology .
     The bill also imposes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> auto-emissions standards on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> nationwide , as if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> registered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Big Sky</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Montana</ENAMEX> , needed to be as clean as one driven in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of the nationwide standards say the cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500</NUMEX> per car .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that estimate is low .
     Quack .
     Nobody knows how many <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans With Disabilities Act</ENAMEX> will cost , because nobody knows what the bill entails .
     It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> will write the real bill as suits roll through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> will benefit .
     Private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , and ultimately their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , will end up footing the huge bill .
     The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> era non-duck <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions .
     All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> , some of whom worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> to lift this burden from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> .
     Running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> .
     In fact , during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's campaign , the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> constantly heard Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> tout his accomplishments as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Task Force on Regulatory Relief</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Government</ENAMEX> continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> declared when he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the task <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">force</ENAMEX> .
     But with the impending passage of these new programs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will surely be sending many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , the number of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> was down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 103,000</NUMEX> .
     Then it turned up , and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> estimate the number will be up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 109,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> presidency .
     We would have thought by now , though , that there was a significant core of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy .
     It is merely the most obvious .
     What is even more ironic is that all over the world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire .
     But while they are unloading these burdens , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> is close to creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more big ones .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> ought to be setting aside some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">buckshot</ENAMEX> for the non-duck <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> .
