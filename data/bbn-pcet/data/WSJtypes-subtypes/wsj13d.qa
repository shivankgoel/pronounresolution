     At a private dinner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Joseph</ENAMEX> delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America </ENAMEX>.
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> conceded the junk market was in disarray , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the discussion .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> -- the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter</ENAMEX> of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> risked losing its highly lucrative junk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> .
     The dinner was a stark confirmation that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the worst year ever</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> junk market .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> alike say the current turmoil could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> to resolve .
     Amid the market disorder , even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , is pulling in its horns .
     Although the big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> still dominates the junk market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     For many money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past four months</TIMEX> have been humiliating .
     `` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> before it 's over , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Bachmann</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , a credit rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the end of last year</TIMEX> , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities .
     The junk market , which mushroomed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of the decade</TIMEX> , has been declining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments .
     The fragile market received its biggest jolt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> , which created its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 billion</NUMEX> in junk financing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> department store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> up for sale .
     At that point , the junk market went into a tailspin as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> disappeared and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> tried to sell .
     In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> says his dinner discussion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> acknowledged problems for junk .
     `` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says .
     `` Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past couple years</TIMEX> , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . ''
     What has jolted many junk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds .
     Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs .
     At closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deltec Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> , junk bond money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy K. Minella</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah H. Strasser</ENAMEX> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , while new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> have n't materialized to replace them .
     Wall Street securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> of junk bonds because of trading losses , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deltec</ENAMEX> said in a recent , grim report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Mutual funds have also been net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deltec</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kroger Co.</ENAMEX> ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress .
     And , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deltec</ENAMEX> said , buying has been severely reduced because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loans</ENAMEX> have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .
     `` In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loans</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> of high yield holdings throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deltec</ENAMEX> said .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strasser</ENAMEX> say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> and the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> in junk bonds , has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> because of falling junk prices .
     `` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Gregoire </ENAMEX>, a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     `` I have no reason to think things will get worse , but this market has a knack for surprising us .
     This market teaches us to be humble . ''
     The junk market 's `` yield <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hogs</ENAMEX> are learning a real painful lesson , '' he says .
     Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Reese </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</NUMEX> investment-grade public bond portfolio .
     `` But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse .
     And the risks are n't appropriate for us , '' he says .
     The big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> , owns <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $ 150 million</NUMEX> of publicly sold junk bonds .
     The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">this year</TIMEX> , probably will persist , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Asquith </ENAMEX>, associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Sloan School of Management</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asquith </ENAMEX>, whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> , says <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings .
     His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asquith</ENAMEX> says , is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&P</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years of 1984 through 1986</TIMEX> .
     These bonds , now rated single-D , include junk offerings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AP Industries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Savings</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Texas Savings Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gilbraltar Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resorts International Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vyquest Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford Cornell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Anderson Graduate School of Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doomsayers</ENAMEX> say . ''
     Despite the junk market 's problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> that its Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> have n't found .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three weeks</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> of new junk bonds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Uniroyal Chemical</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Air</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duff & Phelps</ENAMEX> .
     Still , the list of troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> bond offerings dwarfs that of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> on Wall Street , as does its successful offerings .
     Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>-underwritten issues include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resorts International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillette Holdings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Electric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> .
     `` Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Holland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste .

     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> , who owns an art porcelain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , sipped her luncheon cocktail , she reeled off the names of a few pals -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Ferguson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kluge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Petrie</ENAMEX> .
     Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Ritz</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` my day <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">diamond</ENAMEX> , darling '' -RRB- , she told her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX> that she is on the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">board</ENAMEX> '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">Vatican Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rome</ENAMEX> .
     As it turns out , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">board</ENAMEX> has a lot of important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winton Blount</ENAMEX> -LRB- former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postmaster general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gaisman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of auto-strop razor -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Murphy</ENAMEX> -LRB- an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     But Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boehm</ENAMEX> did n't mention any of them .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> has a way with names , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Revson</ENAMEX> , a gossip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> -LRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Revson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Revlon</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Like which are droppable and which are not .
     With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fall social season</TIMEX> well under way , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">name-droppers</ENAMEX> are out in force , trying to impress their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">betters</ENAMEX> and sometimes put down their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lessers</ENAMEX> .
     But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> , name-drops ; and a surprising number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> who claims he lived next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartoonist</ENAMEX> who did the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Katzenjammer Kids</ENAMEX> .

     `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Freudenberger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychoanalyst</ENAMEX> , with a high-powered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> .
     `` It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society ... .
     It provides some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . ''
     Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Long Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> in the theater district <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the other day</TIMEX> who swore to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> that she once met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza Minnelli</ENAMEX> .
     `` I was having a drink in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sardi 's</ENAMEX> , when all of a sudden I saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's backside coming up the steps on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">floor</ENAMEX> and she was wearing sequined slacks .
     I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> and sure enough , it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX> .
     So I said , ` Hello . '
     And she said , ` Hello . '
     Can you imagine ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX> said hello to me . ''
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse .
     `` They ca n't help talking about the big important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they know , even if they do n't really know them , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freudenberger</ENAMEX> .

     `` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and society , '' he says .

     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">droppers</ENAMEX> do n't flaunt only their friendships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trumps</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke Astor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georgette Mosbacher</ENAMEX> .

     Press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and public-relations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> are notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">name-droppers</ENAMEX> .
     And some even do it with malice aforethought .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Len Kessler</ENAMEX> , a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publicist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , sometimes uses it to get the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who try to avoid him .
     He says that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Dorfman</ENAMEX> , a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorfman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> saying that he has an important story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meshulam Riklis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> .

     `` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kessler</ENAMEX> says .
     There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name-dropping .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffry Thal</ENAMEX> , a publicity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lantz Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropper</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fake</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fraud</ENAMEX> .

     That 's because they only drop `` mere names , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill </ENAMEX>.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">SMYRNA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga.</ENAMEX> --
     The auto-dealer strip in this booming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">suburb</ENAMEX> runs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">nearly five miles</NUMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> , stretching from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Perimeter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> that circles <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> to the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Chicken</ENAMEX> , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">landmark</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Twenty years ago</TIMEX> , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealerships</ENAMEX> were here .
     Now there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> .
     Alongside such long-familiar names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> are nameplates that did n't exist until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acura</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sterling</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai</ENAMEX> .
     Under construction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">strip</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">24th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">showroom</ENAMEX> , the future <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> , a luxury marque launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">just two months ago</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The 1980s</TIMEX> have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> , in everything from phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">colas</ENAMEX> .
     And especially , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">strip</ENAMEX> attests , in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> can choose among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">572</NUMEX> different models of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 408</NUMEX> when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> began , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Automotive News</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publication</ENAMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> from defecting to one of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">makes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">block</ENAMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm MacDougall</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . ''
     He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will simply ignore new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> that lack a well-defined image .
     `` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . ''
     He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's quality image .
     He applauds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> for creating separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> for their new luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">lines</ENAMEX> .
     Some auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks .
     `` There 's more noise out there , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent P. Barabba</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of market research and planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">wheels</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeanene Page</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">North Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> , likes the broader selection .
     She wants something big , and already has looked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">New Yorker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Town Car</ENAMEX> .
     Now , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">55-year-old</TIMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopper</ENAMEX> is zeroing in on a full-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">van</ENAMEX> , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> and pull a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boat</ENAMEX> at the same time .
     `` That seems to be what all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are using to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandkids</ENAMEX> to the lake , '' she says .
     Market segmentation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred P. Sloan Jr.</ENAMEX> conceived the idea <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">50 years ago</TIMEX> .
     The legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> declared that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would make `` a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> for every purse and purpose . ''
     Now there are many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> for every purse and purpose .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just four years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> divided the combined car and truck market into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> segments .
     Today , they identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> distinct segments for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 11</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> .
     The number of makes has mushroomed because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is the world 's biggest and richest market for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">automobiles</ENAMEX> ; virtually every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> wants to sell here .
     For every brand like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> that has been squeezed out , others such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Isuzu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daihatsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> have come in .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Geo</ENAMEX> marque <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> made in partnership with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's long-awaited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Saturn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> will make their debut .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> nameplate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>-made touring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     But slow sales forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to kill the brand just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> have so many choices , brand loyalty is much harder to maintain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' survey found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 %</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> tend to switch brands .
     For the survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Roper Organization</ENAMEX> each asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> about their buying habits .
     Which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> favor most <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> ?
     It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under age 30</TIMEX> like sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">convertibles</ENAMEX> and imports far more than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> do .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under 30</TIMEX> would prefer to buy a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 16 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">30</TIMEX> and over , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey .
     Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> prefer luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> by a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> margin -- even though older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     Perhaps most striking , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18 to 44</TIMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     That 's true of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> headed by someone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">60 or older</TIMEX> .
     Generally , imports appeal most to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young .
     `` For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> , buying a domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> is a totally foreign experience , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Cedergren</ENAMEX> , auto-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.D. Power & Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Agoura Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX>
     Such preferences persist even though many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> believe differences between imported and domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> are diminishing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 58 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> believe that foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> get better gas mileage than domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey found , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 46 %</NUMEX> give foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> higher quality ratings , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     On the other hand , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 42 %</NUMEX> say foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> are less comfortable than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are to brand switching .
     `` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mignanelli</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     But out on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Negas</ENAMEX> sees it differently .
     `` The competition is so intense that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> 's loyalty to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ed Voyles Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealerships</ENAMEX> to locate on the strip .
     Thus the very fickleness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them .
     The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cobb Parkway</ENAMEX> strip .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ed Voyles Olds</ENAMEX> recently
     established a special section in the service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">less than a year old</TIMEX> , so they get quicker service .
     Just down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chris Volvo</ENAMEX> invites serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> to test-drive a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> to any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> along the strip , and compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> side-by-side .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> , too , are stretching further to lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , ignoring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's long-held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> ' safety features .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> may be on to something .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 60 %</NUMEX> of the survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 50 %</NUMEX> felt the same way about air bags .
     Both features appealed most to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under 45</TIMEX> .
     In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal .
     But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Grand Prix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> , even though it expects to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> equipped with that option .
     The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 190 billion</NUMEX> on new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1 %</NUMEX> of that market exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid Co.</ENAMEX> 's sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.86 billion</NUMEX> .
     `` Even if it 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 %</NUMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barabba</ENAMEX> , `` would you throw away sales the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> ? ''

     It 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> crime saga worthy of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erle Stanley Gardner</ENAMEX> title : <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Carlson</ENAMEX> awoke <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> to find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> holes in his front yard where his prized miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cycads</ENAMEX> , once stood .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Days later</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> returned and dug out more , this time adding insult to injury .
     `` The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time , '' he says , `` they left the shovel . ''
     No garden-variety crime , <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palm-tree</ENAMEX> rustling is sprouting up all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southern California</ENAMEX> , bringing big bucks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crooks</ENAMEX> who know their botany .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Cycads</ENAMEX> , the most popular of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Sago Palm</ENAMEX> , are doll-sized versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's famous long-necked <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Sago</ENAMEX> is relatively rare and grows <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">only a couple of inches</NUMEX> a year , it 's a pricey lawn decoration : A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two-foot</NUMEX> tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Sago</ENAMEX> can retail for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> , and taller ones often fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,000</NUMEX> or more .
     `` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loran Whitelock</ENAMEX> , a research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> specializing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cycads</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Los Angeles State and County Arboretum</ENAMEX> .

     `` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> suspect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> , who dig up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in the dead of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> , are selling them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">nurseries</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landscapers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Sago</ENAMEX> has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts , apparently giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rustlers</ENAMEX> a ready market for their filched <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fronds</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Thieves</ENAMEX> are going to find `` anybody who has enough bucks to plant these things in their front yard , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morrissey</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> with the police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Garden Grove</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> such thefts have been reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past several weeks</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> is advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> to plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Sagos</ENAMEX> , if they must , in the back yard and telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">nurseries</ENAMEX> to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off .
     But for those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> who want exotic gardens out front where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> can appreciate them , there 's always <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Smith</ENAMEX> 's approach .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> or more stocks .
     The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits .
     It 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market .

     The suit seeks unspecified damages .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities .
     The derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barron 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> that focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's problems .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video .
     The move also helps the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business .
     While the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium .
     `` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Niles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pioneer</ENAMEX> in high-definition programming .
     He notes that industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition .
     And only a handful of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are engaged in high-definition software development .
     It 's estimated that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just about 250 hours</TIMEX> of HD programming is currently available for airing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> says its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">CCD</ENAMEX> HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">programmers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broadcasters</ENAMEX> to convert movies and television programs shot in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">35mm</NUMEX> motion-picture film into high-definition video .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers .
     Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs .
     It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm G. Saull</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the film and video <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">department</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rochester Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
     The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joerg D. Agin </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> .
     A similar machine already on the market , made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rank Sintel Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rank Organisation</ENAMEX> , costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500,000</NUMEX> .
     And the potential market is tremendous , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say .
     If HDTV takes off in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , there will be demand for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 4,000 to 5,000</NUMEX> HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines .
     Demand will come first from programming production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and then from television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> .
     `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. Stumpf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> - engineering and development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Universal City Studios</ENAMEX> .
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niles</ENAMEX> , the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> , contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> 's move is `` a sound marketing decision .
     They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . ''
     Indeed , the stakes are high .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 150 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next two decades</TIMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 400 billion</NUMEX> expected to go for related products .
     HDTVs break down images into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,100</NUMEX> lines , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">525</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail .
     And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen .
     But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> estimate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">another five to 10 years</TIMEX> , and will probably retail for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3,000</NUMEX> each in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's dollars .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say they wo n't be quickly embraced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> because of the high price .
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> could n't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> .

     Yet another political scandal is racking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     And as it unfolds , it 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> society .
     Already , ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Liberal Democratic Party</ENAMEX> demands that opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> testify under oath in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> have stalled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> budget committee session and forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> to plan a special <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-day</TIMEX> investigation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> .
     But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> and those who favor leaving well enough alone .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> is that kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shigezo Hayasaka</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kingmaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kakuei Tanaka</ENAMEX> and now an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . ''
     This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pachinko</ENAMEX> , a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pinball</ENAMEX> , is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's favorite form of legal gambling .
     The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Recruit Co .</ENAMEX> influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     But the implications could be great .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pachinko</ENAMEX> is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's underworld and regularly at the top of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> lists of tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaders</ENAMEX> .
     Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe .
     Also , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 %</NUMEX> of pachinko parlor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> , many of whom maintain close ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North or South Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> , and donations by such foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are illegal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     To many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pachinko</ENAMEX> is benign or enticingly unsavory .
     Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> and narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">alleys</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Devotees</ENAMEX> pass <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with their thoughts .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.60</NUMEX> -RRB- for a handful of balls , <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pachinko</ENAMEX> is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> .
     But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 trillion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 92 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- , or nearly the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's vaunted automobile industry .
     And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> lists for tax evasion , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> estimate the real income could be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 20 trillion yen</NUMEX> .
     If that money were being taxed , it could bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> a badly needed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several trillion yen</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .
     Then , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pachinko</ENAMEX> was fielded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">parliament</ENAMEX> .
     The proposal split the industry in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , along the lines of national origin : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North Koreans</ENAMEX> oppose the plan while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Koreans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> accept it or are neutral .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , a conservative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> reported that a pachinko industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> donated money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Japan Socialist Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">JSP</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chosen Soren</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chosen Soren</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">JSP</ENAMEX> immediately denied the report .
     And at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> wanted to pursue the issue .
     But the press kept it alive ; as with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Recruit</ENAMEX> scandal , lists began circulating with names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had received money .
     Within a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weeks</TIMEX> , less-conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> had received much larger donations from pachinko <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> .
     So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> received amounted to bribes .
     Then the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> camps upped the ante : Reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chosen Soren</ENAMEX> had donated directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">JSP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were rapidly countered by statements that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> had long been donating directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">JSP</ENAMEX> admitted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about eight million yen</NUMEX> from the pachinko <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> , and charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">LDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with receiving <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">125 million yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 880,000</NUMEX> -RRB- and other opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">parties</ENAMEX> with taking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2.5 million yen</NUMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the chief cabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> announced that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> had received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five million yen</NUMEX> from the industry , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">450,000 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,175</NUMEX> -RRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshiki Kaifu</ENAMEX> .
     No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal .
     Direct donations from either of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> would be illegal because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are defined as foreign , but both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> deny making direct donations .
     They say it s possible some of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may be donating privately .
     The issue is further complicated because although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> represent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> , those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> were largely born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and many speak only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
     That they retain <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizenship</ENAMEX> and ties is a reflection of history -- their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were shipped in as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decades</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Korea</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> -- and the discrimination that still faces <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Koreans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> society .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> think it only natural that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would donate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> , the way many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> do , to win favor or support .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> admit to receiving some funding from abroad .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">LDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">JSP</ENAMEX> 's alleged donations , implying that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North Korean</ENAMEX> money would be more suspect than <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">North Korea</ENAMEX> is communist and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">ally</ENAMEX> .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert McDuffie</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">14</TIMEX> , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Macon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga</ENAMEX> .
     Unfortunately , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had tickets for a recital by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itzhak Perlman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the same night</TIMEX> , and she was adamant about his attending .
     `` I threw such a fit , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> , who had begun violin studies at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the age of six</TIMEX> .
     `` But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> started playing , I did n't give a damn about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> ... .
     Afterwards , I went home and practiced for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> . ''
     Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">six-foot , one-inch</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> made the right choice .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">At 31</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule .
     He 's currently in the midst of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-city <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> tour with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yehudi Menuhin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX> , with stops including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charleston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 25</TIMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sarasota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 28</TIMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 29</TIMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Later this season</TIMEX> he gives a recital at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX> , and appears as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soloist</ENAMEX> with several major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">orchestras</ENAMEX> .
     Yet Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> , he was part of a musical `` brat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX> '' -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of budding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virtuosos</ENAMEX> who studied at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Juilliard School</ENAMEX> with the noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedagogue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy DeLay</ENAMEX> .
     His violin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shlomo Mintz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protege</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX> who performed with major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">orchestras</ENAMEX> while still a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cho-Liang Lin</ENAMEX> , who joined the roster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ICM Artists Inc.</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the age of 18</TIMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg</ENAMEX> , who launched her career by winning the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Naumberg Competition</ENAMEX> .
     `` I thought I was over the hill at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">22</TIMEX> , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> , an outgoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with pale blue eyes and a light <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> drawl .
     `` But I was n't ready for a career at that time . ''
     Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> violin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henrik Schwarzenberger</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> who taught in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Macon</ENAMEX> public school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">system</ENAMEX> .
     `` He taught me how to play like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> , '' jokes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> .
     `` I did n't learn to count until I got to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Juilliard</ENAMEX> . ''
     After studies at that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">conservatory</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Pre-College Division</ENAMEX> with an assistant to the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Galamian</ENAMEX> , he switched at the college level to Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galamian</ENAMEX> 's longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> and , ultimately , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think I had to prove myself to her , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> .
     `` But she was always encouraging .
     She only put her foot down twice , '' he continues .
     `` In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">my freshman year</TIMEX> , my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> was known as a party <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> .
     She thought I was n't getting my practicing done . ''
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">violinist</ENAMEX> tells it , his grandmotherly looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> incident took place after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself .
     Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> requested that he come to her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">studio</ENAMEX> with a tape of the recital .
     `` We listened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chausson</ENAMEX> ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Poeme</ENAMEX> , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> note , that B-flat ?
     That 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . ''
     `` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> , '' he says , `` because she taught me how to listen .
     Now , when I play with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">orchestras</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> often compliment me on my intonation . ''
     It was also at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Juilliard</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> discovered his predilection for conservative , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Diamond</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Barber</ENAMEX> .
     After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> was invited to play the work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> , who was dying of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">violinist</ENAMEX> , who performed the work with a piano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accompanist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> .
     `` He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score .
     There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> movement ...
     The only time the violin has it is right at the end .
     It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it that way , kind of gigue-like .
     And he yelled out ` dolce ! dolce ! ' -LCB- ` sweet ! sweet ! ' -RCB- . ''
     `` So we did it over , '' he adds .
     `` I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow .
     If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra -LCB- volume -RCB- at that point , it makes the piece magical .
     I do n't know why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> never told anybody else .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX> 's recording it 's very biting . ''
     Since leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Juilliard</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
     His guest appearance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> soap opera `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Another World</ENAMEX> , '' scandalized musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elitists</ENAMEX> .
     By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schuman</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , '' which he recently recorded for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Angel\/EMI</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bernstein</ENAMEX> 's engaging `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interpreter</ENAMEX> of both works .
     Aided by the fluid playing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">St. Louis Symphony</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Slatkin</ENAMEX> 's direction , this `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Serenade</ENAMEX> '' really swings .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schuman</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente . ''
     But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soloist</ENAMEX> , brass and timpani .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Avery Fisher Hall</ENAMEX> here , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDuffie</ENAMEX> was heard recently with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menuhin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX> in more conventional fare -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruch</ENAMEX> 's overwrought `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Violin Concerto in G Minor</ENAMEX> .

     Are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> too deep in hock ?
     A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> think so , and , if they 're right , the whole economy as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spendthrifts</ENAMEX> among us could be hurt .
     A sudden , forced cutback by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> , who normally account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of economic activity , would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> ca n't readily take up the slack .
     And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worriers</ENAMEX> cite some worrisome trends .
     During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">almost seven-year-old</TIMEX> economic expansion , inflation-adjusted gross national product , disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 %</NUMEX> .
     And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income -- personal income after taxes -- has hit a high of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 18 1\/2 %</NUMEX> .
     However , these figures do n't seem to worry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas A. Durkin</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> .
     In a paper presented at the recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Business Economists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durkin</ENAMEX> comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences . ''
     He adds : `` We are now witnessing a slowdown which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while . ''
     But what about the debt burden ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durkin</ENAMEX> doubts that `` there is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems . ''
     And , `` more importantly , '' he says , `` the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters . ''
     The chart below shows why -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 23 , 1989</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income , though up a bit , has n't climbed steeply , and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed .
     Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durkin</ENAMEX> says .
     He notes that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing .
     In addition , he says , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . ''
     And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durkin</ENAMEX> says , `` much of the increase in debt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> is due to increasing credit use by higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , '' that is , `` those probably best able to handle it . ''
     Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45,000-$60,000</NUMEX> income range and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> with income <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above $ 60,000</NUMEX> . ''
     And much home-equity credit is used conservatively .
     `` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durkin</ENAMEX> says .
     So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 23 , 1989</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .
     In fact , the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1987</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Steinberg</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> , says .
     `` As a result , household debt appears to be stabilizing at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 63 %</NUMEX> of GNP . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> , credit cards in hand , are n't running amok through the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">malls</ENAMEX> -- or putting the economy at any great risk .

     `` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maidenform</ENAMEX> -RCB- is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">force</ENAMEX> to be reckoned with , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David S.

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three days later</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olga Co.</ENAMEX> , a competing intimate apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warnaco Inc</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as next year</TIMEX> , a Western government report says , unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit .
     According to the report , completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first seven months of this year</TIMEX> , the reserves would be wiped out either in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three months</TIMEX> of its imports .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 billion</NUMEX> of reserves <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> would cover just that much .
     The report by the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , which declines to be identified , concludes that `` a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 5 %</NUMEX> per annum . ''
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> customs figures , import growth has slowed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> , dropping to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> periods , compared with an average growth rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> .
     But before import growth slowed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's buying spree in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14 billion</NUMEX> level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> marked a drop from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of April</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.6 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1985</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.6 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous September</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> decline , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency .
     But this time , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> killings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 4</TIMEX> .
     Revenue from tourism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> is projected to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.2 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Because of this and the huge trade gap , the deficit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's current account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is expected to widen sharply from the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 billion</NUMEX> deficit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's current-account balance , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which are considered most likely .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> recorded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first seven months</TIMEX> , and the current-account deficit widens to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.1 billion</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> had a record deficit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.4 billion</NUMEX> .
     The other scenario assumes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beijing</ENAMEX> takes effective actions to curb imports in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming months</TIMEX> .
     In this case , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> would still finish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> with a current-account deficit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.7 billion</NUMEX> , based on projections that imports for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">this year</TIMEX> grow <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> and exports <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> were still on good terms with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> , it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit .
     But since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> led by international financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> have virtually suspended their new loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> .
     Even if borrowing resumes , commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> are n't expected to lend as much as before .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> become increasingly wary of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's deteriorating political and economic environment .
     On top of all this , foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991 to 1992</TIMEX> .
     With less capital coming in , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's balance of payments would suffer .
     The Western government report 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> scenario assumes a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> reduction in foreign borrowing and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> contraction in foreign direct investment .
     In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> , foreign borrowing is projected to grow <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> and investment to drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     But in either case , the report says , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves , which are used to finance the imbalance .
     In the first scenario , the reserves would be exhausted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , and in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> they would be wiped out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Brown</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">31,000 feet</NUMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> when both jets on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Falcon 20</ENAMEX> flamed out .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">18,000 feet</NUMEX> , he says , he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-pilot</ENAMEX> `` were looking for an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">interstate</ENAMEX> or a cornfield '' to land .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">13,000 feet</NUMEX> , the engines restarted .
     But knowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> skipped his stop in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> and set course to get his load -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> parcels -- to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> package-sorting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">hub</ENAMEX> on time .
     Had he been a little less gung-ho , `` I 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bar</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> says .
     But he flies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express Corp.</ENAMEX> , perhaps the closest thing in corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Green Berets</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long hours</TIMEX> and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock .
     Like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time .
     They are a tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> which , since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's founding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">16 years ago</TIMEX> , has had its way with its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry .
     That may soon change .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,048</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 961</NUMEX> acquired along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger International Inc.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> , will decide whether to elect the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Air Line Pilots Association</ENAMEX> as their bargaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agent</ENAMEX> .
     The election , which would bring the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , has pitted new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires</ENAMEX> against devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> .
     It has also rattled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's strongly anti-union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> , which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits .
     `` A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , sooner or later , has to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">adversary</ENAMEX> , and it has to have a victory , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick W. Smith</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , says with disdain .
     `` In our formula , we do n't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">losers</ENAMEX> except the competition . ''
     What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> .
     Under federal transportation law , a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> is attempting to reconcile the melding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's job classifications into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's .
     Depending on the outcome , the merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> may face union elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> among airplane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> , ramp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> and flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 10 %</NUMEX> of its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Unions</ENAMEX> would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard La Londe</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Ohio State University at Columbus</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .
     That culture , carefully crafted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> , leaves little , if any , room for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .
     Since founding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , the
     charismatic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> , who is still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">only 46 years old</TIMEX> , has fostered an ethos of combat .
     Flights are `` missions . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have , at times , been called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Ho Chi Minh</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guerrillas</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bravo Zulu</ENAMEX> award , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> accolade for a `` job well done , '' is bestowed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who surpass the call of duty .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Competitors</ENAMEX> are known as the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enemy</ENAMEX> . ''
     To reinforce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ' dedication , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> pays well .
     He also lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats .
     He gives pep talks in periodic `` family briefings '' beamed internationally on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FXTV</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's own television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     And , with many of his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> 's damn-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">torpedoes</ENAMEX> attitude has caught on .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cleveland</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> who earned a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Bravo Zulu</ENAMEX> for figuring out how to get a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,100</NUMEX>-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a.m.</TIMEX> , considers himself far more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> .
     `` We do n't just hand the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> the package .
     That 's just the beginning , '' he says .
     `` In essence , we run the show . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sanders</ENAMEX> , a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> , bristles at the mere suggestion that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> might tamper with his flight schedule .
     `` This is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     `` Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work . ''
     Such attitudes have given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> extraordinarily lean .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> deliberately understaffs , stretching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ' schedules to the limit .
     But though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couriers</ENAMEX> work as many as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 hours</TIMEX> a week during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">autumn</TIMEX> rush , they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pilots</ENAMEX> , as well , routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows .
     The operational freedom has also given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> a leg up on archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Parcel Service Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">United Brotherhood of Teamsters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UPS</ENAMEX> wo n't discuss its labor practices , but , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleveland </ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> , and others , union work rules prohibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> from doing more than carrying packages between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> .
     Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are n't permitted to load their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">depot</ENAMEX> , say these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couriers</ENAMEX> , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late .
     Labor problems are the last thing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> needs right <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> acquisition has brought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> a long way toward becoming the global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> it wants to be , it also has brought problems .
     It more than doubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's long-term debt to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> , thrust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas .
     It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-empty on certain routes .
     On routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">South America</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had no backup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jets</ENAMEX> to ensure delivery when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> were grounded .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , business suffered as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> bought several local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , only to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> quit .
     These and other problems squeezed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's profit margins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 13 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the decade</TIMEX> .
     Earnings have plummeted , too , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each of the past three quarters</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31</TIMEX> , profit fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">58 cents</NUMEX> a share , mostly because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> merger , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     Since trading as low as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42.25</NUMEX> a share in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's shares have rallied <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as $ 57.87</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     They closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.25</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     There 's a certain irony in the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> faces its first union problems as a result of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> purchase .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> itself was founded by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of gungho <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airmen</ENAMEX> who had airlifted supplies `` over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Hump</ENAMEX> '' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> modeled his fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations .
     But from early on , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> unionized , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's never have .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's earnings to improve again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> should begin benefiting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's extra flights , back-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> and landing rights .
     Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> to continue crimping profits .
     For now , the union issue is the most nettlesome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> problems , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> believes .
     Although encouraging dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> does n't countenance what he considers insubordination .
     When a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">hangar</ENAMEX> and dressed them down for challenging his authority .
     He then made most of the changes , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> say .
     That sort of approach , however , has n't worked since the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> .
     Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , who had battled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> over givebacks , were union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the merger , when most of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> were automatically decertified .
     Soon after the merger , moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time , without cause or notice .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> refused , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> retracted it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> angered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , too .
     In his haste to seal the deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last August</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> ignored a promise that he had made to his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> : that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fliers</ENAMEX> acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> is trying hard to allay the anger .
     And even some pro-union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> say his charisma and popularity among the many former military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fliers</ENAMEX> could be tough to beat .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Smith</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.X. Gollich</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX>-turned-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and other top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Recently , they have appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every few weeks</TIMEX> in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> video , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> defended his agreement to merge the pilot-seniority lists .
     He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX> had insisted that the merger talks move quickly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Regulators</ENAMEX> , as well , might have quashed the deal if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had n't been protected , he said .
     Furthermore , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> added , `` our contract with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice .
     It does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change . ''
     Already , the fight has been costly .
     The seniority-list controversy , along with the job-classification dispute , has been turned over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is operating with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and seniority lists , and that is costing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> `` a big number , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Barksdale</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> .
     The issue has also cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> a lot of good will among its old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> .
     `` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Queenan</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">DC-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">14-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> .
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Poag</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">727</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> and past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the company-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Flight Advisory Board</ENAMEX> : `` They 've made all these magnanimous gestures to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Flying Tiger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> , and for us , nothing . ''
     Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote .
     A large majority of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">961</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fliers</ENAMEX> support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , according to a union study .
     But though most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,087</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> are believed opposed , it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> has been eroded .
     The fight has turned ugly and , among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> at least , has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> worked so hard to build .
     Anti-union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> have held ballot-burning parties .
     Some younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> say they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> while flying across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     And for now , at least , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competition</ENAMEX> is n't the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enemy</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barney Barnhardt</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">727</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the pro-union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> , said he has received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> District
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcee
     Hastings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> impeachment articles , removing the
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">53-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> from his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 89,500</NUMEX>-a-year , lifetime job .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> was impeached and removed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> on charges of which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> had acquitted him .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> was found not guilty of accepting a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150,000</NUMEX> bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> convicted him .
     He was only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial .
     With no floor debate , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> voted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> to convict Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> votes more than needed .
     Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     He was found not guilty of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> did n't vote on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> lesser charges .
     Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> had been acquitted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> handling the prosecution in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> .
     Instead , they argued that impeachment aims to protect public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">institutions</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have abused their positions of trust , irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> faced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and sat impassively during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> roll-call votes , then quickly left the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chamber</ENAMEX> .
     In an impromptu news conference on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol</ENAMEX> steps , he denounced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> ' action .
     `` Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forefathers</ENAMEX> ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> said .
     For the future , he said he would run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> was appointed to the federal bench by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> and was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the few black federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     While he packed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">gallery</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> during some of the impeachment trial , most civil rights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> kept their distance from his case .

     When last we left him , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Mancuso</ENAMEX> had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> political scandal , and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Favorite Son</ENAMEX> . ''
     What next for the crusty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> with the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> ?
     A spinoff series , of course .
     There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup :
     a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nun</ENAMEX> raising some lovable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orphans</ENAMEX> .
     A den <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> raising some lovable teen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> .
     A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX> .
     In that context , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Loggia</ENAMEX> 's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> seems a better franchise for a series than most .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Week</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week</TIMEX> on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 p.m . ET</TIMEX> -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first few weeks</TIMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack of imagination , or both .
     The opening show featured a secretary of defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate</ENAMEX> accused of womanizing -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tower</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> is found floating dead in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> 's pool , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> is called in to investigate .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , a young black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> claimed she had been raped by a white police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tawana Brawley</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> -LRB- a la <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Rocky Flats</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> : a blond bombshell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randi Brazen</ENAMEX> -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fredric Lehne</ENAMEX> -RRB- , another blonde <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bombshell</ENAMEX> who 's also an idealistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsay Frost</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and a forensics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Siebert</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists :
     The usual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime .
     -LRB- In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's rape case , for example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> turns out to have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of incest , and the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villains</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who exploit the case . -RRB-
     Most of all though , the show is redeemed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> .
     What makes the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> .
     He was n't protecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Freedom Marchers</ENAMEX> ; he was tailing them as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subversives</ENAMEX> .
     This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario that thrills his young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kid</ENAMEX> , you 've been reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Classic Comics</ENAMEX> too long , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> says .
     `` Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1964</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chauffeurs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Edgar Hoover</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cleaned his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> . ''
     At the core of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loggia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> is his world-weary truculence .
     He describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> as `` Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> . ''
     He describes a drowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esther Williams</ENAMEX> . ''
     And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">linguine</ENAMEX> . ''
     Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX> , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Way .
     He 's the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who rescues trampled flags .
     If `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> '' has an intriguing central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> , it also has a major flaw :
     It 's wildly overwritten .
     Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Producers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Sohmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bleckner</ENAMEX> -LRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer\/producers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Solarz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Bello </ENAMEX>-RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point .
     To start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` What if the press gets a hold of this ? ''
     At least once an episode we see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX> marching around screaming slogans .
     At least once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> yells `` In here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> down :
     `` You are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> ... a hangover in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> suit ...
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . ''
     Finally , of course , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> gives in , but he 's still yelling : `` I find myself explaining anything to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Kennedy</ENAMEX> , you 'll be chasing stolen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Anchorage</ENAMEX> . ''
     In fact , throughout `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witnesses</ENAMEX> shout , scream , pontificate : `` ... a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> who try to tear down every decent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who raises his voice . ''
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> .
     `` You twist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's trust .
     You built your career on prejudice and hate .
     The scars will be here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> after the polls close . ''
     In each show , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> gets to unleash similar harangues :
     `` Where the hell are they gon na live when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like you turn the world into a big toxic waste <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dump</ENAMEX> ?
     You 're the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX> here ... and what you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . ''
     And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox . ''
     Now that 's advice the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> should take to heart .
     They have a series with a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it .
     Why , when a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> disappears , does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> trash her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> , tearing down drapes , smashing walls ?
     It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz .
     That 's not plot .
     That 's not character .
     That 's hyperventilating .
     There is a scene at the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first week</TIMEX> 's show where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mancuso</ENAMEX> attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> .
     Asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk , but he 's too choked up to get the words out .
     He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
     It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Loggia</ENAMEX> 's acting resonated in the silence .
     There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Mancuso FBI</ENAMEX> . ''
     If the show 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">White Plains</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that it had acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tana Production Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TRT Energy Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95.1 million</NUMEX> in cash , with the rest to be paid in shares of a new , non-voting issue of preferred stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tana</ENAMEX> , which holds properties in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> oil and gas fields in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , will provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> with mostly gas reserves .
     The fields contain recoverable reserves of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">435 billion cubic feet</NUMEX> of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">four million barrels</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> .
     `` This acquisition is another indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> 's commitment to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's reserve base , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Executive Officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James W. Kinnear</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> has also been attempting to sell oil properties .
     At least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> put <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">60 million barrels</NUMEX> of oil reserves on the block .
     They were either too small or uneconomic to maintain , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     Not all of those parcels have yet been sold .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tana</ENAMEX> before it completed those sales because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tana</ENAMEX> 's properties are high quality and near other fields <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> already owns , a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> , like many other oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> been focused on its brawl with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> and then on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl C. Icahn</ENAMEX> 's attempt to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> had sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Getty Oil Co .</ENAMEX>
     Eventually , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> , which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation , settled its fight with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> , who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , sold his stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> .
     Completion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> 's acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tana</ENAMEX> is subject to government approval under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act</ENAMEX> .
