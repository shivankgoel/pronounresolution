     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of the auction house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> , said its net loss for the seasonally slow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third quarter</TIMEX> narrowed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> on a leap in operating revenue .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reported a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> a share , compared with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Operating revenue surged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54 %</NUMEX> in the latest period to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42.9 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.7 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of its auction business is usually conducted in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second and fourth quarters</TIMEX> , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current quarter</TIMEX> having begun `` extremely well .

     West Texas Intermediate , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , seemed tethered again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Widely expected to open <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 to 15 cents</NUMEX> a barrel higher on the strength of statistics from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Petroleum Institute</ENAMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract managed to start the session <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only eight cents higher</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last hour</TIMEX> of the trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract took a tumble to end the session <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> lower at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.62</NUMEX> a barrel .
     And now that the price has fallen below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.65</NUMEX> , which many had said showed considerable resistance , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> figure there 's little to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions .
     With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> are wanting to sell this stuff , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Bolling</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edge Trading Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` And short-term , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> may have their way . ''
     The market quickly discounted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> inventory report showing a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">6.3 million barrel</NUMEX> decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> crude oil stocks as the legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Jerry</ENAMEX> .
     That storm hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Gulf Coast</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , closing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Louisiana Offshore Oil Port</ENAMEX> for a time and preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tankers</ENAMEX> from unloading .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next week</TIMEX> 's report could very well show an increase in crude inventories .
     Dismissing the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's numbers left <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> plenty of time to worry anew about the latest reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> production .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> survey of integrated oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">refiners</ENAMEX> , and oil industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> increased its production to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">22.2 million barrels</NUMEX> a day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Estimates suggest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> 's figure may be even higher .
     That level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter of the year</TIMEX> is generally the weakest and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> production does n't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that .
     Also , maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies .
     To top off the bearish factors affecting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's trading , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late October</TIMEX> weather , especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , continues to be very moderate , leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster .
     `` We are n't seeing any cold weather here , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolling</ENAMEX> said from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     In other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">GRAINS</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SOYBEANS</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Soybean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength .
     A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices .
     Wheat futures prices fell , however , at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">several million bushels</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> by commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Dennis </ENAMEX>.
     Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> trading company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C&amp;D Commodities</ENAMEX> , could be reached for comment .
     As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Freed</ENAMEX> , a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Soybean futures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery gained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.25 cents</NUMEX> a bushel to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.66</NUMEX> a bushel on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> corn futures added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.25 cents</NUMEX> a bushel to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4225</NUMEX> a bushel on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> .
     Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> are also supporting futures prices .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ships</ENAMEX> are arriving in the gulf and there is n't enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> in the pipeline , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katharina Zimmer</ENAMEX> , a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has purchased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">roughly eight million tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , and is expected to take delivery by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">COTTON</ENAMEX> :
     Futures prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract settled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">73.97 cents</NUMEX> a pound , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.59 cent</NUMEX> , but it rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 74.20 cents</NUMEX> .
     Several cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said that the move appeared to be mostly technical .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> who had sold contracts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier</TIMEX> , in hopes of buying them back at lower prices , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses .
     Floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> also said that the market could have been helped by rumors , which have been circulating for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two days</TIMEX> , about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cotton</ENAMEX> .
     The rumor , which has been neither confirmed nor denied , has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> buying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">125,000 to 200,000 bales</NUMEX> for near-term delivery .
     One floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said that if there were <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market .
     Another said that if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">buyer</ENAMEX> , it would be the earliest that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> had made purchases since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1979-80 crop year</TIMEX> , and thus would be a bullish sign .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> characterized the recent price action as a contest between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX> , who see higher prices ahead , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> , who are basically buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cotton</ENAMEX> toward the bottom of the current trading range , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 71 cents</NUMEX> , and selling it when the price climbs more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74 cents</NUMEX> .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract was able to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75.75 cents</NUMEX> .
     He also noted that stocks on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 1 , 1990</TIMEX> , are currently projected at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">3.3 million bales</NUMEX> , the smallest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">end-of-season</TIMEX> supply since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">COCOA</ENAMEX> :
     The modest sell-off , which started on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , continued .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract ended at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 999</NUMEX> a metric ton , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> .
     The market is drifting , at least partly , because of a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> information out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ghana</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">producers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Schwartz</ENAMEX> , a soft commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cargill Investors Services</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said the only report <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ghana</ENAMEX> has issued about the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> from the interior was for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">7,839 metric tons</NUMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 12</TIMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this time last year</TIMEX> , he noted , arrivals totaling <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">33,270 tons</NUMEX> had been announced .
     A similar situation apparently exists in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> with no figures released yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">55,000 tons</NUMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this time a year ago</TIMEX> .
     He said that if little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> actually has arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ports</ENAMEX> , shipping delays could result .
     This is the worry that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> , he said .
     There was also some fear that without <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> cocoa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere Sucre et Denrees</ENAMEX> , might not be able to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> against the contracts it had sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchant</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 200,000 tons</NUMEX> of old crop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> stored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands</ENAMEX> from an agreement it had negotiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cargill</ENAMEX> thinks that even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchant</ENAMEX> has a contract stating that it wo n't bring this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> to market until after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1991</TIMEX> , there is some evidence the contract has been modified .
     This modification , apparently , would permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchant</ENAMEX> to deliver this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> , if necessary , against existing short positions .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International Inc.</ENAMEX> said it has n't received any other offers to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> , and took another step toward completion of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> acquisition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMA Holdings Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMA</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , submitted a reduced bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> after it could n't finance its initial offer .
     Under the new offer , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMA</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.50</NUMEX> a share for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 million</NUMEX> shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 86 %</NUMEX> of the shares outstanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMA</ENAMEX> also will assume <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</NUMEX> in debt .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMI</ENAMEX> common closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23.625</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> , on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 1.8 million</NUMEX> .
     Earlier , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> said it had been approached again by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitors</ENAMEX> , whom it would n't identify but who had previously submitted bids for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> said that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that they do n't have any current intention of making a takeover bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> have approved what is , in effect , a draft of a solvency opinion on the acquisition , submitted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based investment banking and evaluation consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Houlian Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin Inc .</ENAMEX>
     A final opinion must be approved prior to the acceptance of tendered shares for payment under the offer , which was due to expire at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:01 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> downgraded the ratings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> 's senior and subordinated debt issues and those of its international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> .
     The downgrade anticipates completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMA Holdings</ENAMEX> acquisition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said .
     The ratings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said the acquisition should result in pretax losses from operations because of increases in interest expense and charges for depreciation and amortization , but that it expects the losses to be reduced through productivity gains and above average growth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> said the ratings anticipate a successful debt-reduction program and modest improvement in discretionary cash flow because of planned asset sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> changes affected the following issues :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International</ENAMEX> : Senior notes , sinking-fund debentures , Euromarket notes , Eurobonds , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> franc bonds , unsecured loan stock to Ba3 from Baa2 ; convertible subordinated debentures , notes , and sinking-fund debentures to B2 from Baa3 .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> agreed to continue production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-14</ENAMEX> and to provide more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 billion</NUMEX> for the Strategic Defense Initiative during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current fiscal year</TIMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few days</TIMEX> , provide a face-saving compromise for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> are still putting the finishing touches on the package , the final agreement could be announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     An announcement is more likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> , though .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">system</ENAMEX> , which already has cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 17 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga .</ENAMEX> -RRB- and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> have opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> cuts , stalling for almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> action on a number of big-ticket items in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's budget .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> voted to authorize <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> for SDI spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current fiscal year</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 3.1 billion</NUMEX> .
     Despite the widening gap between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sides</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> eventually followed the pattern set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous years</TIMEX> by opting to roughly split the difference .
     That would hold spending on the program at about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> 's level .
     The decision to keep the embattled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-14</ENAMEX> 's production line running for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least another year</TIMEX> is an important victory for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , and especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Aspin </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wis .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .

     The package `` provides a temporary , golden parachute for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> , '' according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> familiar with the closed-door bargaining .
     But as part of the overall agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> and its outspoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> 's budget .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> contend that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Navy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">F-14</ENAMEX> is too expensive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an era</TIMEX> of shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budgets .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">plane</ENAMEX> boasts a strong core of support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are intent on saving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late 1990s</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conferees</ENAMEX> also agreed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests to earmark a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 billion</NUMEX> for work on both mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">MX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Midgetman</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> , according to congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> nearly all of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</NUMEX> it wants for production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX> 's radar-eluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">B-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bombers</ENAMEX> , which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 530 million</NUMEX> apiece .
     The final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">B-2</ENAMEX> agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">bomber</ENAMEX> 's capabilities , but congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> said the accord wo n't include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> approves a cheaper , scaled-down version of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 billion</NUMEX> fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">B-2s</ENAMEX> envisioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .

     A round of futures-related program selling near the close sent the stock market lower in otherwise directionless trading .
     Nervousness that the market has n't seen the last of its recent volatility kept trading at a moderate pace , as did anticipation of a report on the economy 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> performance .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which plunged more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> points in early trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close , fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.94</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2653.28</NUMEX> in the latest session .
     The average drifted in a trading range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> points throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     The lower boundary was established just after the opening in a brief round of selling ; the upper boundary was set at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> as scattered bargain-hunting pushed prices higher .
     Buying interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> , which declared a stock split and a dividend boost , and certain other blue-chip issues gave the industrial average a better performance than broader indexes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> 500-Stock Index dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.20</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">342.50</NUMEX> ; the decline was the equivalent of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-point setback in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-stock average .
     The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320.94</NUMEX> and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.53</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189.52</NUMEX> .
     But advancing issues topped decliners by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">784 to 700</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> despite the late sell programs , resulting from stock-index arbitrage .
     The programs occurred against the backdrop of a late pullback in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , which had held at slightly lower levels through most of the session amid optimism that another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder</ENAMEX> might surface .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said program activity was n't in evidence through most of the session , however , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155,650,000</NUMEX> shares from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 238 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> as concerns about the potential for additional sharp swings in the market kept other trading in check .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink .
     Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second year</TIMEX> in a row , and its superefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> of everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity , modernize <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> and develop new products .
     `` The boom 's so huge , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsuru Saito</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sanwa Research Institute</ENAMEX> , `` it makes you think of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">Golden '60s</TIMEX> , '' when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> developed rapidly .
     The more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> and robots <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> add , the more they will be able to export , and the less their domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> will need to import .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canon Inc.</ENAMEX> , for example , sales are up nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> ; so , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of cameras and computer printers is doing what any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would do under the circumstances : It is increasing capital spending -- by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> .
     It is building , among other things , a new laser-beam-printer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> that can produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 150,000</NUMEX> printers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of them are to be exported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in smokestack industries wrestling with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> are raising capital spending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi Zosen Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipbuilder</ENAMEX> buried in debt just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> , will build a machinery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> expansion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">14 years</TIMEX> .
     So big is the capital-spending boom that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' outlays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> topped <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' domestic outlays by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended March 31</TIMEX> even though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's total output of goods and services is less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's .
     From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> expect record profits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fiscal year</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> interest rates , though up a bit recently , are still low .
     And in a business system where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> have few rights and expect only modest dividends , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can plow their profits back into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> and equipment .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> here are n't applauding .
     They fear that the boom may be too big for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's or anyone else 's good .
     `` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Courtis </ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deutsche Bank Group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">The Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to exercise caution in capital spending .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">MITI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> even though export restraints currently limit <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Not everyone is worried , however .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> -- and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- are puzzled by the warnings .
     The investment boom is mainly sparked , they say , by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply .
     Moreover , much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity .
     According to a survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,400</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Japan Development Bank</ENAMEX> , expanded capacity is the goal of just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.8 %</NUMEX> of the outlays ; for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> alone , the figure is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.2 %</NUMEX> of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.5 %</NUMEX> is to cut costs , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5 %</NUMEX> is for research and development , and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worriers</ENAMEX> remain unconvinced .
     With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world , they think that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more .
     And eventually , they contend , domestic demand will weaken , forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to emphasize exports again .
     `` If there 's a further drive to export , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuyuki Arai</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Japan Development Bank</ENAMEX> , `` that 'll be a problem . ''
     Even in the short run , the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend : <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , for example , are increasing their production capacity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> ; the additional production should , in part , replace imported <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> with locally manufactured ones .
     But although <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> increased their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto output by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">from January to September</TIMEX> compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier period</TIMEX> , their exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> will drop <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Nikko Research Center</ENAMEX> estimates .
     In contrast to previous economic booms , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are n't just trying to boost production .
     Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and , to some extent , to avoid direct combat with cheaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
     Others are replacing older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> with flexible assembly lines on which different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> can be turned out at once .
     So many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are investing in high-tech machinery that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fanuc Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a robot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , also had to build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     The buildup is `` making <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
     But whatever its effects on exports and imports , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's investment boom during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's marathon economy , growing at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , is now in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its 35th month</TIMEX> of expansion , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are betting that the boom will outlast the record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">57-month</TIMEX> expansion in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960s</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">29-inch</NUMEX> television sets and luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's domestic auto sales are up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> largely because its expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Cima</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Sylvia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Cefiro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> are in heavy demand .
     `` One <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> told me that if he had more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , he 'd sell them right away , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takuro Endo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     He adds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is trying to keep up with demand `` by overworking '' its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's sales are so brisk that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> grumble they have n't had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's encouragement of more leisure activity .
     With demand growing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in short supply , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> are spending heavily on automation .
     Among them are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipbuilders</ENAMEX> , which had halved their shipyard work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.</ENAMEX> , a medium-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shipbuilder</ENAMEX> , expects its sales to increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , largely because of rising demand for oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tankers</ENAMEX> .
     Once <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> steps up its investments , the whole industry follows .
     Because most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> put market share above profitability , to let a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> 's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat .
     The emphasis on market share is evident at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daikin Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of industrial air conditioners .
     Seeing new office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> sprout up and its sales soar , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daikin</ENAMEX> is building another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which will lift its production capacity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's market share to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> currently .
     Besides , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daikin</ENAMEX> 's major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> , `` are all adding production lines , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daikin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     `` Until now , we were trying to increase productivity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> we already had .
     But we ca n't produce enough anymore . ''
     The competition is even more heated in the auto industry , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are racing one another in a world-wide market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> aims to expand its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> share of the market to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> by spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 141 million</NUMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> that could make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 240,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> a year .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 247 million</NUMEX> buildup is increasing its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> capacity by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 317 million</NUMEX> on expansion .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> is still considering its options , but it boldly aims to double its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> domestic sales to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next four years</TIMEX> .
     Those who are n't worried about how <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't replacements for imports .
     Although imports account for less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> of beer sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asahi Breweries Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which has been gaining share with its popular dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> , plans to fend off <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> by pouring <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</NUMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> to brew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> .
     But new-product development will make <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> stronger , and big investments in `` domestic '' industries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> will make it even tougher for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> to crack the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> market .
     Moreover , much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have only limited foreign competition ; so , more investment practically assures more exports .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> , for example , is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 986 million</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> to build <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">four-megabit</NUMEX> dynamic random access memories , the next generation of computer chips .
     The product is n't widely used yet , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> , which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">one-megabit</NUMEX> DRAMs , believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> again .
     `` It 's important to gain leadership , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX> , are n't sitting still .
     After doubling production in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275 million</NUMEX> to build another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> that , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> , will be able to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">four-megabit</NUMEX> DRAMs a year .
     The new chip <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> `` wo n't be excessive investment , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hajime Sasaki</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> plans to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> exports when a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> starts up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     What if its sales weaken someday ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have a caveat competitor attitude .

     Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> .
     The clearance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> comes after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> of restricted access for the youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> to the only antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> yet cleared to treat the fatal disease .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> believed effective but lacking formal approval .
     The move will make the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> available free of charge for a time to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> have had access to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> approved the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> 's usage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1987</TIMEX> .

     As a result , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> have been unable to obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> and , for the few exceptions , insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> wo n't cover its cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6,400</NUMEX> a year .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel </ENAMEX>, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age seven</TIMEX> after her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> unsuccessfully pleaded for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> .
     `` I could get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glaser </ENAMEX>, who bears her infection without any symptoms .
     `` But my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> could n't , until she was too ill to take it .

     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> , healthy and symptom-free , currently takes no medication .
     The delay in getting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> has been blamed on a combination of factors .
     Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> have charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> 's maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burroughs Wellcome Co.</ENAMEX> with corporate inertia because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1 %</NUMEX> of the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX> has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">syrup form</ENAMEX> easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> to take .
     Still , all this comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nearly a year and a half</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Pizzo</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> offered evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> could reverse the ravages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills .
     Since then , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 50</NUMEX> pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have received the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> in his program .
     To some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> , the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> action is a poignant reminder of what might have been .
     `` My first reaction is I do n't understand why it 's taken so long .

     Similar sentiments were voiced on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> .
     `` While I 'm pleased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> is finally releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , it 's taken much too long to get to this point , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Weiss</ENAMEX> .

     `` Let 's not forget this is the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that has been profiteering with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2 years</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiss</ENAMEX> added .

     `` There 's no finger to be pointed , '' she said .
     `` The crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well , and to make sure other experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bristol-Myers Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">DDI</ENAMEX> , do n't follow the same frustrating course as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS dementia</ENAMEX> -- which gradually steals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's ability to speak , walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome .
     For some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">AZT</ENAMEX> has restored the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily .

     The offer is in limbo , however , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> has agreed to merge its cellular-phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth Corp .</ENAMEX>
