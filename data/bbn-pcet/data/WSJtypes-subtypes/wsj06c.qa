     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> have n't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> parried the question at a news conference here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> , saying only that `` if there 's an all-out military offensive , that 's going to change the equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">180 degrees</NUMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> , he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> ends its financial support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> .
     He asked that the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> .
     Not only did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> 's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">region</ENAMEX> , it came as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> elections .
     Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> are gathering in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> .
     And important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> must decide at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of November</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> are to receive the rest of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49 million</NUMEX> in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> .
     The humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> and clothing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> amassed along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Honduras</ENAMEX> , replaced the military aid cut off by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1988</TIMEX> .
     While few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were acknowledging that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contras</ENAMEX> have at times violated it themselves .

     In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> aid , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> 's remarks also played to the suspicions of some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">conservatives</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February</TIMEX> elections .

     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> first came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> and has been executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1988</TIMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staloff</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">44</TIMEX> , was a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philadelphia Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and is considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in new financial products .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> , he said , he and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> have been working on the new natural gas contract , seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market .
     `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are eager to begin trading this contract , so we expect no difficulty in attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> to the natural gas pit , '' he said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> 's extremely successful contracts in crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> and heating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> have made it the largest futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .

     Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> started investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , though no indictments have been handed down there .
     So far they have issued scores of subpoenas , some of which went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas .
     In a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> study , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules .

Conway</ENAMEX> , who then was responsible for policing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's busy oil and metal pits , `` was engaged in other personal business activities on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exchange</ENAMEX> time , '' including out-of-state trips , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> report prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway</ENAMEX> is no longer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     `` We had a management breakdown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> in terms of compliance , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> says .
     `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . ''
     He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> business plan calls for having adequate compliance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to ensure that exchange rules are being followed .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations .
     Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more exchanges .
     So far there is little to show for such efforts .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever .
     `` The cost of competition has become extremely high , '' he says .
     `` We must find ways to save money for the futures commission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchants</ENAMEX> who do business on our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> . ''
     He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to enter trades as they make them .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">GAO</ENAMEX> has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent , verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> is now cooperating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Comex</ENAMEX> in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> also are working on such a device .
     Another major electronics problem faces Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> -- the creation of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> trading system that can be used outside <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal trading hours</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> signed a letter of intent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Globex</ENAMEX> .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> said it was looking into creating a common system with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> , and it suspended negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Merc</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is n't waiting for the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> ' cooperation .
     It recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">ATS\/2</ENAMEX> , the automated trading system created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Commodities Clearing House</ENAMEX> .
     Looking ahead to commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Copper
</ENAMEX>     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Frawley</ENAMEX> , metals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said there is good technical support <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 1.10 and $ 1.12</NUMEX> a pound for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> , which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1580</NUMEX> a pound , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6 cents</NUMEX> .
     He views the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.10 to $ 1.12</NUMEX> range as a buying opportunity and considers the market oversold .
     `` I think the market could pop up to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.22 to $ 1.25</NUMEX> level without too much difficulty , '' he said .
     But he said it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 1.10 and $ 1.25</NUMEX> .
     He noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> should keep an eye on Wall Street .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O'Neill</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elders Futures Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said for a rally to occur , there must be demand from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> .
     He added that talk of strike settlements at producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> has been fully discounted .
     However , to resume the bull trend , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Neill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> would have to close over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.19</NUMEX> .
     He said there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> that might affect prices : the purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> and the unemployment report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Metals</ENAMEX>
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frawley</ENAMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> will be looking to buy -LCB- on -RCB- pullbacks , '' he said .
     He thought the moves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frawley</ENAMEX> , floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say there is good support for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 374 to $ 375</NUMEX> per ounce area , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 5.20</NUMEX> an ounce for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> and in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 485 to $ 490</NUMEX> an ounce range for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O'Neill</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elders Futures Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said the price action for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> is the best he has seen on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> basis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a year</TIMEX> .
     He said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> could portend a move to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 390</NUMEX> an ounce for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract .
     He also said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> should keep an eye on the stock market , because `` if the stock market rallies , that could spell trouble for the precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> . ''
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> should be on the lookout for how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> react to this rally .
     `` I expect to see some selling , but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past '' by selling and locking in prices for their production ?
     He noted that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> there was some light investor interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Grains</ENAMEX> And <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Soybeans</ENAMEX>
     Prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybean</ENAMEX> harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , warm and dry weather has sped the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> harvest and that is permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> drought .
     If the weather allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> to work in their fields over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">grain elevators</ENAMEX> will probably sell futures contracts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> in order to hedge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">their weekend</TIMEX> purchases from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> .
     That selling of futures contracts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">elevators</ENAMEX> is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> will also watch for whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> continues its traditional fall buying of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> .
     So far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> have bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 7.2 million metric tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> .
     There may be some activity in soybean prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> try to get rid of the contract for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> usually do n't want to take physical delivery of a contract , preferring instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration .

     Wall Street is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> , a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to record levels .
     As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pulp</ENAMEX> , a raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">material</ENAMEX> used in all sorts of paper , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 830</NUMEX> a metric ton <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past spring</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 380</NUMEX> a ton <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at the start of 1986</TIMEX> .
     But now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> profits fell at several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     `` Put your money in a good utility or bank stock , not a paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , '' advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Adler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are nearly as pessimistic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Palmero</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> expects a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> decline in earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between now and 1991</TIMEX> for `` commodity-oriented '' paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which account for the majority of the industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schneider</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duff &amp; Phelps</ENAMEX> sees paper-company stock prices falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 15 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> if there 's a recession .
     Paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> concede that business has been off recently .
     But they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions .
     Generally they maintain that , barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies , the industry is n't headed for a prolonged slump .
     `` It wo n't be an earthshaking drop , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adler</ENAMEX> lowered his rating from hold to `` avoid '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boise Cascade</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Champion International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Louisiana Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmero</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , is steering clear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gaylord Container</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stone Container</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Paper Board</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schneider</ENAMEX> is cool to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Abitibi-Price</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> would avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Camp</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in question believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are too pessimistic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> said , `` The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper</ENAMEX> emphasizes that it is better positioned than most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> for the coming overcapacity because its individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mills</ENAMEX> can make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> grade of paper .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boise-Cascade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> referred to a speech by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fery</ENAMEX> , in which he said that markets generally are stable , although some risk of further price deterioration exists .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stone Container</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Stone</ENAMEX> said that , unlike for some other paper products , demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stone</ENAMEX> 's principal commodity , unbleached containerboard , remains strong .
     He expects the price for that product to rise even more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gaylord Container</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are skeptical of it because it 's carrying a lot of debt .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Champion International</ENAMEX> said , `` We 've gotten our costs down and we 're better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we 've ever been . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Louisiana Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> said a number of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Paper Board</ENAMEX> said , `` We 're not as exposed as the popular perception of us . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> explained that its main product , bleached paperboard , which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes , historically does n't have sharp price swings .
     Because the stock prices of some paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> already reflect an expected profit slump , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> says he thinks that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> the share prices of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> may fall at most <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5 % to 10 %</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Paper Board</ENAMEX> may be overly discounted and looks `` tempting '' to him , he says , though he is n't yet recommending the shares .
     Wall Street is n't avoiding everything connected with paper .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmero</ENAMEX> recommends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Temple-Inland</ENAMEX> , explaining that it is `` virtually the sole major paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> not undergoing a major capacity expansion , '' and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Temple-Inland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> expects record earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , and `` we 're still pretty bullish '' on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say their gloomy forecasts have a flip side .
     Some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pulp</ENAMEX> from the commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices .
     Estimates on how much pulp prices will fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> currently run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 150 and $ 250</NUMEX> a metric ton .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> agree that the price drop should especially benefit the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scott Paper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kimberly-Clark</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scott</ENAMEX> says that assuming the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pulp</ENAMEX> continues to soften , `` We should do well .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shoney 's Inc.</ENAMEX> said it will report a write-off of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven cents</NUMEX> a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its fourth quarter ended yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> cited transaction costs from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> recapitalization as a result of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 160 million</NUMEX> restructuring of its bank debt .
     The write-off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> operating results .
     In addition , the effective interest rate on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 410 million</NUMEX> of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.66 %</NUMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> made the earnings projection for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990 , ending next March 31</TIMEX> , in an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> attending the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Tokyo Motor Show</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is spending heavily to bolster its dealership <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> and because of currency-exchange fluctuations .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next decade</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> plans to boost overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> exported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">slightly over one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> , and produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it has agreed to sell the extrusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.D.

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Aluminum</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.5 %</NUMEX> stake in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">aluminum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">smelter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hawesville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky</ENAMEX> .
     The sale of the extrusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> is subject to audit adjustments for working capital changes through the closing .

     The municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of its best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> turn into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> .
     Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and property\/casualty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , which together own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 36 %</NUMEX> of all municipal bonds , have been dumping their securities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said , there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> for every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Every day</TIMEX> we 're getting new bid lists '' from would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> can not continue to absorb this supply . ''
     As a result , yields on long-term muni bonds now stand at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95 %</NUMEX> of long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> yields , the highest such level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two years</TIMEX> .
     `` There is incredible negative psychology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> in the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Avedisian</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> . ''
     The yield on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> revenue bonds compiled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bond Buyer</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publication</ENAMEX> , now exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.50 %</NUMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> bond sale , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> expect yields on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> bonds to nearly match the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</NUMEX> yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
     For an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> federal tax bracket , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9 %</NUMEX> tax-free is the same as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.38 %</NUMEX> on a taxable investment .
     That 's a taxable-equivalent yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly three</NUMEX> percentage points more than the current yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
     How quickly things change .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This past summer</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices , making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period .
     But while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that municipal bonds still offer good value , you would n't know it by the way institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> are rushing to dump their holdings .
     Bond market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors .
     Big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan</ENAMEX> , which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan-loss reserves , are n't looking for tax-exempt income .
     `` We do n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> has sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> of tax-free bonds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> confirmed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> has significantly reduced its muni holdings , but could n't immediately confirm the amount .
     Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are rushing to sell before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> , when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out .
     There is speculation that property\/casualty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will sell even more munis as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     Fundamental factors are at work as well .
     Muni bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue , at a time when many state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> already face budget deficits and huge spending needs .
     The recent natural disasters , and the need of many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> to rebuild crumbling infrastructure , suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off .
     `` There is just so much going on that it 's difficult to pick just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> factor that 's driving the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Ian Heller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Chicago Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign .
     Mutual funds , for example , are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues .
     Because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen , some portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market rebounds .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avedisian</ENAMEX> believes that the mutual funds are selling muni bonds that have a negative convexity -- those that have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates .
     Such bonds , she says , are those that are nearing their call date .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the market 's tone could pick up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 787 million</NUMEX> bond offering goes well .
     The offering will include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 729 million</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20-year</TIMEX> tax-exempt bonds and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.8 million</NUMEX> of taxable bonds .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few weeks ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> of tax-exempts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> bonds have been beaten down for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three straight weeks</TIMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , some issues fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one</NUMEX> point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $ 10</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The sell-off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> bonds was triggered by concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> has issued so much supply recently that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting a little concerned .
     They 'd like to see some other names in their portfolios , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S. Appelbaum</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
     But he thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may be overreacting to the market 's problems .
     Overall , he says , municipal prices are `` very cheap '' and represent an `` excellent buying opportunity . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Market Activity
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds fell sharply on confusion about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> debt auction and rumors that a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> was unloading large amounts of long-term bonds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond ended at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 2\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5\/8</NUMEX> point from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 6.25</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The issue 's yield rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.88 %</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late Thursday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it needed to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</NUMEX> quickly and would do so by issuing new securities <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     Credit market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> to cancel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> sale and to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</NUMEX> of cash management bills .
     Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> announced it would sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">51-day</TIMEX> cash management bills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and said that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> sale of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.6 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills will take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , as usual , but the sale will settle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     By moving the settlement date ahead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> can raise money under the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.87 trillion</NUMEX> debt ceiling that is in effect through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , after which it reverts to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 trillion</NUMEX> .
     The market also was hurt by rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , was unloading some of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds it recently purchased .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> said the talk was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500 million</NUMEX> of bellwether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is thought to have purchased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 3 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds in a buying spree on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous Thursday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> apparently has wanted to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cantor</ENAMEX> provides price quotes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Telerate Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , a widely used electronic system .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX> 's moves puzzled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and created confusion among potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , many of whom decided to stay out of the market .
     As a result of its large-scale buying , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> now say that liquidity , or the ability to easily buy and sell , has been constrained in the benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond issue .
     In other markets :
     -- The junk bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> rallied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is selling its candy bar brands to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 370 million</NUMEX> .
     The sale price , which was above Wall Street expectations , sent many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> securities up by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point .
     `` It shows that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> of high-quality assets at high prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Long</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the high-yield research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp</ENAMEX> .
     Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> securities , which had been trading near their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> lows earlier in the session , bounced back after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's announcement that it agreed to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Baby Ruth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Butterfinger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Pearson</ENAMEX> candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nestle Foods</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-based food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .
     The sale , expected to close before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> , also includes a manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Franklin Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill</ENAMEX> .

     The premium the elderly pay for coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> 's bills under Part B of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> health insurance plan will rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29</NUMEX> a month in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.90</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> has voted to repeal most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Catastrophic Coverage Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , however , which would end the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> catastrophic-care premium , as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</NUMEX> of the wealthier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> .
     Under a less-sweeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> plan , the catastrophic-care <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> premium would continue , rising to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.90</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , but the surtax would be abolished .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> Part B pays <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> 's allowable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> 's bills after an annual deductible of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Catastrophic Coverage Act</ENAMEX> would add a stop-loss provision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> to limit the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> must pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> bills to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic-care plan would eliminate the cap on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> 's bills .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> prevails in its efforts to kill the catastrophic-care plan , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> Part B premium will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
