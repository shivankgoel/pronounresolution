     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Marshall Hahn Jr.</ENAMEX> has made corporate acquisitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> mode : kind and gentle .
     The question <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> : Can he act more like hard-charging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Roosevelt</ENAMEX> ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">62-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> is leading the forest-product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's unsolicited <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.19 billion</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> has n't faced in his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes .
     So far , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> is trying to entice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough .
     `` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says .
     But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies .
     If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> enters the game , for example , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> could face the dilemma of paying a premium for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> or seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> fall into the arms of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival</ENAMEX> . Given that choice , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> say the former university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold . `` There 's a price above which I 'm positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> has the courage not to pay , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D. Correll</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for pulp and paper .
     Says long-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Griffin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , corporate development , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WTD Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . ''
     He also is a consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> say . The decision to make the bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> , for example , was made only after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> knew he wanted to go after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> early on , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correll</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associates</ENAMEX> say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> picked up that careful approach to management as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Virginia Polytechnic Institute</ENAMEX> . Assuming that post at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the age of 35</TIMEX> , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">universities</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren H. Strother</ENAMEX> , a university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> who is researching a book on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> .
     But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> called in state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to arrest student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> who were occupying a university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> .
     That impressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert B. Pamplin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the time</TIMEX> , whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> had met while fundraising for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institute</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamplin</ENAMEX> enticed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> into joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> as executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> ; the move befuddled many in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> who did n't believe a university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> could make the transition to the corporate world .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> skipped <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade because his reading ability was so far above his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> . Moving rapidly through school , he graduated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Phi Beta Kappa</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Kentucky</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 18</TIMEX> , after spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only 2 1\/2 years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> .
     He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> agrees that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> say that 's an understatement .
     They call it `` photographic '' .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> also has engineered a surprising turnaround of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> . Taking over as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , he inherited a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> began selling non-core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">oil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> .
     He even sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> that made vinyl checkbook covers .
     At the same time , he began building up the pulp and paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segment</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new-home construction .
     The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction .
     The formula has paid off , so far .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's sales climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.5 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> took the reins .
     Profit from continuing operations has soared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 467 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> knows best . `` The record of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have diversified is n't all that impressive , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> would n't be a diversification .
     It would be a good match , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with high-quality assets and strong cash flows .
     The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would be the largest forest-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> in the world with combined sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 13 billion</NUMEX> .
     But can Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> carry it off ?
     In this instance , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> say , he is entering uncharted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">waters</ENAMEX> .
     Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn McAuley</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Manhattan Co.</ENAMEX> : `` This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved major portions of a package for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 500 million</NUMEX> in economic aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> that relies heavily on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240 million</NUMEX> in credit and loan guarantees in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agency for International Development</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appropriators</ENAMEX> approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Overseas Private Investment Corp.</ENAMEX> are increased by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> as part of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> package .
     The conference approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 55 million</NUMEX> in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sides</ENAMEX> are committed to adding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200 million</NUMEX> in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">administration</ENAMEX> .
     The agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and is sharply confined under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's budget .
     These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> was required to reallocate an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 140 million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
     And though the size of the loan guarantees approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> is significant , recent experience with a similar program in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Central America</ENAMEX> indicates that it could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> before the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> can fully use the aid effectively .
     The action on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> came as the conference separately approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220 million</NUMEX> for international population planning activities , an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> increase over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> are divided over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Nations Population Fund</ENAMEX> will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant .
     In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> area of common concern , the world environment , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 15 million</NUMEX> will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> .
     The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> airplane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> over the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> 's quota of exports to the profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> was stripped of this right because of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> differences with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> would have received a quota of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">30,537 metric tons</NUMEX> over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">21-month</TIMEX> period ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About a quarter</NUMEX> of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">the remaining 23,403 tons</NUMEX> are still a lucrative target for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> because the current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 cents</NUMEX> a pound runs as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nickel</NUMEX> a pound above the world rate .
     The potential sales are nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.3 million</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gray</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa .</ENAMEX> -RRB- began the bidding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Jamaica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Barbados</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Lewis</ENAMEX> , a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> , added a provision of his own intended to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bolivia</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> then broadened the list further by including all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">U.S. Caribbean Basin</ENAMEX> initiate as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> - backed by the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Jamaica</ENAMEX> , wary of upsetting its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Caribbean Basin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> , has apparently instructed its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> , but the greater question is whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> .
     In separate floor action , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.18 billion</NUMEX> in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> .
     The funding is attached to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 27.1 billion</NUMEX> transportation bill that goes next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> domestic airline flights .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> has been as likely to bounce bills back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     The most recent example was a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 17.3 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> bill funding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> .
     And after losing a battle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appropriators</ENAMEX> from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> are expected to be forced back to conference .

     Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">Bridges</ENAMEX>
     EVERYONE AGREES that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> need to be repaired or replaced .
     But there 's disagreement over how to do it .
     Highway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> insist the ornamental railings on older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> are n't strong enough to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> from crashing through .
     But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't want to lose the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
     `` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> and not to provide a scenic view , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack White</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Indiana Highway Department</ENAMEX> .
     He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">four-foot-high</NUMEX> concrete slab with no openings .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Richmond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">G Street Bridge</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garret Boone</ENAMEX> , who teaches art at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Earlham College</ENAMEX> , calls the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">structure</ENAMEX> `` just an ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> '' and one that blocks the view of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">park</ENAMEX> below .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Charter Oak Bridge</ENAMEX> will soon be replaced , the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">park</ENAMEX> .
     Compromises are possible .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizens</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Peninsula</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , upset over changes to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> , negotiated a deal : The bottom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the railing will be type F , while the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> will have the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> 's floral pattern .
     Similarly , highway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> agreed to keep the old railings on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Key Bridge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">sidewalk</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> .
     Tray Bon ?
     Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons
     PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scypher Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cup-Tote</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> , resembles the plastic loops used on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-packs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carrier</ENAMEX> can tote as many as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cups at once .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inventor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Marvin</ENAMEX> says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
     Lids are n't even needed .
     He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
     A few fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> are giving it a try .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> acknowledges some problems .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> has to find something to hang the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carrier</ENAMEX> on , so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> supplies a window hook .
     While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable .
     And unlike some trays , there 's no place for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> .
     Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World
     AN EXCHANGE of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> promises change on both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">sides</ENAMEX> .
     An exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> design and architecture opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> and will travel to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> .
     The event continues into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> and includes an exchange program to swap design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Carnegie-Mellon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Leningrad</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Mutchin Institute</ENAMEX> .

     Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 6</TIMEX> editorial `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Ill Homeless</ENAMEX> '' referred to research by us and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> that was reported in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 8</TIMEX> issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Journal of the American Medical Association</ENAMEX> .
     Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> .
     We have made no such statement .
     It is clear that most mentally ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX> do not become homeless .
     The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
     In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> .
     You did not note that the homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
     They suffered from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
     Homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
     In a recent report , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> lacks adequate shelter .
     The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . ''
     If we look to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective .
     This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research .

     A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Tulane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
     The study shows that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40 %</NUMEX> of the homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> living below the poverty level .

     Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> , obviously , had pre-existing mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or addiction .
     But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> .
     Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">drink</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX> ?

     You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77 %</NUMEX> might have played a significant role in the increased number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> sleeping on our city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .

     But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> ?
     Why did n't you mention the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">YMCA</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">YWCA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Catholic Charities USA</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> other nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> that participated in the march ?

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> passed legislation designed to make it easier for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to block airline leveraged buy-outs .
     The final vote came after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> efforts to weaken the bill and approved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amendments sought by organized labor .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> vote suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> have the potential to override a veto .
     The broader question is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> stands on the issue .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> has approved legislation similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> bill on airline leveraged buy-outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .
     Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , it is aimed at giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
     `` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> up with debt that it would impede safety or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's ability to compete , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul Hammerschmidt</ENAMEX> , -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ark .</ENAMEX> -RRB- said .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .

     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to reject airline acquisitions if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> seeking to purchase a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> had run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> previously that have filed for protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> .

     Follow-up report : You now may drop by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice of America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> and read the text of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> is broadcasting to those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around the world who tune in to it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each week</TIMEX> .
     You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read .
     You can do all this even if you 're not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     And my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> can print the text of those broadcasts .
     Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the other day</TIMEX> , you as an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">democracy</ENAMEX> had no right to see what your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> was telling your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX> around the world .
     That was the law .
     And I apparently had no right to print hither what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> was booming to yon .
     It was censorship .
     It was outrageous .
     And it was stupid .
     The theory was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> is a propaganda <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> should n't propagandize its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     That sounds neat , but this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> -- any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> -- propagandizes its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> .
     Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">publications</ENAMEX> are all propaganda of sorts .
     Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint , and the beauty of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">democracy</ENAMEX> is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue .
     The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> material were especially absurd : An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> in the information business was not being allowed to inform .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1988</TIMEX> , I wrote in this space about this issue .
     Assuming it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , I 'll review the facts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice of America</ENAMEX> is a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> languages to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> around the world .
     It does a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-rate job .
     Its budget <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 184 million</NUMEX> -- is paid for by you .
     But a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1948</TIMEX> law barred the `` dissemination '' of that material in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The law let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> read texts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VOA</ENAMEX> material , only at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VOA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , but it barred them from copying texts .
     And , of course , there 's that word `` dissemination . ''
     How 's that again ?
     `` You may come by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> explained when I asked .
     What if I tune in my short-wave radio , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> ? `` Nor are you free to reprint such material , '' I was advised .
     That sounded a lot like censorship , so after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of letters and conversations that went nowhere , I sued .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> , I lost the case in federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Des Moines</ENAMEX> .
     At least , that 's the way it was reported .
     And , indeed , the lawsuit was dismissed .
     But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we , all of us -- won the point .
     For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">United States Information Agency</ENAMEX> , which runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> , changed its position on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key points .
     -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> said that , on reflection , of course I could print anything I could get my hands on .
     The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> to disseminate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> program materials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> , '' my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , the scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McCormick</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Des Moines</ENAMEX> , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> noted the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> position but , just in case , officially found `` that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> did not intend to preclude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> from disseminating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> information domestically . ''
     -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> said that , on reflection , anyone could view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VOA</ENAMEX> materials , not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> who are mentioned in the statute .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> has determined that it will not check the credentials of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> appearing and requesting to see the materials , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCormick</ENAMEX> noted .
     -- And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> said that all of us could take extensive notes .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who examine the materials may make notes and , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> position is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has taken , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCormick</ENAMEX> reported .
     I had sought , in my suit , the right to print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> material , which had been denied me , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> disagreed .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> proscribes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> from passing laws abridging the right to free speech , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald O'Brien</ENAMEX> ruled .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> does not prescribe a duty upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to assure easy access to information for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the press . ''
     So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> the situation is this : You have a right to read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice of America</ENAMEX> scripts if you do n't mind traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every week</TIMEX> or so and visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">business hours</TIMEX> .
     I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand .
     But neither of us can copy the material on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> machine or have it sent to us .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an era</TIMEX> when every government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not , this does seem odd .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> ruled that `` it would be easy to conclude that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> 's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid , ' '' but it 's the law .
     So the next step , I suspect , is to try to get the law changed .
     We -LRB- I assume you 're in this with me at this point -RRB- need to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 501</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> material shall be available to certain of us -LRB- but now , thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> 's new position , all of us -RRB- `` for examination only . ''
     If those words were n't there , the nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Voice</ENAMEX> would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it .
     This is not a trivial issue .
     `` You have ... raised important questions which ought to be answered : What does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USIA</ENAMEX> say about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> get the answers to these questions ? '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wrote me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Z. Wick</ENAMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the time</TIMEX> , he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the
     He had no answers then .
     Now there are some .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">democracy</ENAMEX> is suddenly a little more democratic .
     I feel pretty good about it .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert M. Baum</ENAMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">53-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell U.S.A.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin L. Harper</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">47</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , will run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> is named .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> already has been searching for strong outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> , including food-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with considerable international experience .
     Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> 's departure and its implications .
     In heavy trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's shares rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.375</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47.125</NUMEX> .
     `` The profit motive of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> has clearly changed for the better , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McMillin</ENAMEX> , a food industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented .
     `` New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> would think a little more like Wall Street , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McMillin</ENAMEX> added .
     Some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation , which has contributed to volatility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> shares in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> , appear to be at the heart of its problems .
     Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> is a distant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> frozen foods market , where it recently paid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> times earnings for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freshbake Foods PLC</ENAMEX> and wound up with far more capacity than it could use .
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> biscuit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">D. Lazzaroni &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems .
     Such problems will require considerable skill to resolve .
     However , neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> has much international experience .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> , a seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketer</ENAMEX> who is said to have a good rapport with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepperidge Farm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> of several manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> who joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pepperidge</ENAMEX> .
     In an joint interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> said they would like to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's next chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">63</TIMEX> , had been under intense pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's mediocre performance to the level of other food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Dorrance Jr.</ENAMEX> , who controlled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 58 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's stock when he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> took a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 343 million</NUMEX> pretax charge against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan .
     The plan calls for closing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> and eliminating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,600</NUMEX> jobs .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , and there were signs that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> became impatient .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> was n't available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to discuss the circumstances of his departure .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the agenda of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> was fired .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the conventional retirement age of 65</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1991</TIMEX> , `` unless I get fired . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> had withdrawn his name as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for re-election as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> shareholder meeting , scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 17</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> received a salary of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 877,663</NUMEX> .
     He owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 45,000</NUMEX> shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> stock and has options to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> additional shares .
     He will be eligible for an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> pension of more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 244,000</NUMEX> with certain other fringe benefits .
     During Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nine-year term</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sales rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.7 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</NUMEX> and net income increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 274 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130 million</NUMEX> , the statement said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> said he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> both advocated closing some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as long ago as early 1988</TIMEX> .
     `` You 've got to make the restructuring work , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> .
     `` You 've got to make those savings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> expressed confidence that he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> can convince the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of their worthiness to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     `` We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , '' he said .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> was n't named , which fueled speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> may have clashed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.I.

     Abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> .
     In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> said his departure `` evolved out of discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si Newhouse</ENAMEX> and that 's the decision I reached . ''
     He declined to elaborate , other than to say , `` It just seemed the right thing to do at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this minute</TIMEX> .
     Sometimes you just go with your gut . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> said he will stay until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 31</TIMEX> and work with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> , who is to be named soon .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , insisted that he is n't unhappy with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> or the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> , the largest trade publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales volume increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> 's tenure .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . ''
     Publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> believe that while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Crown Publishing Group</ENAMEX> , acquired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , is said to be turning in disappointing results .
     As a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> does n't report its earnings .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> , who succeeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett Cerf</ENAMEX> , has been only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> since it was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1925</TIMEX> .
     Speculation on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> centers on a number of division <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> .
     Possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Petersen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> 's huge and successful paperback <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     Some say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Cheetham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a recently acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Century Hutchinson</ENAMEX> , could be chosen .
     There is also speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> could bring in a powerhouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> or another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> to run the business side , in combination with a publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gottlieb</ENAMEX> , who left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alfred A. Knopf</ENAMEX> to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , also owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> .
     Not included on the most-likely-successor list are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joni Evans</ENAMEX> , recruited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of adult trade books for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Random House</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny Mehta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alfred A.

     When Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> took her job , several important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> that had reported to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> is widely viewed as a brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> but a less-than-brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> and his own departure was rumored recently .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> learned during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> that it could intimidate the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> by uttering again and again the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . ''
     This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     It signals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II of the Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .
     The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . ''
     The prevailing interpretation of the clause on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> is that it gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> through the ability to withhold funding .
     This interpretation was officially endorsed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> Report .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX> of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .
     It is not supported by the text or history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Constitutional Convention of 1787</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX> 's notes .
     To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> needed a unitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Confederation Congress</ENAMEX> had performed poorly under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Articles of Confederation</ENAMEX> .
     It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's short leash , making the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> consist of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     As it went to the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> contained some breathtaking attempts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to rewrite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> under the pretext of protecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> 's money .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming weeks</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> , and thus void and severable .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> appropriations legislation attempts to strip the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> places on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> '' appoint , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> , and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     It also empowers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to make recess appointments , without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> approval : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''
     Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 605</ENAMEX> of the appropriations bill for the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> provides : `` No part of any appropriation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current fiscal year</TIMEX> contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> has voted not to approve the nomination of said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> . ''
     Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> repeals the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's power to make recess appointments under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 605</ENAMEX> also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's ability to nominate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> of his choosing .
     The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> will result in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> being denied funding to pay that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> 's salary .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> willing to serve without pay , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Anti-Deficiency Act</ENAMEX> prohibits voluntary service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II of the Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Such laws violate the provision in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> that requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to make recommendations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , but which gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .
     Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations .
     Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> that prevents the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny .
     There is something inherently suspect about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's prohibiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
     Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> better illustrates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's attempt to usurp executive power than <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 609</ENAMEX> of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> . ''
     This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's execution of the law , since a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> nor presentation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for his signature or veto .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's decision in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">INS</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chadha</ENAMEX> held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> fails to do so in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">first year</TIMEX> , he will invite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II of the Constitution</ENAMEX> to suit its purposes .
     What becomes custom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> will only become more difficult for future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> , to undo .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> learned that lesson .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">then-Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Wright</ENAMEX> was discussing arms control in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> and then attempting to direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , through an appropriations rider , to treat the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> as though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> had ratified <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SALT II</ENAMEX> .
     If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> unfunded , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> does not expressly give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> such power .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> does have a duty not to violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
     Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's duties and prerogative under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article II</ENAMEX> would be different from the line-item veto .
     As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives .
     The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
     One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .
     There is no downside if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> appropriations bills .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> does nothing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will have won .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> takes the dispute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> -LRB- assuming it can establish standing to sue -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> might win .
     In that case , he might receive an opinion from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> that is a vindication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> thought should be entrusted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> loses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , it might be disappointing , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> was for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     But the presidency would be no worse off than it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX> would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice .
     As it stands now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> presumes after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> should set things straight .
     If he does not , he will help realize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison</ENAMEX> 's fear in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Federalist No. 48</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidak</ENAMEX> served as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .

     Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Farm Belt</ENAMEX> rose to a new high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 59.9 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The previous record was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.7 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> . Net cash income -- the amount left in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Economic Research Service</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Most of those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> set farm income records .
     The worst crop damage occurred in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwestern Corn Belt</ENAMEX> and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Great Plains</ENAMEX> .
     What saved many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a bad year</TIMEX> was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">crops</ENAMEX> that they had `` mortgaged '' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> under price-support loan programs . With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>-page report said .
     In less parched areas , meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices .
     To the surprise of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Dakotas</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> attributed the increases partly to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> disaster-assistance package enacted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> .
     It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">lobbies</ENAMEX> and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> to make any significant changes in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> farm program <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Commodity prices have been rising in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses . At the same time , export demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and other commodities strengthened , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Collins</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmers</ENAMEX> also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's cattle inventory dropped close to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> low .
     `` All of these forces came together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> to benefit agriculture , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 billion</NUMEX> in net cash income <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.9 billion</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.4 billion</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.1 billion</NUMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> were among the few major farm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to log a decline in net cash income .
     Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> was a severe financial setback for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 10,000 to 15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> .
     Many lost their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">farms</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> do n't expect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> to be as good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> was .
     Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> as farm expenses rise and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> decline .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same time</TIMEX> , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> buying by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> slipped to less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.5 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 16.7 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Payments are expected to range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .

     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of struggling , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Herald Examiner</ENAMEX> will publish its last edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , shut down by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst Corp.</ENAMEX> , following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> .
     The demise of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">238,000</NUMEX>-circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> , once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> with circulation exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700,000</NUMEX> , turns the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> , at least in some senses .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , with a circulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.1 million</NUMEX> , dominates the region .
     But it faces stiff competition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Orange County</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Orange County Register</ENAMEX> , which sells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300,000</NUMEX> copies a day , and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Daily News</ENAMEX> , which sells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 170,000</NUMEX> .
     Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pasadena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Long Beach</ENAMEX> also have large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dailies</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> on the block .
     Speculation had it that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was asking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> said to be losing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20 million</NUMEX> a year , but others said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> might have virtually given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> away .
     An attempted buy-out led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. McCabe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> dismissed as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tire-kickers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lookee-loos</ENAMEX> '' had filed through since .
     The prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toronto Sun</ENAMEX> .
     The death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> , a newsstand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> in a freeway <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> , was perhaps inevitable .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times</ENAMEX> , then target a particular area with one of the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dailies</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> was left in limbo .
     Further , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> but never executed the plan .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> joins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baltimore News-American</ENAMEX> , which folded , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Herald-American</ENAMEX> , which was sold , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">cornerstones</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> abandoned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     Many felt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history .
     Its fanciful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">offices</ENAMEX> were designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Morgan</ENAMEX> , who built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">castle</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Simeon</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph Hearst</ENAMEX> had kept an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Renaissance-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry . `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">survivor</ENAMEX> from a bygone age , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.

     `` Actually , the long deterioration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> shows signs of coming to an end , and the industry looks pretty healthy . ''
     Founded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Examiner</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1903</TIMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hearst</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> was crippled by a bitter , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decade</TIMEX>-long strike that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> and cut circulation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> .
     Financially , it never recovered ; editorially , it had its moments .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bellows</ENAMEX> , who brightened the editorial product considerably .
     He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Anne Dolan</ENAMEX> , restored respect for the editorial product , and though in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> had been limping along on limited resources , its accomplishments were notable .
     For example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> consistently beat its much-larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival</ENAMEX> on disclosures about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Bradley</ENAMEX> 's financial dealings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herald</ENAMEX> 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Danzig</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst Newspapers</ENAMEX> , stood up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">newsroom</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and announced that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> had stepped forward and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> would fold , putting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 730</NUMEX> full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> out of work .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> said it would provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with a placement service and pay them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">60 days</TIMEX> .
     Some long-tenured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> will receive additional benefits , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Hours</TIMEX> after the announcement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Orange County Register</ENAMEX> were in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bar</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> recruiting .
     The reaction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">newsroom</ENAMEX> was emotional .
     `` I 've never seen so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> crying in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Johnson</ENAMEX> , an assistant city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> .

     If you 'd really rather have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> , do n't leave home without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card .
     Or so the slogan might go .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> 's beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> 's sales while encouraging broader use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are giving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-day</TIMEX> vacations for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> who charge all or part of their down payments on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> green card .
     They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 18</TIMEX> and will end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 18</TIMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card holders</ENAMEX> .
     Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would disclose the program 's cost .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> about a joint promotion because its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card holders</ENAMEX> generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> also represents the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> has been seeking for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> to restore its reputation as `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> '' -- a product for upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> .
     Sales were roughly flat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1989 model year</TIMEX> compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , though industry sales fell .
     But since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990 model year</TIMEX> began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> sales have plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> expects to get much of the future growth in its card business .
     Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip Riese</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , says the promotion with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> is his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's first with an auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , but `` hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . ''
     To that end , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> has been signing up gasoline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> , tire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> to accept the card .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> now let <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> charge part or all of their purchase on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card , but few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card holders</ENAMEX> realize this , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riese</ENAMEX> says . Until now , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> who wanted to finance part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> purchase through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Acceptance Corp.</ENAMEX> could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> approved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> program , he says , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riese</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> considers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> `` very sophisticated direct-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketers</ENAMEX> , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability . '' In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> is a relatively respected nameplate among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card holders</ENAMEX> , says an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in a mailing which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> came in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 24 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card holders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , and over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> have the green card .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> screened the card-member list for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">more than 30 years old</TIMEX> with household incomes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 45,000</NUMEX> who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> says .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 3.8 million</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> who will get letters were preapproved for credit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> .
     These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> also are eligible to get one percentage point off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> 's advertised finance rates , which start at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> loan contracts .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Visa International</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> link .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> are working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> on the promotion : the establishment services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , which is responsible for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">merchants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that accept the card ; the travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> ; and the merchandise sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals .
     Destinations are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Honolulu</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami Beach</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Orleans</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Orlando</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX>
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> 's ticket free if they fly on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     In lieu of the vacation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Card holders</ENAMEX> who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> vacation as prizes .
     If they test-drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> , they get an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> calculator .
     This is n't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> 's first travel-related promotion .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> round-trip tickets on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Riviera</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     The promotion helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Riviera</ENAMEX> sales exceed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> 's forecast by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> said at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the time</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">United Kingdom High Court</ENAMEX> declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> borough <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham</ENAMEX> ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">As many as 70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> and international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> stand to lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred million pounds</NUMEX> should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">municipalities</ENAMEX> .
     An appeal is expected .
     In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .
     Gilts , or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3\/8</NUMEX> point lower .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> , which is alleged to have engaged in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 600</NUMEX> deals valued at over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 6 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.5 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- , lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of pounds</NUMEX> from soured swap deals .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Hammersmith</ENAMEX> is reported to have accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 10 %</NUMEX> of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .
     When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">parties</ENAMEX> engage in an interest-rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates .
     Thus , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institution</ENAMEX> obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments .
     In most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> transactions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">municipalities</ENAMEX> agreed to make floating-rate payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , which would make fixed-rate payments .
     As interest rates rose , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">municipalities</ENAMEX> owed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> were paying them .
     The court hearing began in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> at the request of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Hazell</ENAMEX> , district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Hammersmith</ENAMEX> , who argued that local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">councils</ENAMEX> are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> backed the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Hammersmith and Fulham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> was by far the most active local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">authority</ENAMEX> engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> other local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">councils</ENAMEX> .
     `` While this court ruling was only on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Hammersmith</ENAMEX> , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor</ENAMEX> representing one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> said .
     Already , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">councils</ENAMEX> have refused to honor fees and payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> incurred during various swaps dealings .
     Other financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> involved include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barclays Bank PLC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midland Bank PLC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Finance International</ENAMEX> .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Banks</ENAMEX> could seek to recover payments to local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">authorities</ENAMEX> in instances where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> made net payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">councils</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> from the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> involved are expected to meet during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days</TIMEX> to consider other arrangements with local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">authorities</ENAMEX> that could be questionable .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">28 days</TIMEX> to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .

     In the aftermath of the stock market 's gut-wrenching <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbrokers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">trader</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target</ENAMEX> of their wrath ?
     Their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> 's minicrash , Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading , the computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> .
     But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market .
     The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards .
     Program trading itself , according to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace .
     The evidence indicates that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , though it may have exacerbated it .
     On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of this power struggle stand the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in ascendency on Wall Street -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">New Guard</ENAMEX> -- consisting of high-tech computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> at the major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , their pension fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> with immense pools of money , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> at the fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     These are the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of program trading .
     Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guard</ENAMEX> -- the traditional , stock-picking money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stock brokers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 's listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and the clannish floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , who make markets in their stocks .
     So far , Wall Street 's Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guard</ENAMEX> seems to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tormentors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">futures marketplace</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to approve some additional restrictions on program trading .
     Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot , almost all the big investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program trading , for their own accounts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few days</TIMEX> .
     A few , such as giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Guard</ENAMEX> 's assault on program trading and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> has been fierce and broad-based , in part because some Old Guard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> feel their very livelihood is at stake .
     Some , such as traditional money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Neuberger &amp; Berman</ENAMEX> , have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">specialists</ENAMEX> , in a bold palace revolt , began shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> to telephone the corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> whose stock is listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to have them pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> to ban program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel Corp.</ENAMEX> who is rallying other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> to the anti-program trading cause , says he has received `` countless '' letters offering support .
     `` They said universally , without a single exception : Do n't even compromise .
     Kill it , '' he says .
     Wall Street 's New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guard</ENAMEX> is n't likely to take all this lying down for long , however .
     Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable .
     Program trading money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , and the pressures on such money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them .
     What 's more , the last time major Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash -- they waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months</TIMEX> and then sneaked back into it .
     Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Guard</ENAMEX> , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">New Guard</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Bradley</ENAMEX> , one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's most respected floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> , surrendered .
     He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> in which he said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is too focused on machines , rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is `` headed for a real crisis '' if program trading is n't curbed .
     `` I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">casino</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> wrote .
     The battle has turned into a civil war at some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> , causing internal contradictions and pitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> , and other big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbrokers</ENAMEX> battle their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> a few floors away .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Corporations</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel</ENAMEX> denounce program trading , yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel</ENAMEX> has in the past hired pension fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">managers</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> that are also big program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's premier stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> -- is sharply divided between its floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and its top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     Its entrenched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> stock specialists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are fighting tooth and nail against programs .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> -- over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> ' protests -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> began trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program trading .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would like to go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> , '' before program trading , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     `` I would like to go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> .
     But we are not going back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> . ''
     Again and again , program-trading 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> raise the `` casino '' theme .
     They say greedy market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manipulators</ENAMEX> have made a shambles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's free-enterprise system , turning the stock market into a big gambling den , with the odds heavily stacked against the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> did n't come to the market to play a game ; they can go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Off-Track Betting</ENAMEX> for that , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Brean Murray</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brean Murray , Foster Securities</ENAMEX> , a traditional money management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , portray old-fashioned stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickers</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neanderthals</ENAMEX> of the industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> `` are looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use computers to trade are a convenient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boogieman</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Thomas Allen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advanced Investment Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that runs a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> fund that uses index arbitrage .
     `` Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> for protection . ''
     For all the furor , there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage , the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading .
     Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures markets .
     That divergence is what stock index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> seek .
     When it occurs , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks -LRB- such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stocks that constitute the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 stock index -RRB- in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .
     Such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> of stock , occur in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> .
     A program trade of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25,000</NUMEX> .
     To keep program-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> must seize every opportunity their computers find .
     The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> profess to despise .
     `` If you continue to do this , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> becomes frightened -- any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> : the odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lotter</ENAMEX> , mutual funds and pension funds , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Zicklin</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Neuberger &amp; Berman</ENAMEX> .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations .
     `` I have not seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Vanderbilt University</ENAMEX> finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Stoll</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on the subject .
     Says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , `` Volatility is greater than program trading . ''
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> plunge was triggered not by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , but by news of the unraveling of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Unable to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> and other airline shares , takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> , or risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> , dumped every blue-chip stock they had .
     While program trades swiftly kicked in , a `` circuit breaker '' that halted trading in stock futures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> made some program trading impossible .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Del Signore</ENAMEX> , head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers Investment Management Co.</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are ignoring `` the role the -LCB- takeover stock -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculator</ENAMEX> is taking in the market as a source of volatility . ''
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbs</ENAMEX> are `` overleveraged , '' she says , and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''
     Like virtually everything on Wall Street , the program-trading battle is over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">money</NUMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traditionalists</ENAMEX> have been losing out on bundles of it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">New Guard</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     Take the traditional money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , or `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stock pickers</ENAMEX> , '' as they are derisively known among the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX> .
     Traditional stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> like to charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> they manage for big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , and higher fees for smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Yet many such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> consistently fail to even keep up with , much less beat , the returns of standard benchmarks like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX>
     Not surprisingly , old-style money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have been losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> to giant stock-index <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">funds</ENAMEX> that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&amp;P 500 .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX> charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few pennies</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> managed .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 200 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of all pension-fund stock investments , is held by index funds .
     The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> stock-specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     These small but influential floor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> long have earned fat returns of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> a year on their capital , by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">specialists</ENAMEX> see any step to electronic trading as a death knell .
     And they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> , has abandoned their interest .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> and once one himself , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> dislike so much -- to keep index <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">funds</ENAMEX> and other program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> from taking their business to overseas markets .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility .
     `` When the sell programs hit , you can hear the order printers start to go '' on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading floor , says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> there .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> walk away , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> is left alone '' as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> of last resort for his stable of stocks , he contends .
     No one is more unhappy with program trading than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbrokers</ENAMEX> .
     They are still trying to lure back small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> spooked by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then .
     `` Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond A. Mason</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legg Mason Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stockbrokers</ENAMEX> ' business and pay has been falling .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">$ 71,309</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> lower than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> resent that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket .
     Index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who buy all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stocks in the S&amp;P 500 often do n't even know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> they own actually do , complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Sigler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Champion International Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs ?
     Oh , you 're in the paper business , '' is one reaction Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigler</ENAMEX> says he 's gotten from his big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this September</TIMEX> , program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> were doing a record <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> trading volume .
     Among the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">practitioners</ENAMEX> were Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">blue bloods</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Group Inc</ENAMEX> .
     But then came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> and the negative publicity orchestrated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Guard</ENAMEX> , particularly against index arbitrage .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX> ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die .
     `` There 's a lynch-mob psychology <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">right now</TIMEX> , '' says the top program-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at a Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` Wall Street 's cash cow has been gored , but I do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem . ''
     Too much money is at stake for program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">traders</ENAMEX> to give up .
     For example , stock-index futures began trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched .
     Stock futures trading has minted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX> in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">20s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">30s</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good day</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's stock-index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> trade more <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> worth of stock futures than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trades in stock .
     Now the stage is set for the battle to play out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-programmers</ENAMEX> are getting some helpful thunder from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have to have a system that says to those largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> :
     ` Sit down !
     You will not panic ,
     you will not put the financial system in jeopardy . ' ''
     But the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> , think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say .
     `` You 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vanderbilt</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> . ``
     Program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ''
     Short of a total ban , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-programmers</ENAMEX> have proposed several middle-ground reforms , which they say would take away certain advantages program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> currently enjoy in the marketplace that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> do n't .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the `` good-faith '' payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks .
     Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 7 %</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative .
     Program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> also want the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Futures traders</ENAMEX> respond that low margins help keep their markets active .
     Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who help larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy and sell , they say .
     Another proposed reform is to have program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great Crash of 1929</ENAMEX> that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short sellers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets .
     A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> would slow their activity considerably .
     Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Phelan</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that he could support letting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings .
     Thus the band-wagon psychology of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> picks up new impetus .
     Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading .
     As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different .
     In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&amp;P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> and the stock markets largely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&amp;P 500 widget in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&amp;P 500 widget in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     If the money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> performing this service is being paid by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to match or beat the return of the S&amp;P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .
     -LRB- Few , if any , index-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> will risk leveraging performance by owning <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 100 %</NUMEX> exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> position should stocks rise . -RRB-
     By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> hope to add <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 1 % and 3 %</NUMEX> to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> return of the S&amp;P 500 .
     That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stock pickers</ENAMEX> claim to seek as their performance objective .
     The fact that a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> of fundamentalist money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> fail to beat the S&amp;P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue .
     As more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated .
     The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares .
     So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> ?
     All arguments against program trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -RRB- reduced volatility , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -RRB- a long-term investment focus , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -RRB- a level playing field for the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> .
     But many of these reforms are unneeded , even harmful .
     Reducing volatility .
     An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> to cover all transaction costs .
     Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it .
     Think about what causes the difference in prices between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markets for S&amp;P 500 stocks -- usually it is large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> initiating a buy or sell in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     A large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures .
     Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , while functioning as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     The start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .
     Why does this large hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> ?
     Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade .
     In a competitive market , this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> has many ways to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives -LRB- both foreign and domestic -RRB- if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle .
     If not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , then in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> ; if not the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , then overseas .
     Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .
     Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less .
     The speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome .
     If slowing things down could reduce volatility , stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future .
     Encouraging long-term investing .
     We must be very cautious about labeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . ''
     Policies designed to encourage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> over another are akin to placing a sign over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's door saying : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Buyers</ENAMEX> welcome , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> please go away ! '' The ultimate goal of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> is a profit motive , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> should not concern themselves with whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are sufficiently focused on the long term .
     A free market with a profit motive will attract each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .
     In point of fact , volatility as measured by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annualized</TIMEX> standard deviation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Periods</TIMEX> before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973-75</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1937-40</TIMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1928-33</TIMEX> for example -RRB- .
     It is interesting to see the fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stock pickers</ENAMEX> scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise .
     Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goblins</ENAMEX> ?
     Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .
     In using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> stand to gain the high ground in wooing small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> for their existing stock-selection products .
     They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .
     How does a nice new tax , say <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> , on any financial transaction sound ?
     That ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term .
     Getting a level playing field .
     This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits , but because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> championing the cause .
     The loudest of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> are money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who cater to smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     They continually advise their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> on which individual stocks to buy or sell , while their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> continue to hope for superior performance .
     Even with mutual funds , the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> continues to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance , while index-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk .
     Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> studiously devouring press clippings on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> he follows .
     Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences .
     If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous , surely any sizable mutual-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> could profit from offering it to small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The sad reality is that the retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> continues to pursue stellar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">performers</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , while leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> .
     Cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> frequently pay , and that institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> refuse to pay .
     Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> seeking better ways to serve their high-volume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , here or overseas .
     Legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     So what is next for program trading ?
     Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably .
     Spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> or private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">watchdogs</ENAMEX> insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets -LRB- limits on price moves , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. -RRB- , the end loser will be the markets themselves .
     Instead , we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> .

     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> are warning that a complicated new funding device for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> federal antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , would affect the antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">operations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> .
     As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> cut by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's request for antitrust enforcement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> , which began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> .
     To offset the reduction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> approved a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> fee that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Brooks</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
     `` It could operate to augment our budget , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rill</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> 's antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> , said in an interview .
     Under measures approved by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's request for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47 million</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Antitrust Division</ENAMEX> would be cut <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC</ENAMEX> budget request of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million</NUMEX> of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> as was appropriated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> .
     The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart-Scott-Rodino Act</ENAMEX> .
     Under that law , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> or more must notify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> before completing the transactions .
     Currently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> charges nothing for such filings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> a year , the fees will yield <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 40 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fiscal year</TIMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> more than the budget cuts .
     `` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> '' each for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Smith</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> -RRB- said during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> debate .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif</ENAMEX> . -RRB- responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .
     The antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> were cut <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> is not the time to signal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> argued .
     Any money in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> collected from the fees in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> would go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> at large .
     Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
     Though some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> reported that prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">acquirers</ENAMEX> were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect , government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they had n't noticed any surge in filings .

     Program trading is `` a racket , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Egnuss</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">White Plains</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> and electronics sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , that 's for sure . ''
     But although he thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts it could be stopped .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egnuss</ENAMEX> 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> interviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     But like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egnuss</ENAMEX> , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be .
     `` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Fields</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> .
     He notes that program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading .
     But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .
     He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds .
     He adds : `` The market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming . ''
     Or , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Arighi</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior decorator</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Arnold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , puts it : `` All kinds of funny things spook the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> . ''
     But she believes that `` program trading creates deviant swings .
     It 's not a sound thing ; there 's no inherent virtue in it . ''
     She adds that legislation curbing it would be `` a darned good idea . ''
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Schwab &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Buckhead</ENAMEX> district , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> voices skepticism that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would curb program trading .
     Citing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Miller</ENAMEX> says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Donald Anderson</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">59-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Those</ENAMEX> who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it .
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Wamre</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">31-year-old</TIMEX> asset <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> . ''
     Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation .
     `` I think we 've got enough securities laws , '' he says .
     `` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Anthony</ENAMEX> , who runs an employment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .
     `` I do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism , '' he explains .
     And surprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> of small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Britta</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">25-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> who plays options for his personal account , says he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . ''
     He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market .
     You ca n't hold back technology . ''
     And the practice should n't be stopped , he says , because `` even big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . ''
     Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Silverman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurance-company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned .
     There 's no culprit here .
     The market is just becoming more efficient . ''
     Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says .
     He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a given day</TIMEX> , may hurt the fund .
     But `` I 'm a long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     `` If you were a short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , you might be more leery about program trading . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Enzor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge .
     `` If we have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a real bad day</TIMEX> , the program would say , ` Buy , ' '' he explains .
     `` If you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . ''
     What else can a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> do ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Taccetta</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> , is going into money-market funds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taccetta</ENAMEX> says he had just recouped the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> he lost in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash when he lost more money last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     Now , he plans to sell all his stocks by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter of 1990</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , before the market dropped , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arighi</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Arnold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery '' caused by program trading .
     She believes that the only answer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucille Gorman</ENAMEX> , an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">84-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> , has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorman</ENAMEX> took advantage of low prices after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> plunge .
     `` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she says .
     `` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing .
     On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> , moving the materials closer to commercial use .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">600,000 amps per square centimeter</NUMEX> in a moderately strong magnetic field .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> said they made the advance with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">yttrium</ENAMEX>-containing superconductors cooled to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">liquid-nitrogen</ENAMEX> temperature , or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:TEMPERATURE">minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit</NUMEX> .
     Their report appears in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nature</ENAMEX> .
     The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
     Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled .
     A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome .
     But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert B. van Dover</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> .
     He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals .
     Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dover</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential .
     The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current-carrying capacity .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dover</ENAMEX> said the crystal changes his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dover</ENAMEX> added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
     Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt-textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> .
     The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
