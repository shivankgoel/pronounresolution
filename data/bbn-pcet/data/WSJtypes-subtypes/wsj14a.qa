     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Groupe AG</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knight</ENAMEX> if necessary to repel a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> .
     Amid heavy buying of shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Belgium</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Lippens</ENAMEX> also warned in an interview that a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knight</ENAMEX> , in buying out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> , could leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> with big losses on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> stock .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> , the stock has nearly doubled , giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> a market value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 105 billion Belgian francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     The most likely white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knight</ENAMEX> would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.</ENAMEX> , which already owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> and which itself is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere de Suez</ENAMEX> , the acquisitive <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> said a rescue also could involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> is hardly alone in its anxiety .
     A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's once-stately insurance business .
     Worried by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">services</ENAMEX> , starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1990</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> are rushing to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> and preparing for price wars .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> are flirting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suez</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa-Midi Assurances S.A.</ENAMEX> both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suez</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> acquired control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Groupe Victoire</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , after a takeover battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Industrielle</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-September</TIMEX> .
     But he estimated that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> would have been able to amass <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 4 %</NUMEX> of the shares in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> .
     Aside from exploring plans for joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> or acquisitions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> has called top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> rumored as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">raiders</ENAMEX> -- among them , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union des Assurances de Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suez</ENAMEX> , all based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> would find it hard to crack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> 's battlements .
     A `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicate</ENAMEX> '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> said , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have agreed to give one another the right of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> refusal should they sell any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> shares .
     Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Generale de Belgique</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asahi</ENAMEX> , the syndicate includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , and various family interests .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Generale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> confirmed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would be willing to raise its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> should a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> seek control .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asahi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment .
     Even without bid talk , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's surge in prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> real estate has excited interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AG</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> says those holdings constitute the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-biggest real-estate portfolio in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Belgium</ENAMEX> .

     With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the many lingering questions the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> will ponder is this : Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Council</ENAMEX> staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lt. Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> , came into office in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> intent on making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tower Commission</ENAMEX> , which investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> affair .
     He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> had spun out of control and nearly wrecked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term .
     So , following both the style he pursued as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> 's national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> and the recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tower Commission</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> has pruned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> ; serving as an honest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> in distilling that information for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tower Commission</ENAMEX> specifically said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">self-starters</ENAMEX> '' like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lt. Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> strike out on their own rather than leaving the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> execution of policies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> episode has raised questions about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy on tough issues .
     During the coup attempt and its aftermath , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> were `` stretched very thin , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">shop</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> does n't plan to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> right now , but is weighing that possibility , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> adds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gaffney </ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Center for Security Policy</ENAMEX> , a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">think-tank</ENAMEX> .
     `` The problem with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , I think , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Council</ENAMEX> itself was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1947</TIMEX> because policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">makers</ENAMEX> sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     By law , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> of state and defense .
     In practice , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of central intelligence and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> also serve as unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     But the size , shape and role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> have been left for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and his national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to decide .
     That task is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's perennial problems .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> , the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> is down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 70</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say .
     Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> insist that the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was n't a problem during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> crisis .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clear problem during the coup attempt was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> most experienced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett Briggs</ENAMEX> , was gone .
     He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Aronson</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> and support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> .
     The absence of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> underscored the possible inadequacy of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX> , are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> affairs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> is particularly well-versed in arms control , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> studying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> politics and society .
     Both have become confidants of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     But neither has an extensive background in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Middle East</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> .
     In those areas , the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> under them therefore have become more important .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaus</ENAMEX> .
     But just as every previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> has , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> now will have to mull at what point the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> becomes too lean and too restrained .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bureaucrats</ENAMEX> may deserve their bad reputation , after all .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Lesko</ENAMEX> , something of a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defender</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , thought he had a sure-fire winner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> when he offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> for the best `` verifiable story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> words or less about how a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> helped you . ''
     He sent out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of news releases from his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kensington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     He plugged the contest on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry King</ENAMEX> 's radio show , on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Sajak</ENAMEX> 's television show and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C-SPAN</ENAMEX> cable television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     He talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> promoting his books , which dispense handy how-to advice on using government information for fun and profit .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> figured he would be flooded with entries by now .
     After all , he says , `` we 've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like 15 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> . ''
     And in addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> , he has promised the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">My Favorite Bureaucrat</ENAMEX> '' plaque and offered each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners-up</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500</NUMEX> .
     So far , though , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> has received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> entry .
     To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> : A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">New York State Department of Taxation and Finance</ENAMEX> who nominated her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> are eligible for nomination by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> .
     But he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank-and-file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> .
     He admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Newspapers</ENAMEX> , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases .
     Talk show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> quickly change the topic .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest .
     `` Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> not helping anybody ? '' asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni Murray</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> hate to write , '' he says .
     `` Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't believe I want to give this money away . ''
     Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are just so annoyed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> that they are n't interested in admitting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> come in handy once in a while .
     If he sponsored a contest on how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> mishandled something , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> admits , `` I 'd get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> entries . ''
     Now there 's an idea .

     With the collapse of the talks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to intensify its pursuit of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> , which is scrambling to fend off a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> bid by negotiating a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">archrival</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ally</ENAMEX> to shore up its sagging car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> it `` has had and will continue to have contacts with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> . ''
     Among the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitors</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat S.p . A</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> side of the negotiations said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> that the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> lost interest as it became clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> originally had seen a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> as a way to expand its presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> luxury car markets .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     But the talks on a heavy truck <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> apparently did n't go far .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> 's highly profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scania</ENAMEX> truck <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> balked at surrendering any of their autonomy .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> 's problems were underscored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> announced that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 billion kronor</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 186.1 million</NUMEX> -RRB- loss during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first eight months of this year</TIMEX> , slightly worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab-Scania</ENAMEX> had forecast in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first-half</TIMEX> report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     Overall , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab-Scania</ENAMEX> 's pretax profit during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first eight months of the year</TIMEX> plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.9 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 billion Swedish kronor</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155.1 million</NUMEX> -RRB- from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.96 billion kronor</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 303.9 million</NUMEX> -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> said the most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> now is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> have worked together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past</TIMEX> , in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">9000</ENAMEX> model , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Croma</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lancia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Thema</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab-Scania</ENAMEX> Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg Karnsund</ENAMEX> said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has had talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> about a broader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> .
     But the talks yielded `` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , '' he said .
     As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> play will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> for a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> .
     The failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> talks `` makes it even more crucial for -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> -RCB- to be victorious '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> contest , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> auto industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UBS-Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> faces an uphill fight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , however .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> they expect to have a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> wrapped up by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , is hosting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">British Parliament</ENAMEX> who are touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> 's headquarter operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the visit is n't connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> situation .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> clearly views <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> as a prize worth fighting for , since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's gilded brand image would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">four-year-old</TIMEX> effort to market its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>-built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> as a luxury import under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> brand name .
     So despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> romance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> had boosted its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> holding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 11 %</NUMEX> of the luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> 's shares outstanding from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early last week</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 5.4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares changed hands in active trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's stock exchange <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares moved up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 pence</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">696 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11</NUMEX> -RRB- .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Falcons</ENAMEX> .
     Up in his stadium <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">box</ENAMEX> , their new and controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerral `` Jerry '' Jones</ENAMEX> , watches anxiously as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> bounds up to the scrimmage line .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> takes heart .
     There in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the pack is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Troy Aikman</ENAMEX> , the key to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> ' comeback strategy .
     So key , in fact , that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> signed him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.4 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next six years</TIMEX> -- a record for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rookie</ENAMEX> .
     `` He 's a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Wheaties</ENAMEX>-box <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> , '' gushes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones </ENAMEX>.
     With <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX> left on the clock , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikman</ENAMEX> takes the snap , steps back and fires a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">21-yard</NUMEX> pass -- straight into the hands of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Atlanta</ENAMEX> defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">back</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> groans , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> shakes his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> lose the game .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">A few days</TIMEX> after that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 17</TIMEX> game , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikman</ENAMEX> broke a finger , sidelining him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> .
     Ah , the glamour of professional sports .
     For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> , losing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> -- and , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Football League</ENAMEX> .
     Once fat and happy , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> now are losing games , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> and money .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> ended up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</NUMEX> in the red on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> in revenue .
     It has some of the highest costs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> .
     Its attendance is off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six years ago</TIMEX> .
     At the very least , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> , who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench , can take comfort in one fact : <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">These days</TIMEX> , he is n't alone .
     Nearly half the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Football League</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadiums</ENAMEX> and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikman </ENAMEX>.
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> took home an average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 536,000</NUMEX> , a figure comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and higher than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-round draft picks have done even better : Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 685,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's a vicious circle , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Modell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Browns</ENAMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> pays so much and the other pays more .
     We just do n't have that kind of income stream . ''
     All this is causing convulsions in professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Owners</ENAMEX> , largely complacent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past</TIMEX> , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue -- embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process .
     Though not intentionally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> ' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> has come to represent this new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> .
     Shortly after buying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.R. `` Bum '' Bright</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 million</NUMEX> , and mindful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> ' ragged bottom line , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">47-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> set about his own round of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> cuts .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , he unceremoniously sacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Landry</ENAMEX> , the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> who took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Super Bowls</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> consecutive winning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasons</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landry</ENAMEX> has a standing just shy of sainthood .
     Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> sentiment flooded the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> : `` A crude obnoxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hick</ENAMEX> , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> ; `` a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oink</ENAMEX> , '' said another ; `` Who in the hell does he think he is ? '' wrote a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> .
     For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> , it was just the beginning .
     He quickly cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's bloated administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> , shut down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX>-owned dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">academy</ENAMEX> and , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , announced plans to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Valley Ranch</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">30-acre</NUMEX> practice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">camp</ENAMEX> and the most lavish training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ranch</ENAMEX> `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> of Sportdom . ''
     It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">maze</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">halls</ENAMEX> that connects film <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> , elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spas</ENAMEX> and weight-training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> that testify to a richer , more free-spending era .
     He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ranch</ENAMEX> during an early visit , took refuge in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> and called the front desk for help .
     `` I said , ` Somebody come get me .
     I 'm at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">extension 29</ENAMEX> . ' ''
     With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a new day</TIMEX> dawning on the sport , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> does n't see a place for this sort of luxury .
     `` It 's just not cost efficient , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">place</ENAMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 2 million</NUMEX> a year to maintain .
     When he sells it , he says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">field</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> .
     And as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Landry </ENAMEX>, well , in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> 's mind , he had played out his winning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> .
     After posting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">losing seasons</TIMEX> in each of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last three years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> needed a change , he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Football</ENAMEX> has long been Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> 's passion , both on and off the field .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> , he started at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> on the undefeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1964</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> that won a national championship .
     After college , he worked at his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> 's insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Little Rock </ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1966</TIMEX> led an aborted attempt to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chargers</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Years later</TIMEX> , with cash from the sale of the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , he founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arkoma Production Corp.</ENAMEX> , an oil and gas exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Little Rock</ENAMEX> .
     So it was n't surprising that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> roots when he went looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landry </ENAMEX>.
     He tapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Johnson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teammate</ENAMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1964</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">squad</ENAMEX> and the head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Miami</ENAMEX> , where he led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Hurricanes</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> winning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">seasons</TIMEX> and a national championship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Whatever Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , he is no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Landry </ENAMEX>.
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> games -LRB- and , after a loss to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kansas City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chiefs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> losses -RRB- into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the season</TIMEX> , the `` new '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> are n't doing any better than the old .
     In fact , the last time they played this badly was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> , their opening season .
     Average attendance at their games , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 49,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , continues flat .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> is attacking the problem on several fronts .
     He continues to reshuffle the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , trading famed running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">back</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herschel Walker</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Vikings</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> for a slew of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> and future draft picks .
     To try to draw more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19</NUMEX> .
     But the general trend , given rising costs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> , has been to raise prices , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> is expected to eventually follow suit .
     `` It 's simple , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Hunt</ENAMEX> , who owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kansas City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chiefs</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> raised ticket prices by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.40</NUMEX> to an average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17</NUMEX> .
     `` If we did n't increase prices , we 'd be in the red . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> has also beefed up his marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to sell the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suites</ENAMEX> topping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> -LRB- his deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bum Bright</ENAMEX> included operating rights for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suites</ENAMEX> are air-conditioned , have wet bars and plush seating , and offer a clear view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">field</ENAMEX> -- all for a sale price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 475,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> , depending on their size and location .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> has been taking prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> , and promises those who actually buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> 's look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> 's strategy before game time .
     The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suites</ENAMEX> had been sold .
     Today , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> have .
     Gate receipts are only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest source of cash .
     The biggest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> 's contract with national television for broadcast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> 's games .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> ' share of that pie came to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.6 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> additionally earns <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 2 million and $ 4 million</NUMEX> for local radio and television broadcast rights .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights .
     He is also trying to get more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> have a following , to pick up the games .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> who works <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days</TIMEX> , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> '' and has played his part in the bidding wars .
     Besides signing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikman</ENAMEX> to a sizable contract , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> has agreed to pay rookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Walsh </ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.1 million</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next four years</TIMEX> .
     This wage inflation is bleeding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> dry , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> contend .
     Soon , only large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> will be able to afford to buy and run football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Veatch Jr.</ENAMEX> , an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> who handled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> sale .
     To tackle the problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries .
     Details of the plan , which would go into effect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> , are sketchy , but each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability .
     Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL Players Association</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , and that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are in financial trouble because of poor business management , not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> ' salaries .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are trying to boost profit in other ways , too .
     Many have launched promotions to attract new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts .
     Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> must pay up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of gross ticket sales for leases on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadiums</ENAMEX> they say are either too small or too old .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , for example , size is the issue .
     `` We have the worst lease in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> , '' contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael B. McCaskey</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Chicago Bears</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Halas</ENAMEX> , who founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> 's predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're in a metro area with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Bear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> , and only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> can be accommodated . ''
     When the lease expires in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1999</TIMEX> , he says , `` It 's got to be changed . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> also imposed an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-player limit on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">teams</ENAMEX> going into training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">camp</ENAMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> , in a move meant to trim payroll costs .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> is trying to get more for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> national network contract , which expires after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this season</TIMEX> .
     The current contract pays the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Owners</ENAMEX> say they expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> to demand a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> also says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">league</ENAMEX> will probably expand its offerings to cable TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ESPN</ENAMEX> .
     The changes have n't come easy .
     Like the game of professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> itself is in turmoil .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> of team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> included , has been fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> , almost all of them new , blocked an effort to install <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Finks</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> for retiring league <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Rozelle</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finks</ENAMEX> is perceived by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> as a standard-bearer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Guard</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX> , another effort to choose a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> failed .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> meet again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     For his part , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Jones</ENAMEX> says he 's in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that .
     He puts in busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-day weeks</TIMEX> -LRB- excluding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">game days</TIMEX> -RRB- , and on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one recent afternoon</TIMEX> fielded questions , in the course of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> , from a TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> , his luxury-suite marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , a disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and a roomful of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     To keep his schedule on track , he flies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> in from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Little Rock</ENAMEX> to augment his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> .
     `` When I made this investment , I made it on a lifetime basis , '' he explains .
     `` I 'm not here to make money by reselling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> later on .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> may not be the best investment now , I do n't accept they ca n't be in the future . ''
     Besides , to a large extent , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> may already be getting what he wants out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , even though it keeps losing .
     Owning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cowboys</ENAMEX> has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> just did n't provide .
     There is the new private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jet</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">platoon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Prime Time Live</ENAMEX> . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few weeks ago</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> even entertained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX> in his private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">suite</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> .

     How interestingly clever of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Goldberg</ENAMEX> to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Days of Rage</ENAMEX> '' in his television critique -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leisure & Arts</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept 11</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     He chastises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jo Franklin-Trout</ENAMEX> for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as `` intellectually slipshod . ''
     Was not the title very clear ?
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example he gives : `` She did n't ask '' -LRB- why the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> throwing stones -RRB- .
     Really now , did she have to ask ?
     Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> contends that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> view .
     Of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> complain about their treatment ; of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> feel put upon .
     But his complaint that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Days of Rage</ENAMEX> '' does n't contain balanced comments from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> about how badly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> are behaving is irrelevant .
     It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Africans</ENAMEX> are .
     This film did emphasize how long the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>\/<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War I</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> tried to guarantee both a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> without specifying how it was to be done .
     Well , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Days of Rage</ENAMEX> '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning .
     Every issue is multisided .
     This film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media .
     Now we must endure a rash of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> who apparently wish to know details of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side only .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to raise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> the amount of money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> may shift among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> budget law was intended to inflict .
     If the request is approved by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would need only permission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> to move the money , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     That would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> flexibility that no other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> has .
     `` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn .</ENAMEX> -RRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> , who said he would oppose the request .
     `` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> is supposed to impose , '' he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's request did n't indicate how Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would shift the money .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Budget</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> structured the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.1 billion</NUMEX> spending reduction , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
     That would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     Under the deficit-reduction law , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> 's money and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</NUMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> ' money has been canceled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit-cutting measure has been signed into law .

     A bill that would permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to monitor the financial condition of securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> ' holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .
     The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to disclose large trades and give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> additional authority during market emergencies .
     However , he recently told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> that he believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker-dealers</ENAMEX> , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans .
     The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions .
     Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> about the risks associated with Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> issuing bridge loans .
     But some Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> argue that such fears are unwarranted .
     In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 6</TIMEX> letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> argued that the fact that no retail brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> failed during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , whose holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX> , is one of the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> of bridge loans on Wall Street , said it is also concerned that once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has the power to monitor holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , it will try to regulate their activities .
     `` The proposal , while well-intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has exercised for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">50 years</TIMEX> over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Raoul-Duval</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , said in an interview .
     The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raoul-Duval</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> in the industry and on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's concerns may be possible .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> says some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward O'Brien</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX> , said that the securities-industry trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's goals .

     This letter was inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Asman</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 25</TIMEX> editorial-page article about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking</ENAMEX> . ''
     I 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> .
     In any matters between us and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> art and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> , but also with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort .
     There is a simple reason for this : the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate .
     Those `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> , even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of Culture</ENAMEX> , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Cuban Revolution</ENAMEX> , spelled out in terms such as equality among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
     In fact , the generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che Guevara</ENAMEX> 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest .
     It is on behalf of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asman</ENAMEX> 's opinions of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ochoa</ENAMEX> trial in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> .
     However , unacceptable though those occurrences may have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asman</ENAMEX> should make distinctions among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     They are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances .
     It is naivete to equate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's policies with the will of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> -LRB- as we well know -RRB- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">military</ENAMEX> and the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asman</ENAMEX> is also annoyed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> has resisted collaboration with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> , such as facilitating defections .
     I think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel</ENAMEX> does n't invite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> to violate the jurisdiction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> over its own territory .
     We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom .
     Without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Cuba</ENAMEX> will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 years</TIMEX> .
     From my own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> excel , we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .
     There is no rational justification for such behavior .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 50 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> general obligation bonds were put up for sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> alone .
     While that represents a small percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's public debt outstanding , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 've never seen so many -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> -RCB- G.O. 's up for sale , '' said another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     `` Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> has blocks of every size and maturity . ''
     Municipal bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's financial health , rumors of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</NUMEX> bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two weeks</TIMEX> , before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> mayoral election .
     -LRB- General obligation bonds are backed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's overall revenues and credit . -RRB-
     Although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold .
     The fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">issuers</ENAMEX> of tax-exempt bonds , sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> of municipal bonds just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     There have been reports for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's economy is weakening , as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> stock market crash continues to make itself felt .
     The recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns .
     Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's spending needs are expanding .
     Rumors persisted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's credit ratings -- single-A from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> and single-A-minus from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> -- are at risk .
     The weakness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> bonds follows a warning from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Regan</ENAMEX> that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash seriously weakened the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's economy .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor</ENAMEX> of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Lonesome Dove</ENAMEX> , '' said it filed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> protection after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> failed to provide it with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> owed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> in connection with the distribution of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The New Leave It to Beaver Show</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 %</NUMEX> owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> and said it relies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for funding its working capital requirements .
     After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> stock sank <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.625</NUMEX> in over-the-counter trading to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> on heavy volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.4 million</NUMEX> shares .

     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> payment was due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> and the deadline for default was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX> said if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> had defaulted it could have been required to repay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 92 million</NUMEX> in debt under its loan agreements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> said that as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The New Leave It to Beaver</ENAMEX> '' as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> properties .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> was `` saying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as recently as last weekend</TIMEX> that they would take care of the situation .
     They continued to represent that to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd </ENAMEX>.
     `` We were reassured they would stand behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX> said both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to make the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lender</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 14</TIMEX> .
     At that point , he said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing .
     However a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment .
     In a prepared statement from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also said that , following the breakdown of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM</ENAMEX> talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> and a substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> in excess of that previously made .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> added that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> filing .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means .
     The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a shocker , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Di Lillo </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drake Capital Securities</ENAMEX> , a brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that has an investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> was `` going to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , resigned because his participation in evaluating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's role in buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> was no longer necessary .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and a predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     The announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> might be revived .
     It 's understood that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MGM\/UA</ENAMEX> recently contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> , which made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> failed bids for the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> , to see if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was still interested .
     However , `` we are n't currently doing anything .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> strongly denied playing any role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stock-price free fall .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makoto Utsumi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice minister</ENAMEX> for international affairs , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> did n't in any way suggest to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> that they stay out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> leveraged buy-out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> has never even suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> said .
     `` There are no facts -LCB- behind the assertions -RCB- that we sent any kind of signal , '' he declared in an interview .
     The comments were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> 's concern that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> will think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets .
     A number of accounts of the events leading to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> point drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stock prices on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> of pulling the plug on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason or another .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> said the most the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> had ever done was ask <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> about `` the status of their participation '' in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> previous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> leveraged buy-out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> inquired about that deal -- which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> declined to identify -- because the large presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . ''
     He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> also said some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> were willing to participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out .
     In general , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals .
     `` Each <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -LCB- UAL -RCB- deal , '' he said .
     `` They are becoming more independent .
     It 's a sound phenomenon . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sanwa Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> that decided not to participate in the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> proposal .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sanwa Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> denied that the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> played any part in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's decision .
     `` We made our own decision , '' he said .
     Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsumi</ENAMEX> may have a hard time convincing market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">All week</TIMEX> there has been much speculation in financial circles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and abroad about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> 's real position .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have been growing increasingly concerned during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few months</TIMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> getting in over their heads .
     `` The -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> -RCB- thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> do n't know what they are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foreign bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> who asked not to be identified .
     `` The -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">ministry</ENAMEX> -RCB- wants to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added .
     Although some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> involved in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> proposed bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are under `` political pressure '' as well , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> .
     Clearly , some financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are concerned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> role in leveraged buy-outs .
     At a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satoshi Sumita</ENAMEX> cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .
     Despite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumita</ENAMEX> 's statements , it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> , not the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , that makes policy decisions .
     While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are n't likely to walk away from the game .
     Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to increase their presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     Flush with cash at home , but with fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to lend to , leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are eager to expand overseas .
     Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's national tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gauloises</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gitanes</ENAMEX> , is branching out .
     Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> .
     Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">tobacco</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">tobacco</ENAMEX> , used in so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-style cigarettes .
     `` We are n't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertrand de Galle </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of government-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A.</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> .
     He says that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> has done .
     -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> 's net profit soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">150 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">461.6 million French francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 73.5 million</NUMEX> -RRB- on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FFr 27.68 billion</NUMEX> - a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> profit margin . -RRB-
     Instead , he said in an interview , he is looking for ways to exploit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's network of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,000</NUMEX> tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agents</ENAMEX> , most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">cafes</ENAMEX> .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> does n't own the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">tabacs</ENAMEX> , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities .
     One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> .
     Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     Once activated , the card would sit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> 's window , showing traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wardens</ENAMEX> how much time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorist</ENAMEX> could remain .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorist</ENAMEX> returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the project , which was developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra SA</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> technology .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matra</ENAMEX> currently are negotiating with city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for the right to begin service .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> is considering further diversification .
     It wanted to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> cracker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Belin</ENAMEX> , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , but lost the bidding to food group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BSN SA</ENAMEX> .
     It currently is considering bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Swedish Match Co</ENAMEX> .
     And it retains an interest in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">candies</ENAMEX> and other articles that might be sold in tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     It also is trying to shore up its tobacco business .
     Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gauloises</ENAMEX> now make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 40 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> tobacco market , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about two decades ago</TIMEX> .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> retains a manufacturing monopoly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand .
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seita</ENAMEX> has introduced blonde cigarettes under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gauloises</ENAMEX> label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gitanes Blondes</ENAMEX> in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Gitanes</ENAMEX> .
     The aim , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Galle</ENAMEX> , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> .

     The decision , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Reproductive Health Services</ENAMEX> , illustrates how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> reinstated the preamble of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> abortion law .
     The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have rights protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , a federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .
     The high court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> said it was up to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws .
     Already , local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> have relied on the restored preamble in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> who blocked access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Reproductive Health Services</ENAMEX> , an abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clinic</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     Under a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> law , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> or private injury . ''
     Relying on the preamble 's statement that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is an unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">St. Louis County Circuit Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> accepted the justification that the abortion clinic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> were trying to save lives .
     In another case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann O'Brien</ENAMEX> , was convicted of trespass before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> ruling .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , when her appeal was argued before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Missouri Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> , her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> also relied on the preamble .
     `` The effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> , and I think this is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the cracks , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Belz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who represented Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> decision that recognized a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's right to abortion .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Mandina</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Kansas City Lawyers for Life</ENAMEX> , says that if abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> .
     There 's no risk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> , and you ca n't keep an abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clinic</ENAMEX> open if there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> standing outside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">every day</TIMEX> . ''
     That would be an ironic result of a case in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> expressly stopped short of overruling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade </ENAMEX>.
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other cases , the possible consequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling appear even more unintended .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">20-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mo.</ENAMEX> , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> should be treated as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">21-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , those caught drinking and driving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">between the ages of 16 and 21</TIMEX> may have their licenses revoked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> , while those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">21</TIMEX> or older suffer only a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-day</TIMEX> suspension .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Boone County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> rejected the motion , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Dodson</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jefferson City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , says he has appealed .
     And in a case filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> is arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are wrongfully imprisoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> of a pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who is in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> for theft and forgery .

     In terms of sheer brutality , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Somali</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Siad Barre</ENAMEX> may rank as No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the world .
     The only reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spread out over an expanse nearly the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">dictatorship</ENAMEX> simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill .
     Beheading small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , stabbing elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to death , raping and shooting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> , and burying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Somali</ENAMEX> armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> have been engaged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">over the past two years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Somalis</ENAMEX> have escaped to the relative safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> because of the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> .
     In the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera</ENAMEX> , for example , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Issak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> were rounded up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1988</TIMEX> , imprisoned , and then taken out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five to 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">Guns</ENAMEX> were never used : Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was stabbed to death with a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">knife</ENAMEX> .
     The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of interviews with randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> .
     The study was done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gersony</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide .
     What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> on the horn of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Africa</ENAMEX> .
     Not since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">just the past few weeks</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's rule is crumbling fast .
     Mutinies wrack his armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> -LRB- really just an armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> -RRB- , which control less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Inflation is at record levels .
     Desperate , he has called in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Libyans</ENAMEX> to help fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Somali National Movement</ENAMEX> in the north , which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> picking away at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mogadishu</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">Seventy years old</TIMEX> and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> has a power base , composed only of his minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mareham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> , that according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> is `` narrowing . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> consists of a single runway at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> have the right to use for surveillance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Gulf of Aden</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> .
     That strip of concrete is backed up by a few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-story , air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">shacks</ENAMEX> where a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> -- buttressed by imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , cold soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">drinks</ENAMEX> and back issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sports Illustrated</ENAMEX> -- maintain radio contact with the outside world .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control .
     As long as the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu Haile Mariam</ENAMEX> held a total gridlock over neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> was forced to accept that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lonely</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berbera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">runway</ENAMEX> as a distant No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' array of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airfields</ENAMEX> next door .
     But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> , those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">bases</ENAMEX> may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">runway</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 7</TIMEX> , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Eritrean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Tigrean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> .
     Recently , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wollo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Tigrean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> have killed , wounded and captured an additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of deaths in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> of little strategic importance ! -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Tigrean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> are now <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">200 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addis Ababa</ENAMEX> , threatening the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dese</ENAMEX> , which would cut off Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">capital</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Assab</ENAMEX> , through which all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> and other supplies reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Addis Ababa</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> has been forced to transfer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Eritrea</ENAMEX> just to hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Eritrea</ENAMEX> only to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Tigreans</ENAMEX> at bay .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> is in an increasingly weak position : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> is tied down defending the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Asmara</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Eritreans</ENAMEX> .
     The weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> for help .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Tigreans</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX> , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Eritreans</ENAMEX> they are among the most anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> in the world , having suffered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a decade</TIMEX> of aerial bombardment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">force</ENAMEX> .
     What this all means in shorthand is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> dominance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> is collapsing as fast as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> is .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> and to undo the superpower flip-flop of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Horn of Africa</ENAMEX> .
     Back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> :
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> , evinced by its decision to publish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gersony</ENAMEX> report -LRB- which the press has ignored -RRB- .
     What 's more , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has suspended <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.5 million</NUMEX> in military aid and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> in economic aid .
     But this is not enough .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is still perceived to be tied to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> , when he goes the runway could go too .
     Considering how tenuous the security of that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">runway</ENAMEX> is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> to blast the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Somalis</ENAMEX> to understand .
     It is a certainty that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">days</TIMEX> are numbered .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> should take care , however , that its own position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> does not go down with him .
     Nobody is sure what will come next in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia</ENAMEX> or whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> might be .
     But as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> tells me : `` Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> . ''
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> positions itself for the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> period in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Somalia </ENAMEX>, it should continue to back former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> 's well-intentioned role as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Eritrean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ethiopia </ENAMEX>, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Tigrean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> through neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Sudan</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Byzantine</ENAMEX> in all of black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Africa</ENAMEX> .
     Remember that it took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many months</TIMEX> , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haile Selassie</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> .
     There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> has one great advantage : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Soviets</ENAMEX> are universally loathed throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> for what they did to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this past decade</TIMEX> -- famine and all .
     It 's not just in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> where the march of events is finally on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> side , but on the horn of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Africa</ENAMEX> as well .
     The only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> liability in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">region</ENAMEX> is what remains of the link to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre </ENAMEX>, and that should be cut fast .
