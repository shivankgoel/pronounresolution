     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">buses</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,120,317</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> because of a slip in exports , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Japan Automobile Manufacturers ' Association</ENAMEX> said .
     Domestic demand continues to grow , but its contribution to higher production was sapped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> by the estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> fall in imports , accompanied by a growing tendency for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> to build vehicles overseas , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> said domestic demand grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of pro-consumption government policies , an association <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     He also said the introduction of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> consumption tax in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> has helped sales .
     The new tax , though a source of general resentment among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> , replaced a higher commodities tax that applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">automobiles</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> domestic motor-vehicle sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> will issue statistics on vehicle exports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this month</TIMEX> .
     Production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> rose to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">801,835</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Midsized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> accounted for the greatest growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> , rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,872</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134,550</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88 %</NUMEX> .
     Minicar output more than tripled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,835</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> -- which have engines of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">500 cubic centimeters or less</NUMEX> -- an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,777</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> .
     Total truck production fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315,546</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> .
     Minitruck production fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94,243</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> .
     Bus production also slipped , by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,936</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> .
     The association <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said bus production has declined since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , but could n't offer an explanation for the fall .
     Auto production for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the fiscal year</TIMEX> , which began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,379,884</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> said .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Half-year</TIMEX> production was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4 %</NUMEX> compared with the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     Stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> gyrated wildly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> amid speculation that one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision , announced after the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , initially prompted a severe sell-off in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares , which at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> traded as low as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33</NUMEX> a share , in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     The deepening bloodbath for takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , who by then had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock tumble <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 12</TIMEX> , also triggered a marketwide sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 80</NUMEX> points at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:40 a.m</TIMEX> .
     But then steady , concentrated buying by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , which frequently buys stock for corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">raiders</ENAMEX> , took hold and steadied the fall in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , which eventually buoyed the entire market .
     The industrial average closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3.69</NUMEX> points at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2659.22</NUMEX> .
     Late in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , several big purchases by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns </ENAMEX>, particularly a block of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> shares at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:43 p.m.</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150</NUMEX> a share , triggered a buying spree that took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 18</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final hour</TIMEX> of trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.375</NUMEX> .
     Volume was a tumultuous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9 million</NUMEX> shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.8 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares outstanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns</ENAMEX> bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1 million</NUMEX> shares .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most frequently rumored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> , neither of whom would comment , were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston Partners</ENAMEX> , which battled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> , who recently made and withdrew an offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp .</ENAMEX>
     However , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> said the signs pointed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> has n't asked for permission to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 million</NUMEX> of stock under federal antitrust rules .
     Takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , stung by their huge losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock , remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> labor-management buy-out .
     Their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> in a solicitation of shareholder consents .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nye Investments</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock , would n't comment on reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is considering seeking such a shareholder vote .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nye</ENAMEX> said , `` This is the most extraordinary failed transaction I 've seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">25 years</TIMEX> in this business .
     It would make sense for somebody to do it .
     I have never seen a case of incompetence shared by so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nye</ENAMEX> waged a proxy fight for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leaseway Transportation Inc.</ENAMEX> that ultimately led to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leaseway</ENAMEX> 's being sold .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> , that recapitalizations could yield <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 245 to $ 280</NUMEX> a share .
     But those would require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' cooperation .
     Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who acquires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's contentious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> are working under an expired contract , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> contract expires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> .
     That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose .
     However , a catalyst like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> at the last price discussed by that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> before the board meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had been working on a buy-out bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 225 and $ 240</NUMEX> a share , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision to avoid `` rushing around selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share offer just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     Even some takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said they could n't quarrel with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's logic .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     `` We had a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who threw in the towel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Ellis </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Benjamin Jacobson &amp; Sons</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> noted that many arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are afraid to sell their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock at the bottom , but already own so much they ca n't buy any more .
     `` This deal is like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Roach Motel</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     `` They check in , but they ca n't check out . ''
     But both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> remain interested in some transaction .
     So too , according to many reports , is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> , despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> might end up teaming up with their longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">adversaries</ENAMEX> , the machinists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> , in a recapitalization .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> are reviewing proposals they made in the past for recapitalizations that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> a minority stake .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> rejected those past proposals .
     It is unclear , however , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> would support a majority stake , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> want .
     A machinist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said that would depend on how much in concessions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> would have to give in return for the majority stake .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> whose names were bandied about by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> said they were n't buying .
     `` I 'm not interested , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Simmons</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> , a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> who owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX> , said he has n't owned any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock and is n't buying .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass</ENAMEX> said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves .
     And a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> , which had held <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> , would n't comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> , whose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.4 billion</NUMEX> takeover bid originally put the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> in play , is limited by a standstill agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> he signed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> ca n't buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock , solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX> a share or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> accepts an offer below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX> .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> could pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> by asking that the agreement be waived , or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price .

     Copper futures sold off sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar , and a rally in bonds .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> opened near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's close , tried to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1510</NUMEX> a pound , off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.50 cents</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     Stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kaiser </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaiser Financial Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , said the decline was almost certainly influenced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early</TIMEX> sell-off in the stock market , which partly reflected a weakening economy .
     He said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two to three weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     But though a weakening economy implies reduced demand , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser</ENAMEX> said that Third World copper-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> have n't any choice but to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> .
     They might even step up sales in a falling market , he said , in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries .
     Technically , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser</ENAMEX> noted that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> had bought into the market when the price was in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.24 to $ 1.26</NUMEX> range , thinking there was support at the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.20</NUMEX> level .
     When the market fell below that level on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> could n't climb above that level , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> started selling out their positions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Raptopoulos</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature .
     She said the market hit the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.18</NUMEX> level at around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders .
     More stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.14</NUMEX> , where modest buying was attracted .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raptopoulos</ENAMEX> said the settling of strikes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> will have little effect on supplies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     She thinks the next area of support for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> is in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.09</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.10</NUMEX> range .
     `` I believe that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.20</NUMEX> region , '' she added .
     She thinks a recovery in the stock market would help <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> rebound as well .
     She noted that the preliminary estimate of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> gross national product is due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> and is expected to be up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2.5 % to 3 %</NUMEX> .
     `` If the number is a little better , then <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raptopoulos</ENAMEX> noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , for example , `` the durable goods numbers came out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> and the number was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.1 %</NUMEX> , '' she said .
     `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> .
     I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ''
     She said <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Threlkeld</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Threlkeld &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , an international metals company , noted that so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , and that projected production is below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Threlkeld</ENAMEX> said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> , with declining use being the result .
     `` But , '' he added , `` we have had that exact same perception <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last six years</TIMEX> . ''
     He noted that currently the ratio of available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> to consumption is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about 3.5 weeks</TIMEX> .
     He said the normal ratio is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five to six weeks</TIMEX> .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Threlkeld</ENAMEX> , the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> but at the copper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries</ENAMEX> .
     `` It takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> to turn copper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">concentrate</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">cathodes</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     If there is n't a recession , he said , `` we will be out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of March</TIMEX> .
     If there is a recession that will change the statistical situation . ''
     He thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.65</NUMEX> a pound , which was reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     In the past Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Threlkeld</ENAMEX> has been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market .
     In other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> :
     ENERGY : The attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude oil futures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Prices for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents</NUMEX> lower at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.72</NUMEX> a barrel for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> said the petroleum market was ready to rally after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two days</TIMEX> of price declines from profit-taking .
     But an early <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stopped the crude rally cold .
     The industrial average recovered to close <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3.69</NUMEX> points lower , but petroleum futures never shook off the chill .
     Most market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> said they were looking to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's inventory statistics from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Petroleum Institute</ENAMEX> to give the market some direction .
     The report is n't generally available until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> .
     PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.20</NUMEX> an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 373.40</NUMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.7 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.1950</NUMEX> an ounce .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.30</NUMEX> an ounce to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 488.60</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser</ENAMEX> said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets .
     He noted that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> there were rumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> sales of precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> to finance grain purchases , but the sales do n't seem to have materialized .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raptopoulos</ENAMEX> thought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Gold</ENAMEX> still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , she said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> was more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> times the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> at the close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , which is historically high .
     `` The high ratio reflects the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> is still regarded as about a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metal</ENAMEX> and its price lagging relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">GRAINS</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SOYBEANS</ENAMEX> : Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather .
     The sale to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">330,000 metric tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Gustafson</ENAMEX> , a futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     As for other export <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is n't expected to be back buying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> in significant amounts until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> , he said .
     A number of commercial grain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> buttressed that opinion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> by buying certain corn options for delivery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> , indicating to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> that the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would use the options to hedge against expected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year 's first quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">COCOA</ENAMEX> : Futures at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> continued the rally begun on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , but then faltered and closed lower .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract opened just under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's close , triggered some previously placed buy orders just above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,030</NUMEX> a metric ton , pushing the price to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,040</NUMEX> , and then encountered heavy selling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">interests</ENAMEX> .
     The contract settled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,014</NUMEX> a ton , off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hafer</ENAMEX> , senior commodities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kaiser Financial Group</ENAMEX> , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's rally continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only about 20 minutes</TIMEX> after the opening .
     He said even though there was arbitrage buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> because of the weak dollar , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> fell to relentless pressure from bearish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     But he noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract reached its life-of-contract low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 975</NUMEX> a ton on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 11</TIMEX> ; its lifetime high was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,735</NUMEX> , set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , and its recent high was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,368</NUMEX> , set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early August</TIMEX> .
     The last time <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> traded at prices as low as currently was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> .
     But while further modest declines might be ahead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hafer</ENAMEX> said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's high .

     Next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</ENAMEX> 's megabillion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> deal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI Television</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">small fry</ENAMEX> .
     But the troubles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> , especially the asset-stripping game .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , which expects to release a plan to restructure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> of debt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next day</TIMEX> or so , is n't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that .
     The cable and TV station <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was an LBO of an LBO , a set of assets that were leveraged twice , enabling the blue-chip buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> to take more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> of cash out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">com - pany</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's buy-out was an ace in the hole for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> .
     But it has left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">holders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's junk bonds holding the bag , including some heavyweights that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> might need to finance future deals , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Savings &amp; Loan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> are said to be considering legal action against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> or moves to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR </ENAMEX>'s majority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's buy-out , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nashville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gillett</ENAMEX> , also is said to be very unhappy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> once were part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer Communications</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> loaded up the cable and television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with debt in an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> buy-out , then later sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer</ENAMEX> 's cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> at a fat profit .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time piled debt onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer</ENAMEX> 's TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> , selling them for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entity</ENAMEX> that was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillett Corp.</ENAMEX> , which now operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> .
     In this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LBO , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> with one hand took <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> of cash out of the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's assets and moved it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer</ENAMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , making them more valuable in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> sale .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer</ENAMEX> also took <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125 million</NUMEX> of junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds as partial payment for the TV assets . -RRB-
     With the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> put back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 %</NUMEX> of the cash it had taken out , buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> common and preferred shares .
     So , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 250 million sunk</NUMEX> in now-shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , including equity and debt , the LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> still is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> ahead on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> buy-out after taking cash up front .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer</ENAMEX> as a whole , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> racked up compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> returns of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the three years</TIMEX> it owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Storer</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> risks losing his entire equity investment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> ca n't be restructured .
     Overall , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett </ENAMEX>'s holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillett Holdings</ENAMEX> , is heavily indebted and , except for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Vail Mountain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">resorts</ENAMEX> , is n't doing very well .
     With the TV business falling on hard times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> had to be liquidated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , it might fetch <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> less than in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> buy-out , wiping out most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can barely pay its cash interest bill , and to stay out of bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 16</TIMEX> .
     It now is quietly circulating among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">creditors</ENAMEX> a preliminary plan to restructure debt .
     Negotiations `` have started con - structively , but that 's not to say we like this particular offer , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rothschild Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> .
     No major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> deal will talk publicly .
     But it 's understood that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> is disappointed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> did n't manage to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's operating profit after the buy-out .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> apparently thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can survive if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> extend its debt payments until TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> rise in value again , allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to sell assets to pay debt .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stations</ENAMEX> ' ratings and turned around a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> .
     As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR </ENAMEX>.
     The bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> now are being quoted at prices ranging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">from only five cents to about 60 cents</NUMEX> on the dollar , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.D. Smith &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , which trades distressed securities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who have seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillett Corp</ENAMEX> .
     They would both give part of their combined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> in common equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 488 million</NUMEX> of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company .
     But some militant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> say that 's not enough .
     They contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's equity now is worthless .
     They add that it is n't costing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out , which they think contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> 's current problems .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper</ENAMEX> , the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holder</ENAMEX> of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds , has refused to join the bond-holders <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> and is said to be reviewing its legal options .
     To protect their claims , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> to invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> or more .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> who is n't involved in the deal says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> needs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 50 million</NUMEX> of new equity to survive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junk-holders</ENAMEX> say they have a stick to beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> with : `` The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool '' to extract money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR </ENAMEX>, says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">holder</ENAMEX> .
     This could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR </ENAMEX>, he adds .
     A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> 's name , and provide new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of LBOs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> and elsewhere .
     But others say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junk-holders</ENAMEX> have nothing to gain by putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy-law proceedings .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> does n't control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> which is unusual for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett </ENAMEX>.
     Bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> set a precedent for putting new money in sour LBOs recently when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> restructured foundering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seaman Furniture</ENAMEX> , doubling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> 's equity stake .
     But with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seaman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> was only trying to salvage its original investment , says bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rubin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sass Lamle Rubin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KKR</ENAMEX> probably has already made all the money it can on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV .</ENAMEX>
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who know Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> say he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SCI TV .</ENAMEX>

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid Inc.</ENAMEX> , reflecting strong earnings growth , boosted its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> dividend <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 cents</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 cents</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of household products said the new dividend is payable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 1</TIMEX> to shares of record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 10</TIMEX> .
     Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> adopted a proposal to amend its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> shareholder rights plan , further insulating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> from takeover .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> has stated repeatedly that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> should be independent , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Williams</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments , but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> or more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> 's voting securities , each right held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> would entitle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> shares with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> said the exercise price is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125</NUMEX> , meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> would have the right to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> stock for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> price , diluting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> stake .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44 cents</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.7 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 351.5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 320.4 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> shares closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33.875</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .

     The stock market went on a dizzying ride as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> comeback .
     At the end of it all , the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.69</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2659.22</NUMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> , the Dow was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80.53</NUMEX> points .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237,960,000</NUMEX> shares .
     Declining issues swamped advancers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,222</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">382</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">11 days</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> , the stock market still has a bad case of nerves .
     Takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges .
     And there is more volatility to come .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 13th</TIMEX> left us with a cut and exposed nerve , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Solomon </ENAMEX>, technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are fearful and sensitive .
     Everybody 's finger is one inch closer to the button .
     I have never had as many calls as I had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> .
     Volatility is here to stay . ''
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 80</NUMEX> points in slightly more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> after the opening bell .
     For many , it began to look like a replay of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> .
     As stocks and stock-index futures fell , a trading limit was hit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stock futures pit .
     Under a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">post-1987</TIMEX> crash reform , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> would n't permit the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures to fall further than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> points for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> .
     That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     But at a critical moment , stock-index arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> showed their power and control .
     They scooped up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures when the market needed it most .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:40 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> , several big buy orders hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks .
     `` It is very clear that those buy orders came from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who wanted their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> protected , '' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     `` These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> wanted to do something to show how powerful they are . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> were the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">force</ENAMEX> behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> were unavailable for comment .
     As in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> massacre , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> 's drop was triggered by bad news for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> statement after the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> wanted to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> independent , effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five minutes</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> opened , a preliminary price was flashed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 135 and 155</NUMEX> , a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 43</NUMEX> a share from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's close .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> finally opened for trading at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:08 a.m.</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28</NUMEX> .
     Floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said there was a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> 's post where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trades .
     `` There was a seething mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' said one floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     `` Then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added .
     Takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 700 million</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> -- started selling other stocks as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures in an attempt to hedge against a further <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> blood bath .
     Shortly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> opening , program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> index .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30 a.m.</TIMEX> the Dow was down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62.70</NUMEX> .
     All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-stocks in the MMI except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> were down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 to $ 2</NUMEX> .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:33</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> futures contract crunched to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-point loss under the force of sell programs , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures trading was halted and program trades on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances .
     Under the rules adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , the futures contract can not drop below the limit , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> can purchase futures .
     At this point , the Dow industrials were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75.41</NUMEX> points and falling .
     The trading halt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> futures exacerbated selling and confusion , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> maintain .
     But as the fright began to spread through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> pit , the big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> came in and bought futures aggressively .
     `` It was whooosh ! '' said one futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> , the Dow industrials climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 30</NUMEX> points .
     The big futures buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the Dow 's loss to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> points by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 a.m</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said the futures buying was finely calculated by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> sold stock into the big <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures hit the trading limit .
     Then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures , which abruptly halted the stock market 's decline as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> began to buy stocks .
     From then on , the Dow industrials held at a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 50</NUMEX> points .
     Then , in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-afternoon</TIMEX> trading , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred-thousand</NUMEX>-share buy orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> hit the market , including a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX>-share order through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> that seemed to spark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's late price surge .
     Almost simultaneously , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> began a very visible buy program for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of stocks .
     The combined buying rallied the Dow into a small gain , before closing at a slight loss .
     Some institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> loved the wild ride .
     `` This is fun , '' asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Del Signore</ENAMEX> , head equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Travelers Investment Management Co .</ENAMEX>
     She said she used the market 's wild swings to buy shares cheaply on the sell-off .
     On the comeback , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Del Signore</ENAMEX> unloaded shares she has been aiming to get rid of .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken .
     `` This market is eating away my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Lew</ENAMEX> , head equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson North America Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` Credibility sounds intangible .
     But I think we are losing credibility because when the market does this , it does n't present itself as a rational investment .
     But if you overlook all this , it is a beautiful market for investment still . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> buy program that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones Professional Investor Report</ENAMEX> .
     Dow Jones climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> on very heavy volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">786,100</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said a big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> buy order was behind the rise .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity .
     Other issues said to be included in the buy program were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble</ENAMEX> , which rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133 1\/2</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> , which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 3\/4</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rockwell International</ENAMEX> , which jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 1\/8</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 3\/8</NUMEX> .
     Other airline stocks fell in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's decision to remain independent for now , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group</ENAMEX> , which separately reported a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.86</NUMEX> a share compared with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> profit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68 7\/8</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3 million</NUMEX> shares ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX> slid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 1\/4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midway Airlines</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 7\/8</NUMEX> .

     Metals stocks also were especially weak , as concerns about the earnings outlook for cyclical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> weighed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aluminum Co. of America</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 1\/4</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phelps Dodge</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 7\/8</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asarco</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 3\/4</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reynolds Metals</ENAMEX> slid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 3\/8</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amax</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 5\/8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cyprus Minerals</ENAMEX> skidded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 3\/4</NUMEX> .

     After being whipsawed by a volatile stock market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds closed higher .
     But junk bonds took more hits .
     Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said trading volume was heavy as large institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> scrambled to buy long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a `` flight-to-quality '' rally .
     That happens when nervous stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> dump equities and buy Treasurys , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe .
     `` Some retail accounts , such as commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and pension funds , wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung Won Sohn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norwest Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , the Dow Jones Industrial average fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 80</NUMEX> points on news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> decided to remain independent .
     In response , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> prices soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 11.25</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     But the gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery .
     The industrial average ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2659.22</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.69</NUMEX> points .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing .
     While they do n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , for example , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported that new orders for durable goods fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> reported lackluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> sales .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1\/4</NUMEX> point higher .
     Municipal , mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point .
     But high-yield , high-risk bonds fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered .
     According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , which are the easiest to sell .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.70 %</NUMEX> bonds due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2007</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/2</NUMEX> points .
     Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> could n't find enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> to match <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> .
     `` While the stock market was falling , most -LCB- junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> -RCB- were just watching it not knowing what to do , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Suckow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of fixed-income securities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer Management Corp .</ENAMEX>
     `` It was like driving down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> watching a wreck .
     Everybody was rubber-necking . ''
     Adding to the junk market 's jitters were reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> is having trouble structuring a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> offering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW Food Services Inc.</ENAMEX> and will postpone or even cancel the issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hardee 's</ENAMEX> , a fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> , and operates several other food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> would n't comment .
     Credit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are nervous about the issue because they say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt .
     Also , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TW</ENAMEX> offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> turned a cold shoulder to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's sale of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> of new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy , given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert T. McGee </ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokai Bank Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but they 're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market . ''
     The new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes were priced with an average yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.74 %</NUMEX> .
     That was higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.71 % to 7.73 %</NUMEX> average yield that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> had expected .
     In when-issued trading , the notes were quoted at a price to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.78 %</NUMEX> .
     Sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.41-to-1</NUMEX> bid-to-cover ratio , which was lower than the average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.79-to-1 </NUMEX>ratio at the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> similar auctions .
     The ratio , which reflects the number of bids the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> receives for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen .
     Individual and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> participation in the auction was disappointing , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Interest by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> was limited , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moran </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa Securities America Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` They are typically not active in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> note auctions , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal . ''
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> generally have a positive view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline .
     He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> -RRB- refunding '' of government debt to be held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> estimated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> purchased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 10 %</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes .

     Today <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will focus on the long-awaited auction of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Funding Corp .</ENAMEX>
     The initial bond offering by the new government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , which was created to help rescue the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> , is n't expected to see robust demand .
     A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds .
     In when-issued trading , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX> bonds were quoted at a price to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.17 %</NUMEX> .

     Genetic Defect Spotted In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">3-Day-Old</TIMEX> Embryo
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">RESEARCHERS</ENAMEX> diagnosed a genetic defect in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">three-day-old</ENAMEX> mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> .
     Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as the sixth week</TIMEX> of pregnancy is increasingly common <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     But the mouse experiment at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Medical Research Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> shows genetic defects can be detected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> after conception using a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-developed gene-copying technique .
     The experiment , applicable to many genetic disorders , involved <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">beta-thalassemia</ENAMEX> , a severe blood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene .
     It 's an inherited human disorder that 's been duplicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> .
     In the experiment , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the defective gene were mated .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three days later</TIMEX> , before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus , it was washed out of the mother <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> .
     The embryo had progressed only to a clump of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> identical cells .
     One cell was teased out , and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> extracted .
     Using the new technique developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cetus Corp.</ENAMEX> , called the polymerase chain reaction , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> rapidly made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of copies of the section of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">DNA</ENAMEX> that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene , providing enough copies to test .
     A genetic probe showed the hemoglobin gene was missing , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> report in the medical journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lancet</ENAMEX> .
     In the report , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> .
     For example , infertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">eggs</ENAMEX> fertilized in the test tube usually have several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">eggs</ENAMEX> fertilized at a time .
     When the fertilized cells divide to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cells , a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects .
     A healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ones</NUMEX> discarded .
     Or in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> , the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> after conception and returned if healthy , or discarded if not .
     Yeast Adapted to Make Gene-Spliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">Drugs</ENAMEX>
     AN OIL <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">COMPANY</ENAMEX> finds a sideline in the microscopic world of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">yeast</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> , when the `` world food crisis '' was a major worry , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> , like several other big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , began developing `` single-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> , '' edible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> made by microbes feeding on non-edible materials .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> found and improved a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">yeast</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Pichia pastoris</ENAMEX> , '' which made <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> from natural gas-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">alcohol</ENAMEX> .
     It also could convert <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glucose</ENAMEX> from farm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">wastes</ENAMEX> into edible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> .
     Single-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">protein</ENAMEX> never panned out , and most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> abandoned such research .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> persisted , calling in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Salk Institute</ENAMEX> .
     They 've now adapted the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">yeast</ENAMEX> to making genetically engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> used by genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">yeast</ENAMEX> can take in human genes and churn out human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> for medical use .
     But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> than the bacterial genetic apparatus .
     Thus , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">yeast</ENAMEX> are molecularly more like human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> than those from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> .
     The oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> claims its yeast system also is better than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> at high-volume production of genetically engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chiron Corp.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Emeryville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , is seeing if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">yeast</ENAMEX> can be used to make its genetically engineered human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">proteins</ENAMEX> .
     Peeking Inside Arteries From Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body</ENAMEX>
     VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without poking catheters into the body may come out of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Strokes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX> , leg pains -LRB- intermittent claudication -RRB- and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">deposits</ENAMEX> .
     At present , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> can see how badly an artery is clogged only by inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid that makes the arteries visible on X-rays .
     A non-invasive method is being researched by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biophysicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Jelinski</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&amp;T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when subjected to an intense magnetic field .
     It 's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI -LRB- magnetic resonance imaging -RRB- scanners being used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> in place of X-ray scans .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell Labs</ENAMEX> experiments , an MRI-type of machine , synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram , rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">blood</ENAMEX> passes a certain point in a vessel .
     The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">blood</ENAMEX> give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , -LRB- like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> when a strobe light is flashing -RRB- .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> .
     They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">blood</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> for such tiny blood vessels , they report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nature</ENAMEX> , a scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">journal</ENAMEX> .
     They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow .
     The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Wang </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , attributed the drop to the disruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> .
     The acquisition was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> that the acquisition was being delayed , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed .
     The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products , a core area for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> , as well as sales of other products as part of package sales .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Residents</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> 's outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> '' -- <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View Cemetery</ENAMEX> .
     Despite such famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> as oil magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Rockefeller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View Cemetery</ENAMEX> has fallen on hard times .
     So the inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">burial ground</ENAMEX> is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign .
     The ads celebrate the achievements of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     A spot honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill White</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of chewing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gum</ENAMEX> , shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> trying to extricate her high-heeled shoe from a wad of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gum</ENAMEX> .
     Another focuses on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Brush</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to light a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> electrically .
     It shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> hurling rocks at a street lamp .
     Street lights , the ad points out , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> . ''
     Cemetery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> hope the ads , which will begin airing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , will not only draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View</ENAMEX> had an operating deficit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cemetery</ENAMEX> .
     The private , non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cemetery</ENAMEX> has had trouble competing against its for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">counterparts</ENAMEX> , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots .
     `` We do n't want to be known as ambulance chasers , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Garrison</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     `` We want <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View</ENAMEX> as an historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">park</ENAMEX> and educational experience ... .
     A pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">place</ENAMEX> to come and spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> . ''
     Not all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cemetery</ENAMEX> 's better-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> lend themselves to the promotional job at hand , however .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Garfield</ENAMEX> is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1881</TIMEX> .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrison</ENAMEX> notes , however , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield</ENAMEX> tomb is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's premier examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> architecture . -RRB-
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> , buried beneath a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">180-foot</NUMEX>-tall granite obelisk , did n't seem right for an ad either .
     The oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate</ENAMEX> , who spent his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later years</TIMEX> passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image , `` is n't terribly amusing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Olson</ENAMEX> , creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Innis-Maggiore-Olson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Canton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , which is producing the ads .
     But there are plenty of other promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Lake View</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> believe : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Ball</ENAMEX> , for instance , who wrote `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">When Irish Eyes are Smiling</ENAMEX> , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrett Morgan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Euro Disneyland</ENAMEX> shares made a debut like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow White</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> while most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> stock market looked like it had eaten the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil Queen </ENAMEX>'s poisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apple</ENAMEX> .
     In its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first day</TIMEX> of when-issued trading here , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Euro Disney</ENAMEX> soared like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dumbo</ENAMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">814 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.05</NUMEX> -RRB- , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> from its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">707-pence</NUMEX> offering price .
     The overall <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market , following Wall Street 's early nosedive , took a late beating .
     The Financial Times-Stock Exchange <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-Share Index plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40.4</NUMEX> points to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2149.3</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> credited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Euro Disney</ENAMEX> 's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the shares are destined to help finance : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">4,800-acre</NUMEX> theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">park</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> miles east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">park</ENAMEX> is slated to open in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     `` The issue was very well-received -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney</ENAMEX> is such a well-known , you can say world-wide , name , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Dempsey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> trader of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> equities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which is making a market in the issue .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dempsey</ENAMEX> estimated that the issue 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between five million and six million</NUMEX> shares . ''
     Most of the buying was institutional , he added .
     Official trading in the shares will start in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 6</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 billion</NUMEX> , comes to market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will be permitted to buy the shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">investors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">90 days later</TIMEX> .
     Because of the interest connected with the issue , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> took the unusual step of letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market .
     A volatile , unofficial `` gray '' market in the shares has been operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about two weeks</TIMEX> .
     In contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> performance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Euro Disney</ENAMEX> there closed down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three francs</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 1\/2 francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.66</NUMEX> -RRB- bid , but still <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> over the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72-franc</NUMEX> offering price .
     `` A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing , '' cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alistair Cuddeford</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers International Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> who makes a market in franc-denominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Euro Disney</ENAMEX> shares .
     `` There should be no great rush for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to buy this .
     A lot of big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> arb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">accounts</ENAMEX> have been buying the stock just to flip it '' for a quick profit , he said .
