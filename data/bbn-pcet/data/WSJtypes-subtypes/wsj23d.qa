     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> said it reduced its rating on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade .

     The rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">L.F.

     Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves .
     Does this signal another <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> is coming ?
     Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , eventually turned out to be ?
     Here 's what several leading market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's action , what happens next and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should do .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Granville</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'm the only one who said there would be an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> massacre , all through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville </ENAMEX>, once a widely followed market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> and still a well-known newsletter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> .
     `` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     `` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .
     If you 're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> , you obey the signals .
     Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out .
     I see no major support until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2200</TIMEX> .
     I see a possibility of going to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2200</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granville</ENAMEX> says he would n't even think of buying until at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> stocks have hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> lows ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> stocks hit new lows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' he says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Garzarelli</ENAMEX> .
     A quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garzarelli</ENAMEX> had warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> to take their money out of the market before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash .
     This was an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> massacre '' like those that occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> .
     Now , as in those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> , her stock market indicators are positive .
     So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained .
     `` Those corrections lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one to four weeks</TIMEX> and took the market <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%-12 %</NUMEX> down , '' she says .
     `` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned . ''
     Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2450</NUMEX> , `` It would just be a fluke .
     My advice is to buy . ''
     As she calculates it , the average stock now sells for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12.5</NUMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' earnings .
     She says that ratio could climb to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.5</NUMEX> , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Davis</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ned Davis Research Inc .</ENAMEX>
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis </ENAMEX>, whose views are widely respected by money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , says he expects no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX>-style crash .
     `` There was a unique combination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     `` Margin debt was at a record high .
     There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds .
     The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> against losses . ``
     A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred billion dollars</NUMEX> in stock was subject '' to it .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , such selling contributed to a snowball effect .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> could even be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an up day</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> says , if major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> agree to refrain from program trading .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next several months</TIMEX> , though , he says things look bad .
     `` I think the market will be heading down into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     `` We will probably have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> rally , and then go down again .
     Sort of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-step bear market . ''
     He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</NUMEX> sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     `` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says .
     `` I guess that 's my forecast . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon G. Cooperman</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't think the market is going through another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October '87</TIMEX> .
     I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooperman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs Asset Management</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooperman</ENAMEX> sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush .
     `` I expect the market to open weaker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , but then it should find some stability . ''
     He ticks off several major differences between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , interest rates have been falling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the dollar has been strong .
     And unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating .
     But the economy 's slower growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> also means the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says .
     `` So it 's a very mixed bag . ''
     Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks .
     `` If I had come into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying .
     But we came into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> . ``
     We 're going to look for some of the better-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that got clocked '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kenneth Galbraith</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galbraith</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> .
     `` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says .
     `` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and loaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .
     This has both made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> uneasy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> more vulnerable . ''
     Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely .
     `` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says .
     `` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thirties</TIMEX> -- much as the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> may try . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Gabelli</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at spotting takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidates</ENAMEX> , says that takeovers are n't totally gone .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> are still going to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> around the world , '' he says .
     Examples are `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> . ''
     These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli</ENAMEX> figures they will continue .
     `` The market was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> since -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> took office , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelli</ENAMEX> says , so a correction was to be expected .
     He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge .
     `` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -LCB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this -RCB- week</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> like me , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Rogers </ENAMEX>.
     `` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Columbia University</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-manager</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most successful hedge funds in history , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Quantum Fund</ENAMEX> .
     He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> you could n't sell dollars , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ''
     If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and make it hard for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> to ease interest rates very much .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> wo n't decide what to do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> until he sees how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> markets go .
     He recommends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Curzio </ENAMEX>.
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now claim to have predicted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Queens</ENAMEX> newsletter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis X. Curzio</ENAMEX> actually did it : He stated in writing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1987</TIMEX> that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the following month</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curzio</ENAMEX> says what happens now will depend a good deal on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> .
     If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , he says , `` That could quiet things down . ''
     If not , `` We could go to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2200</NUMEX> very soon . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W. Terrizzi</ENAMEX> .
     Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrizzi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance Investment Management Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> , which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> , drew stiff criticism from many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> because it pulled entirely out of stocks at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> and thus missed a strong rally .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     `` T-bills probably are the right place to be , '' he says .

     Regarding the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 3</TIMEX> letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing</ENAMEX> , alleging :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . That your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 28</TIMEX> editorial `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Kangaroo Committees</ENAMEX> '' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading .
     I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . That Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> supported the rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> .
     Yes , he did .
     As I watched him on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">C-Span</ENAMEX> , I heard him speak those lovely words about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> , which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings .
     He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     He used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 56</NUMEX> words defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> ' constitutional rights .
     Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> words heaping scorn on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> for exercising the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> .
     He sandwiched his praise of constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">meat</ENAMEX> between large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">loaves</ENAMEX> of bilious commentary .
     As your editorial rightly pointed out , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Wilson</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> 's former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> .
     '' That certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading '' indicated by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . That his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> does not deal with any possible criminal activity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> .
     My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and I fully realize we are not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> ... etc . ''
     Absolute rubbish .
     By any `` reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> '' criterion , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have a whole bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tried and convicted .
     Apparently , their verdict is in .
     Right now they 're pursuing evidence .
     That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> practice .
     How was that practice referred to when I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> ?
     Ah , yes , something called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Star Chamber</ENAMEX> .
     Of course , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> doth protest that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> simply seeks information for legislative change .
     No doubt that 's partially true .
     Everything that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> says in his letter is partially true .
     He 's right about his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ?
     Why not simply questions designed to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and causes of waste and inefficiency ?
     Such as , what happened when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> wanted to know about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400</NUMEX> toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ?
     No , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> 's complaints simply wo n't wash .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . That the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that took place while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> , '' etc. and so forth .
     No , to my mind , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ... ''
     it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .
     The problem , which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> , who after all is really a bit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> on the stage , but the attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">body</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -RRB-
     The system is the problem , not an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> can always have their hands slapped .
     It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble .
     I do not by any means defend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> could possibly generate .
     The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy</ENAMEX> did his work .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Weber</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Parsippany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J .</ENAMEX>
     I disagree with the statement by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> that one should not draw an adverse inference against former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who assert their <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> states in relevant part that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> against himself . ''
     This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> who chooses not to testify .
     Thus , in a criminal case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> can not comment on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's failure to testify nor can the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> be compelled to take the stand as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> , thus forcing him to `` take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> . ''
     The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> in criminal matters only .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have specifically recognized that `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to a civil cause .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baxter</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmingiano</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">425 U.S. 308</ENAMEX> -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Thus , in a civil case , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> may be called as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> , he may be forced to testify or take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> , and his taking of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
     He may take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
     Allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
     Absent the risk of such prosecution , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> may order the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> to testify .
     Thus , when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> asserted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .
     Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX> shield against self-incrimination .

     It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> , and the stock market plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</NUMEX> points .
     Just a coincidence ?
     Or is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">triskaidekaphobia</ENAMEX> -- fear of the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> -- justified ?
     In academia , a so-called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> effect has been set up and shot down by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kolb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricardo Rodriguez</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> of finance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Miami</ENAMEX> , found evidence that the market is spooked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> .
     But their study , which spanned the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1962-85</TIMEX> period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> , the market took falls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> times in a row on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the you-know-what</TIMEX> .
     But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yale Hirsch</ENAMEX> , a collector of stock market lore .
     Another study found that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Fridays the 13th</TIMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1940-1987</TIMEX> period had higher than average returns -- higher even than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> in general , which tend to be strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> for stock prices .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the only other Friday the 13th this year</TIMEX> , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> points .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolb</ENAMEX> says the original study , titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Friday the 13th , Part VII</ENAMEX> , was published tongue-in-cheek .
     In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> 's full moon could have played a part , too , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market activity .

     reminiscent of those during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered .
     `` We could n't get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> to answer their phones , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert King</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robinson-Humphrey Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> .
     `` It was -LCB- like -RCB- the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> stocks sank far less than those on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> and its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> worst ever , diving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.90</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">467.29</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> points of the drop occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 45 minutes</TIMEX> of trading .
     By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 16 , 1987</TIMEX> , the Nasdaq Composite fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.18</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</NUMEX> , followed by its devastating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46.12</NUMEX>-point , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> slide , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three days later</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167.7 million</NUMEX> shares , which was only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fifth busiest day</TIMEX> so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">single-day</TIMEX> record of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288 million</NUMEX> shares was set on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 21</TIMEX> ,
     `` There was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.E. `` Buzzy '' Geduld</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Herzog , Heine , Geduld</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that makes markets in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of OTC issues .
     Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> rather than individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robinson-Humphrey</ENAMEX> and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .
     The subject is a sore one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> and its market-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which were widely criticized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> following complaints from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who could n't reach their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> or trade in the chaos of the crash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of retail equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , declared : `` It was the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last hour</TIMEX> of trading on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> to be as efficient as robots .
     It was n't intentional , we were all busy . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Tarantino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht &amp; Quist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , said , `` It was just like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremiah Mullins</ENAMEX> , the OTC trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , said proudly that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> executed every order it received by the close of trading .
     But , he added , `` you can only take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> call at a time . ''
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , that means they must buy shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> when no one else is willing to .
     When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , some market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> were selling again , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarantino</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hambrecht &amp; Quist</ENAMEX> said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares .
     `` Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , '' he said .
     So , while OTC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> incurred losses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the damage was n't as bad as it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit .
     I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robinson-Humphrey</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Cecin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper , Jaffray &amp; Hopwood</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> , said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper Jaffray</ENAMEX> actually made money on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     It helped that his inventory is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> smaller now than it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hardiman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX> , which oversees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . ''
     `` The pace of trading was orderly , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardiman</ENAMEX> .
     Nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' confidence .
     In the past , the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation .
     Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and OTC market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> hope the damage wo n't be permanent .
     But they are worried .
     `` We were just starting to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter </ENAMEX>.
     More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cecin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Piper Jaffray</ENAMEX> says some action from government policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> would allay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> fears .
     It wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sellers</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , as well as individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     But grateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the sell orders generally ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> shares to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> shares , compared with blocks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> shares or more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> said retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> nervously sold stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and never returned to bargain-hunt .
     Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , which had been selling stock throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> to lock in handsome gains made through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , were calmer .
     `` We had a good amount of selling from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> , but not as much panic , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> said .
     `` If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . ''
     In addition , he said , some bigger institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down .
     In addition , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</NUMEX> small stocks and the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's biggest stocks were hammered .
     The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.76</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">449.33</NUMEX> .
     The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.31</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">462.98</NUMEX> .
     The OTC market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks .
     But they fell sharply .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications</ENAMEX> , for instance , has offered to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metromedia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> properties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contel Cellular</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1\/2</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> , dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 1\/2</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     The turnover in both issues was roughly normal .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day</TIMEX> when negative takeover-related news did n't sit well with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of engineered metal parts , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haas &amp; Partners</ENAMEX> advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.50</NUMEX>-a-share bid to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX> plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> .
     The issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     On the OTC market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> , a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 1\/4</NUMEX> .
     Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">OTC</ENAMEX> issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> , dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 7\/8</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Laidlaw Transportation</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 1\/2</NUMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> depositary receipts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> were off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 1\/4</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX> slipped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1\/2</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 3\/4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nike</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 3\/4</NUMEX> .

     Pension funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">behemoths</ENAMEX> of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market rout .
     And they plan to buy more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .
     To be sure , big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     They could still panic and bail out of the market .
     But their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .
     `` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Rogers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ariel Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> of stocks .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> spent half his cash on hand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ''
     He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX>-based portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Craig</ENAMEX> was n't daunted when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's rout shaved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> from the value of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 752 million</NUMEX> Janus Fund he oversees .
     `` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said .
     Then he jumped into the market :
     `` I spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half-hour</TIMEX> . ''
     Other money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> also opened their wallets .
     `` I was buying at the close -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick A.

     `` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . ''
     Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> rush to withdraw money , big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> such as pension funds and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .
     Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 trillion</NUMEX> from pension funds alone .
     `` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B. Timbers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services Inc .</ENAMEX>

     `` The last crash taught institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> that they have to be long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holders</ENAMEX> , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen L. Nesbitt</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for the pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consultants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wilshire Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX>
     `` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's decline .
     Stocks , as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index , have been stellar performers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.97 %</NUMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge , excluding dividends .
     Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's slump leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ahead <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> , well above the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> average for stocks over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several decades</TIMEX> .
     `` You could go down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> points and still have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good year</TIMEX> in the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D.

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awad</ENAMEX> , however , worries that the market `` could go down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days</TIMEX> .
     It can happen before you can turn around . ''
     He said he discerns many parallels with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading .
     `` The only thing you do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . ''
     Most institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> futures contracts .
     In its severest test , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion</NUMEX> of portfolio insurance in effect in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash did n't work , as stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .
     Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Weisman</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chilmark Capital Partners</ENAMEX> had converted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220 million</NUMEX> investment pool to cash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , said he was besieged by Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> asking him to take stock off their hands .
     `` We got calls from big block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisman</ENAMEX> , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisman</ENAMEX> predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few days</TIMEX> before declining again , trapping more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said .
     Meanwhile , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> brought a reprieve for money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally .
     Especially gleeful were the short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> , who have been pounded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's market climb .
     The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest short-selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Feshbach Brothers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , which said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May</TIMEX> that its short positions had shown losses of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> up to that point .
     All that now has changed .
     `` We 're ahead for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> because of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Feshbach</ENAMEX> .

     The eventual court decision could become a landmark in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> corporate law because the lawsuit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO</ENAMEX> plans to file would be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to challenge the entire principle and practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX> .
     Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> noted .
     Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> uphold the validity of this type of defense , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ASKO</ENAMEX> will then ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Koninklijke Ahold NV</ENAMEX> .

     `` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kudlow</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> , on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">This Week</ENAMEX> . ''
     -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Skinner</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> to reduce a stake held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     But he has since run into opposition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> over that decision .
     And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , which includes a big stake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's anti-takeover policy was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason that financing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop .
     In many ways , the backdrop to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX>-point crash .
     Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> of taking hold .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> .
     And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> -- were making markets nervous .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> to the table for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> budget summit , resulting in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> plan to reduce the deficit by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 76 billion</NUMEX> -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion</NUMEX> during that period .
     But , barring further drops in the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , a similar outcome does n't seem likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> and administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> agree that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">sides</ENAMEX> back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the economy and the market can survive a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX>-point tumble .
     `` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> , that we were looking at a recession , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in an interview .
     `` That did not happen .
     They learned they could survive it without much problem . ''
     But administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> privately agree with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> , who said a precipitous drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> `` is going to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ''
     In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around .
     `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> -- and there should be - that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has been unwilling to cut what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> asked us to cut , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> over the capital-gains fight .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are particularly angry over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .
     `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> because the administration simply did n't live up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's deal , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Face the Nation</ENAMEX> . ''
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> were at odds .
     At the very moment that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> that it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's policy to include it .
     When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> , the ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the tax-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> , hailed it .
     Asked if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> agreed , he curtly replied : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">adminstration</ENAMEX> will have to speak for itself . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> at the soonest .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> expressed the hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> would follow the lead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , which on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> deficit .
     `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.H .</ENAMEX> -RRB- . said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> , whose calculations determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman</ENAMEX> targets are met , estimated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> shortfall by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.2 billion</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> 's estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.0 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">OMB</ENAMEX> 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''
     No one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> was willing to take the blame for provoking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's drop in the stock market .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> were quick to seize the moment .
     Before the sun had set on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rahn</ENAMEX> , the supply-side chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> decision to postpone action on capital gains .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said .
     `` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .

     '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX> believes , however , that the market could be stabilized if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> steps back in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> bidding with an offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sara Albert</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">34-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it .
     `` I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . ''
     She and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> pulled most of their investments out of the market after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , although she still owns some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> stock .
     Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> to go to school , `` I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid . ''
     Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> can stand .
     `` We all assumed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October '87</TIMEX> was a one-time shot , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Greenberg</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> got out just before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared .
     This time he 's ready to buy in `` when the panic wears off . ''
     Still , he adds : `` We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> ca n't survive without the little guy . ''
     Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have tiptoed back into the market following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , but mostly through mutual funds .
     Discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Quick Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quick &amp; Reilly</ENAMEX> discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Quackenbush</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Scwhab Corp.</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schwab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> `` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks .

''
     But it 's not only the stock market that has some small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> worried .

     The crowded field for notebook-sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> 's long-awaited entry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> , the current market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader</ENAMEX> , and on a swarm of promising start-ups .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . ''
     But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,400 to $ 5,000</NUMEX> .
     All of this comes in a machine that weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only six pounds</NUMEX> and fits comfortably into most briefcases .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's competition , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX> all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , noting that most such machines are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about two inches</NUMEX> thick , takes exception to the name .
     `` This is n't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook , '' he says .
     That ca n't be said of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,400</NUMEX> notepad computer introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GRiD Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> .
     Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">4 1\/2 pounds</NUMEX> , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> froth .
     Palmtops are n't far behind .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atari Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Portfolio</ENAMEX> , introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">less than a pound</NUMEX> , costs a mere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400</NUMEX> and runs on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> , however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Lotus 1-2-3</ENAMEX> and other sophisticated software programs , but costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times as much .
     At stake is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Swavely</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> operations , calls `` the Holy Grail of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . ''
     The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be .
     `` I 've had a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Humphries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GRiD</ENAMEX> .
     `` Whether it 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.5 billion</NUMEX> , it does n't matter .
     It 's huge . ''
     Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> of all personal computer sales .
     Laptops -- generally anything under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises .
     Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory .
     It also has precluded use of the faster , more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines .
     Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .
     The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , for example , criticizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atari</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Portfolio</ENAMEX> because it requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> batteries while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet</ENAMEX> needs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> .
     Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet</ENAMEX> also encountered in focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> , admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Purdy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of marketing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet</ENAMEX> , trying to avoid the `` gadget '' label , responded with the tag line , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Poquet</ENAMEX> PC -- a Very Big Computer . ''
     Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises .
     Toward that end , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say the real battle will take place between center-stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dynabook Inc.</ENAMEX> , which introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> a computer that , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's , uses an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">286</ENAMEX> microprocessor and has a hard disk drive .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dynabook</ENAMEX> product is twice as heavy and costs more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's announcement also spells trouble for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie. des Machines Bull</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX>-owned computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> will vote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> on the proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 635 million</NUMEX> sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> 's share and sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> is already taking aim at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> 's market share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Canion</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , notes pointedly that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">MinisPort</ENAMEX> uses an `` unconventional '' <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two-inch</NUMEX> floppy disk , whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's new machines use the more common <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3 1\/2-inch</NUMEX> disk .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P. Frank </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Zenith Data Systems</ENAMEX> , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3 1\/2-inch</NUMEX> floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">five-inch</NUMEX> disks .
     `` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> do n't see it that way .
     `` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> and a stopper for everyone else , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Talsky</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Professional Marketing Management Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lempesis</ENAMEX> , senior industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DataQuest </ENAMEX>, a high-technology market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> : `` We basically think that these are very hot products .
     The problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's machines include the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3 1\/2-inch</NUMEX> floppy disk drive , a backlit screen that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">only 1\/4-inch</NUMEX> thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine .
     Others undoubtedly will follow , but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> has at least a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> lead on the competition .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> 's line of portables , for example , features the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">T-1000</ENAMEX> , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">T-1600</ENAMEX> , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the size .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> model , marketed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , may hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the first quarter of 1990</TIMEX> , but by then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> will have established itself as one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> .
     What about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Blue</ENAMEX> ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market drop .
     That 's because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market .
     Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> of its original value .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> may begin liquidating the securities .
     But some big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls .
     Margin calls since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> said .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avis</ENAMEX> would n't specify the costs but said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> being dropped account for `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">far less than half</NUMEX> '' of the total .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is expected to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cyclone</ENAMEX> by discounting its own mainframes , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly three</NUMEX> times the price of a comparable system from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> .

     Do n't jump yet .
     The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one wild hour</TIMEX> of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> .
     It is forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .
     The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business -- indeed , the entire economy .
     This may sound strangely optimistic .
     After all , until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy .
     When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .
     That has changed , partly because the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Zarnowitz</ENAMEX> .
     The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy .
     `` The market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> has a life of its own , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Akers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> .
     `` There 's nothing rational about this kind of action . ''
     Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> upon whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> now relies for financial sustenance .
     The financial-services industry was battered by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy is weaker .
     Growth is slower .
     Profits are softer .
     Debt burdens are heavier .
     But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> , which until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies .
     But the experience of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash suggests the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
     Anticipating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's move , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.625 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.820 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> before .
     Tiny movements in the rate , which is what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> leaves on the monetary markets .
     The dollar also began to decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> as the stock market 's plunge caused some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to reassess their desire to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have been arguing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> .
     The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> was right about the overpriced dollar .
     A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     That was n't the case in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , when the dollar was so weak that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     Another big difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> is n't so comforting .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1987</TIMEX> , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</NUMEX> .
     The consensus among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> is that it grew a much more sluggish <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1989</TIMEX> , which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Chimerine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">WEFA Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bala Cynwyd</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     `` A lot of pent-up demand is gone . ''
     Consumer spending did drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months</TIMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zarnowitz</ENAMEX> , a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of business cycles .
     `` That was offset by strength elsewhere .
     -LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .
     '' Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> and if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> retrench in reaction .
     What 's more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> .
     `` We 've had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two more years</TIMEX> of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chimerine</ENAMEX> notes .
     The more a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> may end up in bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> , of course , knows that very well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> .
     But , in the process , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> risks reigniting inflation .
     Even before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's events , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Friedman</ENAMEX> was arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .
     The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation .
     In the end , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices .
     The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly inspire confidence .
     Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will .
     If the reactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> gathered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hot Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va.</ENAMEX> , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Business Council</ENAMEX> meetings are typical , business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were n't overly rattled by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's decline .
     And if foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can stand it .
     On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , about the only point of comparison was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> crash and the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Depression</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doomsayers</ENAMEX> had a receptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     The prosperity that followed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> permits a more optimistic view <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     At the very least , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">establishment</ENAMEX> here is taking comfort from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's success in handling the last go-around .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> avoided a meltdown last time .
     They are more sophisticated this time .

     The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Producers</ENAMEX> of commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> , the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> produced in huge volumes for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> , have seen sharp inventory cutting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     Once the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of the industry 's now fading boom , these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` For some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , this will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> with year-to-year negative comparisons , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bogner</ENAMEX> , a chemical industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Bache Research</ENAMEX> .
     `` This could be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> down quarters . ''
     Perhaps most prominent , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> , which as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear</TIMEX> had racked up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight consecutive record quarters</TIMEX> , is expected to report that profit decreased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , if only by a shade .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> has aggressively diversified into specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> still has a big stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , which is used in packaging and housewares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> ' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> estimates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Midland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> are between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.20</NUMEX> a share and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.30</NUMEX> a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.36</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , when profit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 632 million</NUMEX> on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.15 billion</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the estimates .
     At the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> representative of the whole industry by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 % to 10 %</NUMEX> .
     `` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> about even or slightly better , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wilbur</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> projects that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> it follows will report lower profit .
     Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> have big commodity-chemical operations .
     Still , some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont Co.</ENAMEX> is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pigments</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fibers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polymers</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wilmington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is helped when prices weaken on the commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> it buys for its own production needs , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> are divided over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> will report much of a gain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conoco Inc.</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.25 to $ 2.45</NUMEX> a share .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 461 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.91</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.99 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX> , too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> were hurt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> by drought in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is expected to report again that losses in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">G.D. Searle &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> are narrowing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Searle</ENAMEX> continued to operate in the red through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the year</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> has said it expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Searle</ENAMEX> to post a profit for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     Most estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 1.70 and $ 2</NUMEX> a share .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.67</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.02 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">commodity-chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle .
     By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may presage firmer demand .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX> say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990s</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> , at least , profit is expected to fall sharply .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont Inc.</ENAMEX> , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Ravitz</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> .
     The projections are in the neighborhood of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> , compared with a restated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.65</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , when profit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 107.8 million</NUMEX> on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 435.5 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont</ENAMEX> faces lower prices for its mainstay product , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polypropylene</ENAMEX> , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polypropylene</ENAMEX> , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wilmington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del.</ENAMEX> , is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Montedison S.p . A.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milan</ENAMEX> , which has an offer outstanding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont</ENAMEX> shares it does n't already own .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum Chemical Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , the trouble is lower prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> hedge their estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum </ENAMEX>, because it is n't known when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will book certain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time charges .
     But the estimates range from break-even to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 third quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 99.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.92</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 724.4 million</NUMEX> .
     Another big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> , is expected to post profit of between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> a share and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.56</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 213 million</NUMEX> on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.11 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Himont</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Carbide</ENAMEX> all declined to comment .
