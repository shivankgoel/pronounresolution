     His projection indicates profit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 17.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55 cents</NUMEX> a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> said in an interview that sales will show an increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> of `` somewhat <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 %</NUMEX> . ''
     Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first six months of 1989</TIMEX> , sales had grown about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period .
     Growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> would make sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 269 million</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 244.6 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> said the profit growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> was due to the sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Asilone</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">antacid</ENAMEX> , was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boots PLC</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Thrombinar</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> used to stanch bleeding , was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jones Medical Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> .
     As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> level , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> had projected lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> operating profit but higher profit for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is still looking for `` a strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth quarter</TIMEX> in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> attributed the decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> products in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> because of a then-pending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1</TIMEX> price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Maalox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">antacid</ENAMEX> , whose sales and market share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> had slipped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of 1989</TIMEX> .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> opted to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Asilone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Thrombinar</ENAMEX> to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Maalox</ENAMEX> , still its top-selling product with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 215 million</NUMEX> in world-wide sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     `` We had underfunded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Maalox</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> , '' he said , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was concentrating on research and development and promoting other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> will spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million to $ 20 million</NUMEX> more on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Maalox</ENAMEX> advertising and promotion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of 1989</TIMEX> than in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period .
     A `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , he said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> , rising imports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> and overseas , and declining demand .

     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> anniversary of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , but this time it was different .
     Stocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data that showed less inflation than expected .
     Blue chips led the march up in heavy trading .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39.55</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2683.20</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> industrials led the market higher from the opening bell as foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> stepped in .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , the broader market joined the advance in full strength .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock Index rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.37</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347.13</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite index jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.52</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">470.80</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume swelled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">198,120,000</NUMEX> shares .
     The industrials were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX> points in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , but cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> took profits before the close .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said a variety of factors triggered the rally .
     The consumer price index rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , while many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> were looking for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> increase .
     Stock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally 's momentum .
     The euphoria was such that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> responded to good earnings reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> , while ignoring the disappointing profits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's rally , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">buyers</ENAMEX> were the main force pushing blue chips higher .
     To the amazement of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , takeover stocks were climbing again .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> , for example .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX> , takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> spilled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> , knocking the stock down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> .
     Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Holiday Corp.</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honeywell</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> is n't making a special effort to revive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out .
     The announcement of the buy-out 's troubles triggered the market 's nose dive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week ago</TIMEX> .
     Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> disclosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International </ENAMEX>.
     `` That 's put some oomph back into this market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter VandenBerg</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> thought there was less to the rally than met the eye .
     `` There is no strength behind this rally , '' asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Lew</ENAMEX> , head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson North America</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> squaring positions .
     It 's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall . ''
     Indeed , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said that uncertainty about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> expiration of stocks-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices .
     The number of outstanding contracts in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> Major Market Index jumped from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,273</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,023</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     The MMI is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
     Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , the outstanding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> contracts amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,524</NUMEX> , representing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.13 billion</NUMEX> in stock , noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Selkin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of stock-index futures research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX> , who expects a volatile expiration <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     `` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI positions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selkin</ENAMEX> said .
     Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 1\/2</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7 million</NUMEX> shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 3\/8</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 3\/8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 3\/8</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 5\/8</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IMA Acquisition</ENAMEX> , an investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> had made arrangements for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 509 million</NUMEX> in bank financing for the buy-out offer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , are providing the rest of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> .
     Elsewhere on the takeover front , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136 5\/8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications</ENAMEX> tacked on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 7\/8</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Delaware Supreme Court</ENAMEX> affirmed a ruling that barred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chris-Craft Industries</ENAMEX> from voting its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> preferred stock as a separate class in deciding on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' proposed merger .

     Among other actual and rumored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">targets</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 1\/2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> went up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 3\/4</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armstrong World Industries</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 1\/8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 7\/8</NUMEX> .

     If you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news .
     You 're probably right , and you are n't alone .
     A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> Poll study commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York Business Group on Health</ENAMEX> , found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a full 25 %</NUMEX> of the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> may suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety disorders</ENAMEX> or a stress-related illness , with about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> .
     The study surveyed a national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and employee assistance program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> about their perceptions of these problems in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     It is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a series of studies on health commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New York Business Group</ENAMEX> , a non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     The stress study was undertaken because problems related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon J. Warshaw</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     In presenting the study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warshaw</ENAMEX> estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial .
     Occupational disability related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> costs about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8,000</NUMEX> a case in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> 's compensation .
     In terms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days</TIMEX> lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> loses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about 16 work days</TIMEX> a year because of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> .
     He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims .
     `` We hope to sensitize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">employers</ENAMEX> '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warshaw</ENAMEX> said .
     Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Council on Compensation Insurance</ENAMEX> .
     But although <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seeking help .
     The disorders , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX> struck middle-age and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , `` now strike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at the height of productivity , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M.A. Hirschfeld</ENAMEX> , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Institute of Mental Health</ENAMEX> , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .
     The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> 's view of the problem , with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> of those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> agreeing .
     The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than eight</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reported such a stress-provoking situation in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Mid-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings .
     The study , which received funding from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn Co.</ENAMEX> , which makes several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> to treat stress-related illnesses , also found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> contribute to decreased production .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Alcohol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">substance</ENAMEX> abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of those polled .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warshaw</ENAMEX> points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> have their positive uses , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> that may contribute to burnout . ''
     He also noted that various work environments , such as night work , have their own `` stressors . ''
     `` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul D'Arcy </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle</ENAMEX> , a corporate psychology and management consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     The problem , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Arcy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> , is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .

     For Cheap Air Fares , Spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> Aloft

     But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap .
     But there still are a few ways <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> can qualify under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's many restrictions .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best deals , though , may mean skipping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> dinner with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This week</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to fly on some of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year</TIMEX> , including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> had waited until the last moment to court <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> season <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> with bargain fares .
     That approach flopped : <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Christmas Day</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USAir Group Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">DC-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">jetliner</ENAMEX> flew about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
     So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> are getting a jump on holiday discounts .
     They are cutting ticket prices by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 70 %</NUMEX> from normal levels for travel to most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> locations on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 24</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">25</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">29</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">31</TIMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 4</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">5</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">6</TIMEX> .
     The promotions -- dubbed everything from 'T- is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Season</TIMEX> to be Jolly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kringle</ENAMEX> fares -- put round-trip fares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 98</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 148</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 198</NUMEX> .
     `` They 're trying to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> flying on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days</TIMEX> they 'd normally park them , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Bard </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mr. Mitchell Travel Service</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Burnsville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C</ENAMEX> .
     Expect , of course , sky-high prices on other dates near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> are eager to travel .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> catch : Only immediate family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are allowed , and they must have the same last name as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> of the ticket or legal proof they 're related .
     That irritates many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who have n't taken their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> ' last name .
     `` What a bunch of nonsense , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Crosby</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">chapter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Women Business Owners</ENAMEX> .

     In an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> release , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BP</ENAMEX> said initial production from the field was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">11,000 barrels</NUMEX> a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">15,000 barrels</NUMEX> a day to be reached in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .

     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Older Americans Freedom to Work Act</ENAMEX> , '' which would repeal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> earnings limit for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">aged 65 and older</TIMEX> , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Depression-era</TIMEX> fossil .
     For every dollar earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 8,880</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits ; it 's like a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> marginal tax .
     But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
     Imagine a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax .
     Although this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 4,930</NUMEX> to offset her catastrophic surtax of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 496</NUMEX> .
     Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> and reduce the deficit .
     Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> would lose in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefit payments .
     We now need support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Rules Committee</ENAMEX> in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill .
     Since all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-sponsors</ENAMEX> of my bill , it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor .
     The time is now to lift the burdensome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> earnings limit from the backs of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> .

     When his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> here was flying high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Purnick</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> .
     Now his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half-dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> work in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighth</NUMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> that he says is smaller than his old storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     He also says he is losing money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     He blames imports .
     But just down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX> , where about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> fur garments are made , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Rosen</ENAMEX> has acquired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">leather</ENAMEX> .
     He credits imports .
     The difference lies in how the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> entrepreneurial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 10 years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> stuck to old-line business traditions , while the other embraced the change .
     `` The small , good fur <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">salon</ENAMEX> is not
     what it used to be , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purnick</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">75 years old</TIMEX> .
     `` We make the finest product in the world , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are being kicked around . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen </ENAMEX>, though , believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">his 57 years</TIMEX> .
     `` You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively , '' he says .
     Import competition for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> furs has risen sharply since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Merchants</ENAMEX> discovered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> largely ignored by higher-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> : the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> -- even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">her late 20s</TIMEX> -- who never thought she could buy a mink .
     The new market helped boost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> fur sales to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> , triple the level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> .
     It also opened the door to furs made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jindo Furs</ENAMEX> , a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , says it operates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and plans to open <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> more by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next year</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purnick</ENAMEX> and other old-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made .
     High-end <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> say these imports have n't squeezed them .
     But low-priced and middle-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purnick</ENAMEX> , who once saturated the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-block <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX> fur district , say imports have cut their sales .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who once would have saved for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two or three seasons</TIMEX> to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 2,000</NUMEX> .
     Yet Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage .
     Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> he saw that fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in many foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> were willing to work longer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at lower wages than their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> and were more open to innovation .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , he started a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years later</TIMEX> , he opened one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     He also noticed that foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit .
     By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost .
     To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> , he says he still makes most of his furs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six years ago</TIMEX> he also began importing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> .
     Inspired by imports , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> now makes fur muffs , hats and flings .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> he produced a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green .
     He has leather jackets from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars .
     From <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> , he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs .
     Next he will be testing pictured embroidery -LRB- called kalega -RRB- made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> .
     He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets .
     Besides adding to sales , leathers also attract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> who may buy furs later , he adds .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> have also benefited from leathers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour Schreibman </ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX
     TYPE="DATE:AGE">65-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc.</ENAMEX> , treats the reverse side of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Persian</ENAMEX> lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
     He says it accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> of total sales .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> is also pushing retail sales .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> he bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Queens</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> have also placed more weight on retailing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Golden Feldman Furs Inc.</ENAMEX> began retailing aggressively <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX> , and now retail sales account for about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of gross income .
     In other moves , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> says he bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> to reach more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> .
     Since then he has expanded his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> and can now bring his furs to the front door of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> as far away as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> .
     Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> who ca n't afford to travel to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">showroom</ENAMEX> have become fair game .
     Such moves have helped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> weather the industry slump of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     The industry enjoyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six prosperous years</TIMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , but since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> sales have languished at their <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> peak .
     Large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">furriers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Antonovich Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fur Vault Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Evans Inc.</ENAMEX> all reported losses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">their latest fiscal years</TIMEX> .
     Aftereffects of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> stock market crash head the list of reasons .
     In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down .
     The animal-rights movement has n't helped sales .
     Warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winters</TIMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> have trimmed demand , too , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> complain .
     And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
     `` The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs -LCB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> . -RCB- is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schreibman </ENAMEX>, who is starting overseas production .
     But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Sanders</ENAMEX> , divisional merchandise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> 's department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     `` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purnick</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furrier </ENAMEX>.
     He contends that chasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> responds : `` Whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to buy , I 'll sell .
     The name of the game is to move goods .

     In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> promised gradual improvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> economy .
     In a speech prepared for delivery to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two weeks</TIMEX> after boosting base rates to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
     A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> ' expectations of future inflation , he argued .
     In an apparent warning to currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who have lately been selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . ''
     In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
     He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have suggested .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's financial system .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's speech , delivered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord Mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's annual dinner at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Mansion House</ENAMEX> , came on the heels of a grueling period for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> economy .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two weeks ago</TIMEX> , in a campaign to blunt inflation at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> .
     Despite the increase , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> currency slid below a perceived threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early last week</TIMEX> .
     It was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.9428 marks</NUMEX> in late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
     Unemployment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,695,000</NUMEX> , the lowest level since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     While lower joblessness is generally good news , the hefty drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped -- despite a doubling of interest rates over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the last 16 months</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , average earnings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.75 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> .
     Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 10.2 billion</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.22 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , a much higher level than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> had predicted .
     In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> , conceded that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated '' when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> economy was heating up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     He added that `` there 's no quick-fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said `` tight monetary policy is the right approach . ''
     Discussing the recent slide in stock prices , the central bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> stated that `` the markets now appear to have steadied '' after the `` nasty jolt '' of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week ago</TIMEX> .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> market plunge prompted a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70.5</NUMEX>-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> economy . ''
     Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .
     Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> repeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .

     The product is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> 's new <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">32-bit</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486tm</ENAMEX> microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> world-wide to announce a product based on the chip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early next year</TIMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     `` What this means is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> will have these machines in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">offices</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> do , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> be one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> out on the market with this product , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Meagher Davis</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti </ENAMEX>, whose earnings have been steadily sliding over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past couple of years</TIMEX> , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> said the new machines could steal some sales away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbrokers</ENAMEX> and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> 's profits tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of this year</TIMEX> , she believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> 's restructuring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last fall</TIMEX> and its introduction of new products will begin to bear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit</ENAMEX> with an earnings rebound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     `` We think the worst is over '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> information-technology market , she said .
     Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals -LRB- a role usually filled by a minicomputer -RRB- , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
     `` It 's the missing link '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> will continue making its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LSX</ENAMEX> minicomputer line .
     The machines will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 16,250</NUMEX> on average in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">486</ENAMEX> chip can process <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">15 million instructions per second</NUMEX> , or MIPS , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 's previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">386</ENAMEX> chip could handle <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">only 3 to 6 MIPS</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX> also plans to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">CP486</ENAMEX> computer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Olivetti USA</ENAMEX> and through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ISC\/Bunker Ramo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , which specializes in automating bank-branch networks .

     The higher payments will start with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> checks received on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 3 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     Supplemental Security Income payments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled</ENAMEX> also will rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> , starting with checks received on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 29 , 1988</TIMEX> , increasing the maximum SSI payment to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 386</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 368</NUMEX> a month .
     The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust fund will rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,400</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .

     Health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> should get healthier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Medical-supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> are expected to report earnings increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> on average for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , despite sales increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     To offset sluggish sales growth , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have been cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , mostly through attrition , and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
     Sales growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> was slowed by mounting pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> , to hold down prices .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Suppliers</ENAMEX> were also hurt by the stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar , which makes sales abroad more difficult .
     In some cases , competition has squeezed margins .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     The new line is aimed directly at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp</ENAMEX> .
     `` Until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Steinkrauss</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of investor relations .
     He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> shares rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.375</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 89.75</NUMEX> apiece in consolidated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said that against the backdrop of a nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
     Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
     `` I think the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next few quarters</TIMEX> will be difficult , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Milunovich</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> .
     `` Margins will remain under pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
     '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milunovich</ENAMEX> said he was revising his estimate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">current year</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.20</NUMEX> a share to `` well below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8</NUMEX> , '' although he has n't settled on a final number .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> troubling aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> 's results , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said , was its performance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> said its overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , which now accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of sales , improved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     It even took the unusually frank step of telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> conference call that orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms .
     That gain probably translated into <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 % to 7 %</NUMEX> in dollar terms , well below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent quarters</TIMEX> ' gains of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 20 %</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reckons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Stevens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds</ENAMEX> .
     `` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Schulman</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UBS Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , dropped his estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">full-year</TIMEX> net to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.80</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8</NUMEX> .
     Although overall revenues were stronger , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulman</ENAMEX> said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> `` drew down its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall .
     `` The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulman</ENAMEX> said he believes that the roll-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> 's new mainframe will `` occur somewhat more leisurely '' than many of his investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> expect .
     He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> , with all of the more sophisticated versions out by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     For reasons he would n't elaborate on , he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met , meaning less profit impact from the product for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DEC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few quarters</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX> , bolstered by strong sales in its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> business and surprisingly healthy profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> said net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06</NUMEX> a share , on sales that increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> .
     In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> posted net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">88 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> 's results included earnings from discontinued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuben Mark </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful increase in operating profit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     Operating profit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> household products and personal care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , which include such well-known brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toothpaste</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Fab</ENAMEX> laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , blending together <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and more carefully focusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's promotional activities .
     `` We 've done a lot to improve -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> . -RRB- results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> said .
     `` Improving profitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> is an extremely high priority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's results were at the high end of the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' forecasts .
     The scope of the improvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> caught some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> by surprise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , especially its household products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , has performed poorly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , net increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 217.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.09</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.79</NUMEX> a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> net income included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">59 cents</NUMEX> a share , from discontinued operations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> sold its hospital supply and home health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> finalized an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MacroChem Corp.</ENAMEX> , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Billerica</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , to market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MacroChem</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX>-approved dental products .

     The move is part of a drive to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> 's business with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> , a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USACafes Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> said it completed the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonanza</ENAMEX> restaurant franchise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">system</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Metromedia Co.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</NUMEX> in cash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USACafes</ENAMEX> , which is nearly half-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wyly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bonanza</ENAMEX> franchise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">system</ENAMEX> , which generates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 600 million</NUMEX> in sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , represented substantially all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> 's assets .
     The sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">system</ENAMEX> has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Delaware</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USACafes</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> that it hopes will enable it to save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> also said net income rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said its amended pension program will nearly double to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34,000</NUMEX> the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said that based on studies of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have offered retirement plans , it expects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> of its eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to retire under the new program .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's markets .
     Net income rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 699 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65 cents</NUMEX> a share , from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 587 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue edged up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.9 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.81 billion</NUMEX> .
     The latest period 's net was reduced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 102 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine cents</NUMEX> a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
     The results roughly matched estimates of securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> , who were encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> increasing its operating margin to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
     Sales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.4 %</NUMEX> .
     But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
     Under the amended pension program , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least five years</TIMEX> of service will have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> who retire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 30</TIMEX> will have an additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> added to their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> pension for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as long as five years</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 65</TIMEX> , whichever comes earlier .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would likely replace <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who choose to retire with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several months</TIMEX> .
     `` This tells you <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>-a-year earnings growth , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc</ENAMEX> .
     But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
     `` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel D. Gross</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> said he had hoped that a cost savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450 million</NUMEX> would result in even greater growth than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> earnings increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> it expects in the future .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said the special retirement option will increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> expenses .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> opt to retire .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ing . C. Olivetti & Co.</ENAMEX> for shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Industriali Riunite</ENAMEX> , an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Italian</TIMEX> holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said net income was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.99 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.85</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.67 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.56</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26.81 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26 billion</NUMEX> .
     In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43.375</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 cents</NUMEX> .
