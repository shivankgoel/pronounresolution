     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it plans to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">51-day</TIMEX> cash-management bills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , raising all new cash .
     The bills will be dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> and will mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 21</TIMEX> ,
     No non-competitive tenders will be accepted .
     Tenders , available in minimum denominations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> , must be received by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Banks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branches</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> also announced details of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's unusual bill auction , which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">13-week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">27-week</TIMEX> bills will be issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 2</TIMEX> , as originally planned .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> bills will still mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Feb. 1 , 1990</TIMEX> , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 3 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> also said noncompetitive tenders will be considered timely if postmarked no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 29</TIMEX> , and received no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> said it wo n't be able to honor reinvestment requests from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of bills maturing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 2</TIMEX> held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's book-entry system .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> will make payment for bills maturing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 2</TIMEX> to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who have requested reinvestment of their bills on that date , as well as to all account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> who have previously requested payment .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Pioneer Inc.</ENAMEX> said it agreed in principle to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Pioneer Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HBJ Insurance Cos.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Pioneer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Pioneer Savings Bank</ENAMEX> , said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> for the thrift holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Recently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> of both the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and convert all preferred into common shares .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements .
     The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> , including the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Indiana</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Pioneer</ENAMEX> reported a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.3 million</NUMEX> , compared with net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.7 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , largely because of problem real-estate loans , while the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 884,000</NUMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> employment data -- also could turn out to be the most confusing .
     On the surface , the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</NUMEX> .
     But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , strikes , and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> said .
     The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155,000</NUMEX> compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209,000</NUMEX> increase .
     But the important factory-jobs segment , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> plunged by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> and raised recession fears , is most likely to be skewed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> 's unusual events .
     Several other reports come before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's jobs data , including : the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> leading indicators index , new-home sales and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> agricultural prices reports due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> ; the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> ' index and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> construction spending and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' orders on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> ; and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> chain-store sales on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> brings the final count on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> sales .
     `` The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Englund</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MMS International</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englund</ENAMEX> added that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> 's data is n't likely to be much better , because it will be distorted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's earthquake .
     What 's more , he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> are n't occurring at the same time as in the past , because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">seasonal</TIMEX> adjustments built into the employment data .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> 's report from the purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will be watched to see if the index maintains a level <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</NUMEX> , as it has for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past couple of months</TIMEX> .
     A reading of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</NUMEX> indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 50 %</NUMEX> indicates an economy that 's expanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel D. Kahan</ENAMEX> , chief financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> ' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> .
     But he added : `` Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> ' index as a leading indicator , some use it as a coincident indicator .
     But the thing it 's supposed to measure -- manufacturing strength -- it missed altogether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wyss</ENAMEX> , chief financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Data Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> ' index `` does miss occasionally , '' adding : `` When it misses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one month</TIMEX> it tends to miss the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , too . ''
     The consensus view on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> leading indicators calls for a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> , the same as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> said greatly increased consumer optimism , a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index .
     All orders-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">components</ENAMEX> , such as consumer-goods orders and building permits , are thought to have been weaker .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Data Resources</ENAMEX> ' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyss</ENAMEX> added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> chain-store sales .
     Usually , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> `` is n't a very interesting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> -LCB- for retail figures -RCB- because school clothes have been bought and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are waiting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> to buy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> presents , '' he said .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyss</ENAMEX> said he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> ' general buying habits may slack off as much as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX>-buying apparently has .
     He noted that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> totals .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Seasonal</TIMEX> factors are also expected to have taken their toll on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> new-home sales , which are believed to have fallen sharply from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">755,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> .
     Construction spending is believed to have slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.5 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> levels , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> noted the rate probably will pick up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead</TIMEX> in response to hurricane and earthquake damage .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Factory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are buying new machinery at a good rate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> , machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> say , but sluggish sales of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> raise questions about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> demand from the important automotive industry .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> orders for machine tools rebounded from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> doldrums , but remained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 %</NUMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> levels , according to figures from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NMTBA</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Association for Manufacturing Technology</ENAMEX> .
     Domestic machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 303 million</NUMEX> of orders <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 227.1 million</NUMEX> , but still below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 328.2 million</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NMTBA</ENAMEX> said .
     Machine tools are complex machines ranging from lathes to metal-forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts .
     `` Overall demand still is very respectable , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher C. Cole</ENAMEX> , group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cincinnati Milacron Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> .
     `` The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> orders for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , in fact , were slightly above the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> average for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a good year</TIMEX> for the industry .
     `` Aerospace orders are very good , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> says .
     `` And export business is still good .
     While some automotive programs have been delayed , they have n't been canceled . ''
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> was one of the biggest order <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> in our history , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James R. Roberts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , world-wide sales and marketing , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fond du Lac</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wis</ENAMEX> .
     At a recent meeting of manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , `` everybody I talked with was very positive , '' he says .
     Most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> .
     But sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>-made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX>-model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> are running at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six million</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> sales also are off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , who began deferring some equipment purchases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> , can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales do n't pick up , machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> say .
     Machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are hopeful , however , that recent developments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> will expand markets for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made machine tools in that region .
     There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> as those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> as well as the quality of their goods .
     However , there 's a continuing dispute between machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Department</ENAMEX> over whether sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> machine tools would increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> 's military might .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> says go , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense Department</ENAMEX> says stop , '' complains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> .
     If that controversy continues , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> and other foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> are likely to grab most of the sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> orders for machining centers , lathes , milling machines , grinders , boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 192.9 million</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 266.5 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , but a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 156.3 million</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NMTBA</ENAMEX> said .
     Orders <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> for metal-forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110.1 million</NUMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 %</NUMEX> rise from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 61.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> gain from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70.9 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's presses are large and costly machines , and a few orders can produce a high total for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one month</TIMEX> that does n't necessarily indicate a trend .
     Machine tool shipments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 281.2 million</NUMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> rise from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Shipments have run well ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all year</TIMEX> , as machine tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> produce against relatively good backlogs .

     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bombay</ENAMEX> stock market circles , the buzzword is `` mega . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are coming to the capital market to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> , an amount never thought possible in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> .
     `` When they talk mega-issues , they 're truly talking mega , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.A. Dave</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities and Exchange Board of India</ENAMEX> .
     `` The capital market is booming . ''
     But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> capital market .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading .
     Moreover , in the relatively unregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> stock markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue .
     A prospectus in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> does n't always tell a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> much .
     Some of the large amounts are being raised by small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , once money is raised , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> usually have no way of knowing how it is spent .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are concerned that the mega-issues , in such an unregulated environment , could lead to a mega-crash .
     `` The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.S. Patel</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the giant , government-run mutual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">fund</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Unit Trust of India</ENAMEX> .
     `` They 're going to have mega-problems . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> stock markets have been on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> high , with dips and corrections , since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajiv Gandhi</ENAMEX> started liberalizing industry .
     But the last stock market boom , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , seems small compared with the current rush to market .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> that some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are looking to raise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ending March 31</TIMEX> compares with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 2.7 billion</NUMEX> raised on the capital market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous fiscal year</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1984</TIMEX> , before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> came to power , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 810 million</NUMEX> was raised .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> 's biggest issue , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</NUMEX> of convertible debentures by engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd.</ENAMEX> , is the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> history .
     And it is n't the only giant issue : together , the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> issues will raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</NUMEX> .
     Convertible debentures -- bonds that can later be converted into equity shares -- are the most popular instrument <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , though many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares .
     These mega-issues are being propelled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors , economic and political .
     In the past , the socialist policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> strictly limited the size of new steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mills</ENAMEX> , petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> and other industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> to conserve resources and restrict the profits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> could make .
     As a result , industry operated out of small , expensive , highly inefficient industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> came to power , he ushered in new rules for business .
     He said industry should build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> on the same scale as those outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> and benefit from economies of scale .
     If the output was too great for the domestic market , he said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> should export .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> 's overregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> had to be persuaded , but they have started to think big .
     Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's policy , and they require more capital than the smaller industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> built in the past .
     The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market , which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , where interest rates for prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> are around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> factor spurring mega-issues is political .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> has called general elections for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> fear that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- I -RRB- Party will lose .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are raising money in anticipation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> less predictable than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> 's , and possibly more restrictive .
     The buoyant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bombay</ENAMEX> rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections .
     No one admits to anything , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists</ENAMEX> have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations .
     So far , the mega-issues are a hit with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co.</ENAMEX> 's offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 355 million</NUMEX> of convertible debentures was oversubscribed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Essar Gujarat Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a marine construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , had similar success with a slightly smaller issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Larsen &amp; Toubro</ENAMEX> started accepting applications for its giant issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect it to be oversubscribed .
     Still to come are big issues by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bindal Agro Chem Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a petrochemical and agrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Usha Rectifier Corp .</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">semiconductor maker</ENAMEX> .
     While many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues , prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stock exchanges</ENAMEX> are holding up so far .
     `` I do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patel</ENAMEX> , `` only a sagging tendency . ''
     Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.J. Pherwani</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Unit Trust of India</ENAMEX> : The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before . ''
     But with growth come growing pains , and never has this been clearer on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> capital market than now .
     In the past , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> controlled the markets indirectly , through its tight grip on industry itself .
     Various ministries decided the products <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> could produce and how much ; and government-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> came through on promised plans .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has been content with this far-reaching , subtle form of control , exercised on a case-by-case basis with no clear rules or guidelines .
     But now , with large amounts being raised from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> was set up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> , along the lines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Delhi</ENAMEX> has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> , acts cheery and patient , but he makes no bones about the need to get to work .
     `` Mega or non-mega , we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved , '' he says .
     `` Disclosures are very poor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> . ''
     He says the big questions -- `` Do you really need this much money to put up these investments ? Have you told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> what is happening in your sector ? What about your track record ? -- `` are n't asked of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> coming to market .
     Instead , he says , most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have to rely on the rumor-happy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">press</ENAMEX> .
     An example is the biggest offering of them all , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Larsen &amp; Toubro</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</NUMEX> bond issue .
     The engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was acquired in a takeover <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> textile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Larsen &amp; Toubro</ENAMEX> had n't raised money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">38 years</TIMEX> , its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> frequently raise funds on the local market .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> floated a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 357 million</NUMEX> petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> that was , at the time , the largest public issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> history . -RRB-
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">media</ENAMEX> has raised questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Larsen &amp; Toubro</ENAMEX> 's issue , pointing out that it exceeds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> sales and its market capitalization .
     Even stranger is the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Usha Rectifier</ENAMEX> , a semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million</NUMEX> that 's raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 270 million</NUMEX> to build an iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     Once the money is raised , it is n't always certain how it is used .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Larsen &amp; Toubro</ENAMEX> , for example , says it 's raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 570 million</NUMEX> to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs .
     Unlike other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , it has n't pin-pointed specific projects for the funds .
     And even when specific projects are described in prospectuses , the money often is used elsewhere , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     `` Someone must monitor where the funds are deployed , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patel</ENAMEX> agrees : `` There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds .
     They 're trying to plug the various loopholes , but they 're totally unprepared for this . ''
     Because of the large amounts of money being raised , the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> fear that there could be a few mega-crashes , which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> insists that such a possibility is low .
     It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself , its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> restrictions prevent any single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder</ENAMEX> from going beyond <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1990</TIMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> permission .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , on the other hand , has said it 's willing to bid for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , despite the objections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Egan</ENAMEX> .

     It 's a script pieced together from interviews by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> for a re-enactment , a dramatic rendering by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression .
     The segment is soon to be broadcast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> series `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Saturday Night With Connie Chung</ENAMEX> , '' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news .
     It is the New Journalism come to television .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> 's program is just one of several network shows -LRB- and many more in syndication -RRB- that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events , using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> who are supposed to resemble real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , living and dead .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> 's , however , is said to be the only network news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">program</ENAMEX> in history to employ casting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX> in this case is to be played by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lieber</ENAMEX> , who is n't new to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> .
     He was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> production of a play called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">The Chicago Conspiracy Trial</ENAMEX> . ''
     Television news , of course , has always been part show-biz .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Broadcasters</ENAMEX> have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     But , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Broadcast Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stringer</ENAMEX> puts it , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> now needs to `` broaden the horizons of nonfiction television , and that includes some experimentation . ''
     Since its premiere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 16</TIMEX> , the show on which Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> appears has used an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> to portray the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Johns</ENAMEX> , a civil-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , and one to play a teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> .
     It has depicted the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 21</TIMEX> , it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Anderson</ENAMEX> , who was abducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1985</TIMEX> and is believed to be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lebanon .</ENAMEX>
     The production had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> playing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Jacobsen</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Weir</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Jenco</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Prime Time Live</ENAMEX> , '' a new show <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this season</TIMEX> featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Sawyer</ENAMEX> , has a studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that applauds and that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> -LRB- to the embarrassment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> -RRB- waved at the camera like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Let 's Make a Deal</ENAMEX> . ''
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ABC</ENAMEX> stops short of using an `` applause '' sign and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic</ENAMEX> to warm up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> do that themselves . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> has produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> episodes of an occasional series produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid Feders</ENAMEX> called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow</ENAMEX> , '' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Shriver</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Scarborough</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Alice Williams</ENAMEX> , that also gives work to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> .
     Call it a fad .
     Or call it the wave of the future .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC</ENAMEX> 's re-creations are produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cosgrove-Meurer Productions</ENAMEX> , which also makes the successful prime-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> series `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Unsolved Mysteries</ENAMEX> . ''
     The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated nonetheless .
     News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> ' cost-conscious corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000</NUMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> program .
     Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that .
     Re-enactments have been used successfully for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several seasons</TIMEX> on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">A Current Affair</ENAMEX> , '' which is produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fox Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">News Corp</ENAMEX> .
     That show , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Povich</ENAMEX> , has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chambers</ENAMEX> murder case , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Lowe</ENAMEX> tapes , what have you .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Stone</ENAMEX> , the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">A Current Affair</ENAMEX> , '' says , `` We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news . ''
     Nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:ADDRESS">555 W. 57th St.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">floor</ENAMEX> below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> , '' the most successful prime-time news program ever , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> wait in the reception area to audition for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Saturday Night With Connie Chung</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> sends scripts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> , who pass them along to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> deals a lot with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unknowns</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Wentworth</ENAMEX> , who portrayed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Alton</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenco</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> has some big names to contend with , too .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Earl Jones</ENAMEX> is cast to play the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johns</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Beatty</ENAMEX> may portray former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Brown</ENAMEX> in a forthcoming epsiode on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caryl Chessman</ENAMEX> , the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to be executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Saturday Night</ENAMEX> '' has cast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 4</TIMEX> segment on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Bosket</ENAMEX> , who calls himself a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> '' and is reputed to be the toughest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> , which as recently as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> fired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in budget cutbacks , now hires featured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> beginning at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,700</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a week</TIMEX> .
     That is n't much compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> makes , or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX> for that matter -LRB- who is paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 million</NUMEX> a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- .
     But the money is n't peanuts either , particularly for a news program .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is also re-enacting the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Three Mile Island</ENAMEX> nuclear accident in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Middletown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , with something less than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> .
     It is combing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extras</ENAMEX> .

     `` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Sukle</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Press and Journal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Middletown .</ENAMEX>

     What is driving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> as they grow in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended March 31</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.9 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.5 billion</NUMEX> , and net income jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 102 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 64 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's billings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> were larger than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Young &amp; Rubicam</ENAMEX> , the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , according to a survey by the publication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advertising Age</ENAMEX> .
     But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> .
     On its own , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> 's muscle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> .
     Thus , an acquisition may prove the necessary course .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> do business with rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> in the same industry , a practice `` that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Warman</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ENAMEX> 's communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     Although acquiring a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would expand <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> ' business to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> would also be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> expanding overseas , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     But the different business system would make it hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> to provide these <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> the same kind of services they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .

     The announcements are scheduled to be made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Temple</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , and include a so-called `` notebook '' PC that weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">less than seven pounds</NUMEX> , has a built-in hard disk drive and is powered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">286</ENAMEX> microprocessor .
     That introduction comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only two weeks</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> , believing it had a lead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three to six months</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> , introduced the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> notebook computer with such features .
     Despite the inevitable comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> ' new notebook wo n't be a direct competitor .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> sells its machines to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> through computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> .
     The introductions also mark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> ' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past several years</TIMEX> .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> introduced the first portable data terminal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> -- a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">38-pound</NUMEX> monster -- and the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> microprocessor-based portable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> , the only portable machines it has introduced since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the decade</TIMEX> have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability .
     It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago .
     Now that is about to change , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> begins marketing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">two 14-pound</NUMEX> laptop PCs with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">20 megabyte</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">40 megabyte</NUMEX> hard drives .
     The laptops are not revolutionary and , indeed , are tardy in a market first opened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GRiD Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> , now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">almost two years ago</TIMEX> .
     But the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk , is more innovative .
     Weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">6.7 pounds</NUMEX> with battery , the notebook measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">8.2 by 11.7 inches</NUMEX> , has a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">20-megabyte</NUMEX> hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's .
     Its keyboard , according to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> , is better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> 's , but its battery life of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two to three hours</TIMEX> is shorter .
     It does n't have an internal floppy disk drive , although a snap-on drive can be purchased separately .
     Its greatest drawback may be its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3-inch</NUMEX> thickness , big enough for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to describe it as `` clunky . ''
     List prices on the heavier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instrument</ENAMEX> laptops will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4,999</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">TI Model 25</ENAMEX> , with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">20 megabyte</NUMEX> disk drive , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,599</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">40-megabyte</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Model 45</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> and parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> are entering the critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas shopping season</TIMEX> with more momentum than those in other regions .
     In a new report , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Council of Shopping Centers</ENAMEX> said sales of general merchandise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first seven months of 1989</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.6 %</NUMEX> above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> levels .

     But sales in the oil-patch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> surged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.9 %</NUMEX> and sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.6 %</NUMEX> in the period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> said .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> , however , sales declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> in the period , with sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">New England</ENAMEX> falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 %</NUMEX> .
     The numbers show that `` we do n't have a monolithic economy , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Lagnado</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">council research director</ENAMEX> .
     `` There are a lot of have and have-not markets . ''
     Sales nationally rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest month</TIMEX> for which the figures are available , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">council</ENAMEX> said .
     The Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> predicted the regional trends would continue through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> .
     `` The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics , '' he said .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas quarter</TIMEX> is important to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> because it represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly a third</NUMEX> of their sales and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of their profits .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">council</ENAMEX> 's report is based on data the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> buys from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Census Bureau</ENAMEX> .
     The information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> metropolitan markets is supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears , Roebuck &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> as well as closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">R.H.

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">El Paso</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Austin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strongest retail <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">markets</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , are all located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , where employment grew a relatively strong <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries , was the weakest link in bleak <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">New England</ENAMEX> .
     The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West</ENAMEX> had the slowest sales growth , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> respectively , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">council</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> said that although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> probably wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , they could see some benefits later on .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Stores</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears</ENAMEX> that sell big-ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> may see claims resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 1 billion</NUMEX> -- far less than the claims they face from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months</TIMEX> .
     The property claims service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Insurance Services Group</ENAMEX> estimated insured losses from the earthquake at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 960 million</NUMEX> .
     This estimate does n't include claims under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ' compensation , life , health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> and public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> .
     The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> in claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> face from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , which ripped through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     That 's because <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 30 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> had earthquake insurance to cover the losses .
     However , insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> say that the combination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's explosion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pasadena</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump .
     Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance , which would cover liability claims , are n't likely to firm right away , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Cornish</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northington Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Avon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn</ENAMEX> .
     She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes is n't likely to halt the growth of the industry 's surplus capital <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> believe .
     `` The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Rosencrants</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Interstate\/Johnson Lane Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> -- a reinsurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , which , in turn , accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Transamerica Corp</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co.</ENAMEX> , buy reinsurance from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's of London</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> catastrophe at a time .
     After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> hit , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     After the earthquake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syndicates</ENAMEX> turned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market excess lines for protection of their own .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snedeker</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gill &amp; Roeser Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based reinsurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> who took big losses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> and had purchased little reinsurance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with few catastrophe losses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and already big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat , or perhaps even decline slightly .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will be negotiating their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> reinsurance contracts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few weeks</TIMEX> .
     `` It 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> 's market , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snedeker</ENAMEX> of the reinsurance market right now .
     But some large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , do n't purchase reinsurance , but fund their own program .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , stopped buying reinsurance because no one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> could provide all the coverage that it needed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> found it cheaper to self-reinsure .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 472 million</NUMEX> of losses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> expects from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 300 million</NUMEX> from the earthquake are less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.7 billion</NUMEX> total net worth .
     Since few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake , it 's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake 's impact on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> earnings , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Goodfriend</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Corp</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Transamerica</ENAMEX> expects an after-tax charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 3 million</NUMEX> against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> net ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hartford Insurance Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX> , expects a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> after-tax charge ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> expects a charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">no more than $ 50 million</NUMEX> before taxes and after using its reinsurance .
