     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Financial Services Inc.</ENAMEX> , charging that program trading is ruining the stock market , cut off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> big Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> from doing any of its stock-trading business .
     The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper</ENAMEX> putting its money -- the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> in commissions it generates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> -- where its mouth is .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices , such as on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">16</TIMEX> , and has increased chances for market crashes .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past nine months</TIMEX> , several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , including discount broker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Schwab &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears , Roebuck &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , have attacked program trading as a major market evil .
     Several big securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> backed off from program trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few months</TIMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     But most of them , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , moved back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire , computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options .
     The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves .
     Index arbitrage recently has accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of all program trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , program trading accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.9 million</NUMEX> shares a day , or a record <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> inside and outside these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> confirmed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> declined to identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and said the list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> it wo n't do business with may be lengthened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the months ahead</TIMEX> .
     `` We 've been opposed to '' index arbitrage `` for a long time , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen B. Timbers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper </ENAMEX>, which manages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 billion</NUMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 billion</NUMEX> of stocks .
     `` Index arbitrage does n't work , and it scares natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> '' of stock .
     While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbers</ENAMEX> explained he 's `` not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market , '' he said that `` on an intraday basis , it has major effects .
     We 've talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're ruining the market .
     They said , ` Too bad , ' so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper</ENAMEX> also blasted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holders</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> has vested interests '' in its big member securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> `` that cloud its objectivity , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbers</ENAMEX> said .
     `` It has never been interested in what we think .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> also has a terrible communication problem with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , '' he added .
     Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> perceive that `` big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> '' dominate the market , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas O'Hara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Individual Investors Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> set up after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it -LCB- program trading -RCB- , but they -LCB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> -RCB- ca n't do it , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan</ENAMEX> said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
     He said the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> can do is `` slow down the process '' by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbers</ENAMEX> countered that `` the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biggest program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , staunchly defend their strategies .
     `` We continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> , said in a recent interview , `` We do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole . ''
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Eckenfelder</ENAMEX> , a securities industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kemper</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> to make a major statement with program trading . ''
     He added that `` having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> do this is n't going to mean a hill of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beans</ENAMEX> .
     But if this prompts others to consider the same thing , then it may become much more important .

     At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Levy</ENAMEX> should be planning the biggest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring</TIMEX> season in his dress <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">17 years</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">his work day</TIMEX> is studded with intense moments of concern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> of his biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp</ENAMEX> .
     `` The dress business has always been a gamble , but it 's never been like this , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St. Gillian Group Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy TV commercials .

     `` I 'm now monitoring every major account . ''

     The need for the loan surprised many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> who had been told at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> that there were n't any major problems ahead .

     Orders from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> used to be cause for celebration .
     This is no longer true because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> 's massive debt load .

     But those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">spring</TIMEX> goods to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> , hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit .
     Separately , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Intergroup Inc.</ENAMEX> -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , marking what is generally believed to be the end of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> boom in the industry .
     Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect the disappointing trend to continue into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> and through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least the first two quarters of 1990</TIMEX> , when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines , such as rolled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sheet</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , appliances and construction .
     `` It does n't bode well for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming quarters</TIMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jacobson</ENAMEX> , who follows the steel industry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AUS Consultants</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , he thinks several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> will report actual losses through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1990</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> , earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     The figures include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> in costs related to a blast furnace outage and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> in losses from unauthorized work outages at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's coal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago</TIMEX> period , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 101.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.27</NUMEX> a share , including a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.8 million</NUMEX> gain from early retirement of debt .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> sales dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.27 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.43 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> shares rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.375</NUMEX> .
     Of all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown .
     It has n't diversified beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , nor has it linked up with a joint venture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> to share costs and risks .
     However , in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> `` had pretty good earnings numbers , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Galanter Applebaum</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Applebaum</ENAMEX> had estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55 cents</NUMEX> a share , but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> 's core basic steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> experienced a steep drop in operating profit to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58.6 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 186.4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> , a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market .
     At the same time , production costs , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs , which resulted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's new labor pact effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1</TIMEX> .
     `` We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> as the automotive sector remains weak and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> continue to adjust inventories , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter F. Williams</ENAMEX> .
     He noted , however , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's order entry has increased from the low levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early summer</TIMEX> , following the end of labor negotiations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco</ENAMEX> , hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 cents</NUMEX> a share in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago quarter</TIMEX> .
     Sales dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 441.1 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 820.4 million</NUMEX> , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> no longer consolidates its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern Steel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , which is now a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kawasaki Steel Corp .</ENAMEX>

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> here , said it invited many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to participate as well , including some from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kuehler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is also considering letting other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> it was inviting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry to head off the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> worries that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> will take over that equipment market , too , unless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> produce enough memory chips here to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> healthy .
     Failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> fears , would leave it dependent on many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that compete with it in other parts of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> already participates in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
     A state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> but costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> because the technology is so complex .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it expects the costs to continue climbing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> is paying just a nominal fee to cover the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">21-month</TIMEX> agreement , acknowledged some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> had turned down its invitation to join in .
     But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it thought more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would become interested as the project progresses .
     The project involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
     Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film .
     But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one .
     X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
     X-rays have problems , too .
     They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they 're not supposed to .
     But , assuming those problems can be overcome , they should allow for memory chips that could approach <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">one billion bits</NUMEX> of information -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> times as much as is contained in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:OTHER">four-megabit</NUMEX> chips that are just reaching the market and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> times what was possible in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> .

     In a stunning shift in direction , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Provigo Inc.</ENAMEX> said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     The non-food operations accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 27 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Provigo</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.38 billion Canadian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 6.3 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- in sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest fiscal year</TIMEX> .

     Comments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> lent some support to the dollar , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> unit ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> lower against most major currencies .
     Foreign-exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> noted that the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>, whose statements are ordinarily cautious , was especially careful to avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets .
     Testifying before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> .
     `` Our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said , referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy .
     In perhaps his most telling remark , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> termed the current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> inflation rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 4.5 %</NUMEX> as `` much too high to be ignored . ''
     He added , however , that inflation could be brought down `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX> '' without throwing the economy into a recession .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> viewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's comments as an indication that the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> is disinclined to ease monetary policy further in the near future .
     The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>'s testimony , settling lower in later trade as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> squared positions ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's preliminary report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> gross national product .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the dollar was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8353 marks</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8355 marks</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.52 yen</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> .

     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.60 yen</NUMEX> , up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.55 yen</NUMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> forecast a continuation of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower .
     But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Madison</ENAMEX> , a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , a large number of short positions must first be corrected , spurring a temporary upswing , before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> can turn lower .
     He predicts a downward move in dollar-mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar-yen , noting that there continues to be a large pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investor interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities , which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">140 yen</NUMEX> .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> hope <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's GNP report will offer more substantial evidence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic growth , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are quick to point out that the figures may overstate the economy 's vigor .
     `` The ` r ' word is looming again , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> , referring to persistent concern among some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> note that while the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> figures may appear relatively bullish -- the market consensus calls for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> annual growth rate , unchanged from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">second-quarter</TIMEX> rate -- it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> reckon that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next quarter</TIMEX> 's figures will present a more accurate picture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy , showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors , including housing starts and equities .

     Wall Street would like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> to change its mind about keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> independent .
     But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most powerful and fractious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> : the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> buy-out , if anything , may have strengthened the hands of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , both may now have virtual veto power over any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> transaction .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> -- likely to react to any new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal with even more caution than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike , '' said an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fuji Bank</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> .
     `` If you have both -LCB- labor -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> on strike , you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to be looking at . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just this past week</TIMEX> , a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> asked for a meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> ' union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to determine where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible .
     Another reason : Emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> are likely to be more aggressive if a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> buy-out attempt occurs .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> already had significant leverage simply because their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> has yet to settle with either on new contracts .
     That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work .
     Thus , even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who are pushing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> to do a recapitalization that would pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> a special dividend and possibly grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> an ownership stake acknowledge that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> are key .
     `` There 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> ' cooperation and wage concessions , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nye </ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baker , Nye Investments</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> takeover stock-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nye</ENAMEX> thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here , '' pilot union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick C. Dubinsky</ENAMEX> declared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     But whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> can team up with their longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> , is another question .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubinsky</ENAMEX> says his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> would like majority ownership for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     At the very least , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> want some form of control over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , perhaps through super-majority voting rights .
     On the other hand , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> have always opposed majority ownership in principle , saying they do n't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> should be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> .
     Still , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> ' union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have shown some new flexibility .
     `` We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate -LCB- the pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's -RCB- concerns and ours , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian M. Freeman</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> ' financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> ' union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> plan to meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , an employee stake and , perhaps , an equity investment by a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> .
     If a compromise ca n't be reached , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> .
     But at this point , that may just be wishful thinking .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> lobbied heavily against the original bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Their opposition helped scare off some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve .
     `` Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> ? '' asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candace Browning</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` Who would the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> be working for -- the public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ? '' she adds .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browning</ENAMEX> says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> relent on their demand for control .
     She also notes that even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> accept a minority stake now , they still could come back at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX> and try to take control .
     Another possibility is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> ' to team up with an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who might try to force the ouster of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> through the solicitation of consents .
     In that way , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> may be able to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> to approve a recapitalization that gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> a majority stake , or to consider the labor-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's latest proposal .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> did n't make a formal offer , but instead told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 225 and $ 240</NUMEX> a share .
     But again , they may need the help of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> familiar with the situation .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> , he says , `` ca n't go back '' to business as usual .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> earnings soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> to a record in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first quarter</TIMEX> , bucking the industry trend toward declining profits .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic , new international routes and reduced service by rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> , which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta</ENAMEX> posted net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 133.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.53</NUMEX> a share , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.03</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.17 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.89 billion</NUMEX> .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta</ENAMEX> issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 million</NUMEX> shares of common stock to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> , and repurchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1 million</NUMEX> shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan .
     `` The key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta</ENAMEX> 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Roeck</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> .
     Passenger traffic jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , while profit per passenger grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delta</ENAMEX> has benefited more than other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> from the weakness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> , which shares the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">hub</ENAMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> is back to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</NUMEX> of its pre-strike schedule now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> was only beginning to get back on its feet during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association</ENAMEX> , reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market , announced a loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 226.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.57</NUMEX> a share .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter a year ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> reported earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Total assets increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.7 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12.4 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The loss stems from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 357.5 million</NUMEX> of write-downs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.4 billion</NUMEX> high-yield investment securities portfolio , which includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3.7 billion</NUMEX> of junk bonds , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> of preferred stock , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> owes its spectacular growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> to its junk-bond portfolio , the largest of any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> .
     Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">neighbor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , losses totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 212 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.83</NUMEX> a share , compared with net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.11</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The results include a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130.2 million</NUMEX> write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> also added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 227.3 million</NUMEX> to reserves for losses on the portfolio , increasing general reserves to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.7 %</NUMEX> of the total portfolio , as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 30</TIMEX> , loss reserves stood at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 108.3 million</NUMEX> .
     Thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> reserve will be adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions .
     The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation , which requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> to divest all high-yield bond investments by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> .
     Previously , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments .
     Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> now must sell the bonds within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> , accounting rules require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices .
     For its future strategy , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> results also reflected <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.4 million</NUMEX> in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Spiegel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , said in a statement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> was `` disappointed '' by the effects of the accounting changes .
     But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> remains `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most strongly capitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> in the industry , '' based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> announced the results after the close of the stock market .
     Its shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.125</NUMEX> each in composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> .
     The price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> shares has been cut nearly in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , when they traded at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10</NUMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> apparently realized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> would be forced to take a big write-down .
     The stock 's decline accelerated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two weeks</TIMEX> , from a price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8</NUMEX> a share on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 9</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> 's junk bonds , because federal regulations , such as those that would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> , have n't yet been completed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrift</ENAMEX> should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements , despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 's end</TIMEX> .
     Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6 %</NUMEX> , and total equity was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 457.9 million</NUMEX> .
     The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs , which has a book value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 million</NUMEX> .
     Although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million to $ 300 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 70 million</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ENAMEX> said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands , setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> , the world 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brewer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader</ENAMEX> , has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume .
     With the passing of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the heady days</TIMEX> of swelling industry sales , however , the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> in the beer industry .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> offered more and deeper discounts than industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have seen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a long time</TIMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> now predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said major rivals , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller Brewing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX> `` have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least the past 18 months</TIMEX> '' on their premium brands , pricing their product <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as 25 cents</NUMEX> a 12-pack below <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Budweiser</ENAMEX> label in many markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> on a market-by-market basis .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX> announced its plan at the same time it reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a lower-than-anticipated 5.2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 238.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">83 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 226.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">78 cents</NUMEX> .
     Third-period sales were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.49 billion</NUMEX> , up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.34 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> said its new strategy -- started in some markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last half of 1989</TIMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     The projection sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> shares plunging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.375</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The stock closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.50</NUMEX> on heavy volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3.5 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coors</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sole publicly traded major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> apiece to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.125</NUMEX> in national over-the-counter trading , apparently on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> noted that `` beer industry sales volume is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> is following the trend that has characterized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last half of the '80s</TIMEX> , with sales volume being essentially flat '' while consolidation creates fewer , bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> .
     `` We can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> said , adding it will take `` appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy '' for the premium brands .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> said it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market share by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> .
     Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 41 %</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> beer sales and is expected to see that grow to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current year</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> is the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">bar</ENAMEX> , and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph J. Doyle</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` It 's going to get bloody . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Steinman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beer Marketers Insights</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newsletter</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> 's announcement means `` everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George E. Thompson</ENAMEX> downplayed the importance of the announcement , and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending `` cola wars , '' unwarranted .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> calls discounting `` a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">loser</ENAMEX> 's game for anyone without a dominant market share , '' and projected that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> noted that the disappointing earnings , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> a share short of his own projections , contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doyle </ENAMEX>, who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> trimmed his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> earnings projection to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.95</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.10</NUMEX> , called the market 's reaction `` justified . ''
     While the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings were a `` moderate disappointment , '' he said , `` the real bad news is the intensity of price competition '' in the premium-beer sector .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinman</ENAMEX> , the newsletter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publisher</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> 's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller Brewing </ENAMEX>, which had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.2 %</NUMEX> stake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     It 's followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stroh Brewery Co.</ENAMEX> , which has agreed to sell its assets to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coors</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stroh</ENAMEX> have recently been ceding market share to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed easier for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consecutive day , finishing at the intraday low on index-linked investment trust fund selling toward the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> session .

     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , the market opened bullishly with high turnover , ignoring the volatility in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> stocks .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">losers</ENAMEX> were spread in a broad range by the end of the session .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said that the more an issue gained recently , the sharper the loss sustained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamaichi Securities</ENAMEX> said the market 's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone</ENAMEX> shares , which declined to their lowest level since the begining of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NTT</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30,000 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,380,000 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9,756</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> noted individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> dumped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NTT</ENAMEX> shares amid growing expectation for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> as suggested by a recent government-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said they also took profits to reduce holdings in their own account at the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> transaction period .
     Among pharmaceutical shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,290 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16.20</NUMEX> -RRB- , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mochida</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,290</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,680</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sekisui House</ENAMEX> , which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2640</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa House</ENAMEX> also ended easier , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Misawa Home</ENAMEX> was firmer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pioneer Electronic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony</ENAMEX> , both of which dominated buying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> , continued to fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> share prices closed modestly higher largely on technical factors , although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall Street 's firmer trend .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market-makers</ENAMEX> looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market 's recent downtrend .
     Outside what essentially amounted to a bookkeeping exercise , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> dealings were largely dulled by the absence of active interest beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">market-makers</ENAMEX> .
     The late buying was drawn into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> added , after Wall Street showed signs of stability following its rocky opening .
     Stocks that suffered on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> were those with active <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> noted .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the shares were hit by fears of a slowdown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable &amp; Wireless</ENAMEX> benefited from a market squeeze , bouncing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">498</NUMEX> in moderately active volume .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> was boosted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">715</NUMEX> on follow-through buying after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> 's announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that it might be prepared to mount a full bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     It was further helped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , which announced after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's close that it had raised its stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 11 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> prices closed sharply lower in thin dealings , hurt by the roller-coaster session on Wall Street <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and worries about wage demands by the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> stock index tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.29</NUMEX> to end at
     `` It was dead , listless , depressing and negative , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> .
     `` There was little turnover and nothing to stimulate the market . ''
     Equities tumbled at the opening as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's gyrations on Wall Street , where the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered most of an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-point loss , fueled fears of another stock market crash , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> said .
     Tough talk from trade union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the conference of the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IG Metall</ENAMEX> metals worker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">West Berlin</ENAMEX> raised the specter of nationwide strikes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> , they said .
     For the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> wage negotiations , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IG Metall</ENAMEX> is demanding a further cut in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">workweek</TIMEX> and steep wage increases , which could sharply increase the costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> industry .
     `` All the positive figures on the economy are out already , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are focusing more on the dangers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , mostly the wage talks and the -LCB- parliamentary -RCB- elections , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said .
     The market also shrugged off positive factors , such as higher bond prices and a slowdown in monetary growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer , as trading volume is falling toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> and the market is becoming more volatile .
     In the auto sector , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bayerische Motoren Werke</ENAMEX> plunged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.5 marks</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">529 marks</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 288</NUMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daimler-Benz</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> slumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.5</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> gave up some of its recent gains , dropping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">338</NUMEX> , as rumors of an impending takeover attempt for the tiremaker faded , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Deutsche Bank</ENAMEX> plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">645</NUMEX> , hurt by the general mood .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX>-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , by a margin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> votes , failed to override <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> abortions for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of rape and incest .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">191</NUMEX> roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces .
     It continues to gain strength in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber</ENAMEX> but remains far short of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> majority required to prevail over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> voted to override by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> margin , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> were equally firm in support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> spending bills .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 156.7 billion</NUMEX> measure funding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Education</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> .
     To gain more leverage , abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> .
     But the stark numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> -- when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">282</NUMEX> votes were needed -- indicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is in a commanding position for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">at least this year</TIMEX> .
     `` Unless he changes , they lose , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> leadership <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> .
     The action came as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> a stopgap spending bill to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> operating through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> and provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     By a lopsided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> margin , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> and , despite reservations , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> adopted the bill on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">303</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX> roll call .
     The package is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</NUMEX> above the recommendations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Budget</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     But given the political importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> was content to use its influence to prevent any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> amendments adding further new appropriations .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.85 billion</NUMEX> measure comes on top of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> appropriated after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hugo</ENAMEX> struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans .
     The bill <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> sixfold to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> to accommodate the expected loan activity .
     In direct cash assistance , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> is provided in federal highway construction funds , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.35 billion</NUMEX> is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next six months</TIMEX> .
     The emergency assistance would n't be counted against a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's normal allocation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> highway funds , and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> damaged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake .
     The underlying stopgap bill is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this fall</TIMEX> and , since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the current fiscal year began Oct. 1</TIMEX> , only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Energy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law .
     The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and , apart from the health and education measure vetoed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , bills funding the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> and the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues .
     The vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was the most partisan in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> , and though the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> is ambivalent about how to address the abortion issue , the debate is increasingly measured in party terms .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who supported the override <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> compare with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> on a similar vote .
     By comparison , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> have held closer to the anti-abortion movement .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 12</NUMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the 30</NUMEX> who supported the rape-and-incest exemption <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     At a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> meeting , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silvio Conte</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the ranking minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> , argued with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> against a veto , and though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conte</ENAMEX> and Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Michel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> stood with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position .
     `` This is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the most eloquent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the anti-abortion movement .
     But after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of using the issue for its benefit , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> finds its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> on the defensive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> gubernatorial candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Florio</ENAMEX> pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in contrast with his opponent , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Courter</ENAMEX> , who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent .
     In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dornan</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB- lectured his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Roman Catholics</ENAMEX> -- including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> -- for having the `` chutzpah '' to disagree with the hierarchy of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> on abortion .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les AuCoin</ENAMEX> was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement .
     `` This may not make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , '' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> , addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     `` But if you support him over rape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> , this may be your last term . ''
     Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> approved <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nearly $ 67 billion</NUMEX> compromise spending bill providing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> construction funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's ambitious space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">station</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
     The current ceiling on home loans insured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> would be increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 124,875</NUMEX> , and the bill gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> .
     By a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">325</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> margin , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> beat back an early challenge by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> Banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gonzalez</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> provision .
     And on a closer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> roll call , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> upheld controversial agreements made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference earmarking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> development funds for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX> projects backed by often influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio `` basket '' product , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> program-trading vehicle carrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's seal of approval .
     ESPs will allow institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> to buy or sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 500</NUMEX> stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> index in a single trade of a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> .
     `` Customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> gave provisional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> approval to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> basket at a meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , where the minimum will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.7 million</NUMEX> .
     Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular hours</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midwest Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> market crash , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Grundfest</ENAMEX> .
     New <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> , overseeing his first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> meeting , said there have been concerns that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's basket could attract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ketchum</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's market regulation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . ''
     The baskets on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> -- which involve the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures markets , and index options on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> -- will begin trading as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading .
     ESPs are also an attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also hope <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will become interested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's product .
     Already , many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's own floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alliance of Floor Brokers</ENAMEX> said the new product , with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> minimum , will benefit only big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stockbrokers</ENAMEX> who cater to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's new product confirms the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> does n't want to curtail program trading , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> accounted for a record <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is losing its cool here , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Andrews</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of institutional trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ' accord would provide the first restitution to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boesky &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , once the largest arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who bought and sold securities in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> were dealing .

     An agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> regarding the limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> ' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back .
     This is because a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Delaware</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> had said it would not be able to begin processing the request until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferguson </ENAMEX>, who is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">68 years old</TIMEX> , fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970</TIMEX> after exhausting his appeals of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1968</TIMEX> conviction on conspiracy to murder .

     He maintains that the information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> will help him get his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1968</TIMEX> conviction vacated and his bail-jumping indictment dismissed .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> claim he was framed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">police</ENAMEX> as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> .
     Because the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX> was n't law at that time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FBI</ENAMEX> was n't required to turn over information on its investigations when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferguson</ENAMEX> appealed his conviction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> .

     Complex cases , such as antitrust suits and many business disputes , would receive intense supervision by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> to keep pretrial proceedings moving .
     Standard cases would require less judicial attention , and fast-track cases could be resolved quickly .
     The study also said each federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence , ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as much as 100 days</TIMEX> for cases in the fast track to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as much as 18 months</TIMEX> for complex disputes .
     And the study said federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> should set firm trial dates early in the process .
     To take advantage of local expertise and custom , the study said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> should require each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases .
     Although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects , the makeup of the task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> was unusually diverse , adding significance to the effort .
     It included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> from civil rights and consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> , corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> .
