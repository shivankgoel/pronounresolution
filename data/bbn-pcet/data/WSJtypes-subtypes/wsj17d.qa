     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the long , frightening night</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's devastating earthquake , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
     Some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> made their way to their computers after the quake , and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards , which link computers CB-radio-style , via phone lines .
     Some of the most vivid bulletins came over <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Well</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sausalito</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About two-thirds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">the Well</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> .
     The quake knocked <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Well</ENAMEX> out for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> , but when it came back up , it teemed with emotional <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-hand reports .
     Following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> .
     The time is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Pacific Daylight Time</TIMEX> , and the initials or nicknames are those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> use to identify themselves .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JCKC</ENAMEX> :
     Wow !
     I was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">avenues</ENAMEX> , on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">floor</ENAMEX> of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , and except for my heart -LRB- Beat , BEAT ! -RRB- I 'm OK .
     Got back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bolinas</ENAMEX> , and everything had fallen : broken poster frames with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glass</ENAMEX> on the floor , file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:59 p.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JKD</ENAMEX> :
     I was in my favorite watering hole , waiting for the game to start .
     I felt the temblor begin and glanced at the table next to mine , smiled that guilty smile and we both mouthed the words , `` Earth-quake ! '' together .
     That 's usually how long it takes for the temblors to pass .
     This time , it just got stronger and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> started shaking violently up and down as though it were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 's toy block that was being tossed .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:06 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HRH</ENAMEX> :
     I was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Berkeley Main</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">library</ENAMEX> when it hit .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Endless seconds</TIMEX> wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass .
     Only a few books fell in the reading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     Then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil-looking cloud of black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">smoke</ENAMEX> into the air .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:07 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ONEZIE</ENAMEX> :
     My younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and I are fine .
     This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .
     Except for the gas tank at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hustead 's Towing Service</ENAMEX> exploding and burning in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> , things here are quite peaceful .
     A lot of car alarms went off .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are fine , although nervous .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:15 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DHAWK</ENAMEX> :
     Huge fire from broken gas main in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">SF</ENAMEX> .
     Areas that are made of ` fill ' liquefy .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">three-story</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartment</ENAMEX> was able to walk out the window of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">floor</ENAMEX> onto street level after the quake .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> just settled right down into the ground .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:38 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAYAC</ENAMEX> :
     I was driving my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> , stopped at a red light at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Shattuck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Alcatraz</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> border when it hit .
     Worst part was watching power lines waving above my head and no way to drive away .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:48 a.m</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LMEYER</ENAMEX> :
     Was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">300 ft</NUMEX>. out on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pier</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Rafael</ENAMEX> .
     It flopped all around , real dramatic !
     Many hairline cracks in the concrete slabs afterwards .
     Ruined the damn fishing !
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:00 a.m</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HEYNOW</ENAMEX> :
     I rode it out on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">floor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Leo 's</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">55th</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Telegraph</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> .
     I heard parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> above my head cracking .
     I actually thought that I might die .
     I could n't decide if I should come home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Marin</ENAMEX> , because my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> is on stilts .
     I decided to brave the storm .
     There was a horrible smell of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> as I passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> before crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Richmond-San Rafael Bridge</ENAMEX> .
     I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina District</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     I have felt many aftershocks .
     My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
     I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:11 a.m.</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GR8FLRED</ENAMEX> :
     I could see the flames from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> across the bay .
     It 's hard to believe this really is happening .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:11 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Building</ENAMEX> on the corner severely damaged , so an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> and her very old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> are in the guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     Books and software everywhere .
     This being typed in a standing position .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:20 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DGAULT</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bolinas</ENAMEX> -- astride the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">San Andreas Fault</ENAMEX> .
     Did n't feel a thing , but noticed some strange bird behavior .
     Duck swarms .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:25 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAMURAI</ENAMEX> :
     I just felt another aftershock <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few seconds ago</TIMEX> .
     I 'm just numb .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:25 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MACPOST</ENAMEX> :
     Downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bolinas</ENAMEX> seems to be the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> that 's worst off .
     No power , minimal phones , and a mess of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wine</ENAMEX> , and everything else all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">floors</ENAMEX> of the big old general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">People 's Co-op</ENAMEX> .
     The quivers move through my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">few minutes</TIMEX> at unpredictable intervals , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> that 's been living in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">kitchen</ENAMEX> has taken refuge under my desk .
     It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
     I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Stinson Beach</ENAMEX> when the quake rolled through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , we were unfazed .
     Then as things got rougher , we ran for the door and spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next few minutes</TIMEX> outside watching the brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">sidewalk</ENAMEX> under our feet oozing up and down , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> waving in an eerie rhythm .
     Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short-term memory .
     Everyone looked calm , but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:02 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SHIBUMI</ENAMEX> :
     Power is back on , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">UCSF</ENAMEX> -LCB- medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> -RCB- seems to have quieted down for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> -LRB- they were doing triage out in the parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lot</ENAMEX> from the sound and lights of it -RRB- .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine was in an underground computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">SF</ENAMEX> when the quake hit .
     He said that one of the computers took a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">three-foot</NUMEX> trip sliding across the floor .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> should be interesting as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> realize how hard life is going to be here for a while .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KIM</ENAMEX> :
     I got home , let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> and noticed some sounds above my head , as if someone were walking on the roof , or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">upstairs</ENAMEX> .
     Then I noticed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
     I realized what was happening and screamed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> .
     Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">kitchen</ENAMEX> walked <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a few feet</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .
     When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , waiting and praying for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merrill</ENAMEX> to come home , shivering as if it were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 below zero</NUMEX> until he got there .
     Never in my life have I been so frightened .
     When I saw the pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">880</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , I began to cry .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:09 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JROE</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">The Sunset -LCB- District </ENAMEX>-RCB- was more or less like a pajama party <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all evening</TIMEX> , lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> walking around , drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAROLG</ENAMEX> :
     I was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> started shaking like crazy .
     It 's a flimsy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">structure</ENAMEX> , built up on supports , and it was really rocking around .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of us stopped breathing for a moment , and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway .
     Needless to say , it was an interesting <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> session !
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:13 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CALLIOPE</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albany</ENAMEX> escaped embarrassingly unscathed .
     Biggest trouble was scared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> who could n't get a phone line through , and spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a really horrible hour</TIMEX> not knowing .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:01 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HLR</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> and I were in our back yard when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> started rolling like ocean waves .
     We ran into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mame</ENAMEX> , but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried to get to my feet .
     We are all fine here , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mame</ENAMEX> was extremely freaked .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Kitchen</ENAMEX> full of broken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crystal</ENAMEX> .
     Books and tapes all over my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     Not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> is where it is supposed to be , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">structure</ENAMEX> is fine .
     While I was standing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mame</ENAMEX> , waiting for another tremor , I noticed that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">earthworms</ENAMEX> were emerging from the ground and slithering across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> !
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:31 a.m.</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GR8FLRED</ENAMEX> :
     It 's amazing how <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one second</TIMEX> can so completely change your life .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FIG</ENAMEX> :
     I guess we 're all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .
     It 's hard to accept that it 's over and only took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 seconds</TIMEX> .
     I wonder when we 'll be able to relax .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:53 a.m .</TIMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PANDA</ENAMEX> :
     Flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Nausea</ENAMEX> seems a commonplace symptom .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Berkeley</ENAMEX> very quiet right now .
     I walked along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Shattuck</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Delaware</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Cedar</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes before eight this morning</TIMEX> .
     Next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chez Panisse</ENAMEX> a homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> , bundled into a blue sleeping bag , sat up , said , `` Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> '' and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> smiled , said , `` Is n't it great just to be alive ?

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> , exceeding some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' expectations , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 178 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.03</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 114 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.19</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier period</TIMEX> .
     Sales increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.65 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.41 billion</NUMEX> .
     Per-share earnings were enhanced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's share buy-back program , which reduced the average shares outstanding to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">95.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same quarter of 1988</TIMEX> .
     With strong prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major areas -- building products as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pulp</ENAMEX> and paper -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a roaring quarter</TIMEX> .
     But the performance exceeded some estimates of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 1.90</NUMEX> a share .
     Fueling the growth , among other things , were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason : efforts to protect the spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX> led to restrictions on logging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> , constricting supply and forcing prices up .
     Another reason : strikes , both at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> and other lumber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> also cut supplies and raised prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's earnings increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 504 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.58</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 338 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.41</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.73 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.94 billion</NUMEX> .
     In composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange Trading</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58</NUMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Public Works and Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> approved a bill that would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> power to block airline leveraged buy-outs , despite a clear veto threat from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> vote clears the way for consideration on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> floor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week after</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner </ENAMEX>, in a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> , warned that he would urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to veto the legislation if it passed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> already has approved similar legislation .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , a letter from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner </ENAMEX>'s deputy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Chao</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> opposed the legislation `` in its present form . ''
     Some of the bill 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> and that it did n't contain a veto threat .
     The stepped-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> warnings annoyed some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> , especially senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> who supported the bill because they thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> favored it .
     `` We backed this bill because we thought it would help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> , '' one <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> said , `` and now we 're out there dangling in the wind . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks ago</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> testified before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> that it would be `` cleaner , more efficient '' if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance .
     But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs .
     Under the committee bill , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> would have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 days</TIMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">an additional 20 days</TIMEX> if needed , to review any proposed purchase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> or more of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> 's voting stock .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest .
     Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of the bill are concerned an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market .
     `` It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberstar</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minn.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Aviation Subcommittee</ENAMEX> , said during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> 's deliberations .
     `` I do n't believe in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest '' at stake .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> disagreed , calling the legislation `` a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry . ''
     In his letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Anderson</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> also said the bill `` would be at odds with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources . ''
     Currently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance .
     However , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> concludes that a transaction has made a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> unfit to operate , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> may revoke its certificate , grounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     Such authority is more than adequate , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of the legislation .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> argue that grounding an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> is so drastic that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> would hesitate doing it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">panel</ENAMEX> rejected a proposal pushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> , to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to block corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX> from waging proxy fights to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> that oppose a leveraged buy-out .
     It also voted down proposals to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> to consider the impact of a buy-out on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears evaporated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake would depress Wall Street prices .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks , which rebounded strongly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , extended their gains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , but most other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Pacific</ENAMEX> markets closed sharply lower .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.6</NUMEX> points to close at its intraday high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2170.1</NUMEX> .
     The index was under pressure for most of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> over concerns that the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> 's major earthquake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area would undermine the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
     The mood changed after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-share index settled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.8</NUMEX> points higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1758.5</NUMEX> .
     Volume was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">449.3 million</NUMEX> shares , the slowest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a hectic week</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">643.4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> composite , or non-life , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , which some equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster , helped support the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market by showing only narrow losses in early trading .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> ' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> disaster on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> equities , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions , caused by interest-rate increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> and Wall Street 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     But technical factors , including modest gains in the value of the pound , helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier</TIMEX> .
     Among composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Accident</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 pence</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 10.03</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.80</NUMEX> -RRB- a share , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guardian Royal</ENAMEX> climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">217 pence</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Alliance</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Royal Insurance</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> .
     Life <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> fared similarly , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legal & General</ENAMEX> advancing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">344</NUMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">184 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pearl Group</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">628</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Life</ENAMEX> finished unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 10.98</NUMEX> .
     Most banking issues retreated after a sector downgrade by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warburg Securities</ENAMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Westminister</ENAMEX> showed strength on positive comments from brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> about its long-term prospects .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NatWest</ENAMEX> , the most actively traded of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX> fell in early dealings but recovered to finish at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">754</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market was nervous ahead of a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> ' meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     The session is to consider a defensive plan to spin off assets to fend off Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 13.4 billion</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T </ENAMEX>.
     The recent stock market drop has shaken confidence in the plan , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said the shares fell initially on questions about whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith </ENAMEX>'s highly leveraged bid will come to fruition .
     Trading was suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , pending an announcement that it is buying the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat Holding</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.02 billion French francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 318.7 million</NUMEX> -RRB- and expanding commercial and equity ties with advertising group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> .
     Merchant banker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> on renewed takeover speculation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S.G. Warburg</ENAMEX> , also mentioned in the rumor mill , jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> at to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">414</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">673</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> contemplated a potential battle between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> for control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's Nikkei index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> issues rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111.48</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.32 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35107.56</NUMEX> .
     The index gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">527.39</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     Volume was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800 million</NUMEX> shares , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">678 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     Declining issues outnumbered advancers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">505</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">455</NUMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> unchanged .
     The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> section , which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41.76</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01 %</NUMEX> , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2642.88</NUMEX> .
     In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , the Nikkei index rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135.09</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35242.65</NUMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Institutions</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest rates remained unclear .
     The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said , and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit , which widened by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said they did n't see any effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     The impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> and property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> with interests in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area is still being assessed , they said .
     Buying was scattered across a wide range of issues , making the session fairly characterless , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     With uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar , the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments , they said .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the popularity of issues that gained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> wo n't last long , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will rotate their buying choices over the short term .
     Interest rate-sensitive shares such as steel , construction and electric utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early in the week</TIMEX> , saw their advance weaken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said these issues need large-volume buying to push up their prices , so substantial gains are n't likely unless institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> participate .
     An outstanding issue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's session was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Rayon</ENAMEX> , which surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">905 yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.34</NUMEX> -RRB- a share .
     Its popularity was due to speculation about the strong earnings potential of a new type of plastic wrap for household use , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">County Natwest Securities Japan</ENAMEX> said .
     Some laggard food issues attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bargain-hunters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kirin Brewery</ENAMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ajinomoto</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,840</NUMEX> .
     Pharmaceuticals were mostly higher , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SS Pharmaceutical</ENAMEX> gaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,980</NUMEX> .
     Shares closed lower in other major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Pacific</ENAMEX> markets , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sydney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Taipei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> .
     Most of those markets had rebounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day before</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's slide .
     But unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> , they failed to extend the rise to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> session .
     Elsewhere , prices surged for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a second day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stockholm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and were broadly lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Milan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> gold stocks ended marginally firmer .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> , it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first trading day</TIMEX> for most major shares since stocks tumbled on Wall Street <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Trading had been impeded by a major computer failure that took place before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of Monday</TIMEX> 's session .
     Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Geneva</ENAMEX> .
     To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1969</TIMEX> equaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> .
     The percentage change is since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> .

     Housing construction sank in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> to its lowest level since the last recession , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported .
     Work began on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments</ENAMEX> at an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,263,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> decline followed an even steeper drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and left housing starts at their weakest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1982</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> was nearing the end of a recession .
     Originally the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> had reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the August</TIMEX> decline as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> .
     The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> 's battle against inflation .
     The industry had shown signs of recovery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> , after the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> began to relax its clamp on credit , allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     Sales of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> rose and inventories of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> , which had been climbing , dropped .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> new construction in all types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> waned , from single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> to large apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complexes</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's pretty much weak across the board , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Regalia</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Council of Savings Institutions</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regalia</ENAMEX> said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> will increase again .
     Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , rates on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .

     That followed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .

     Commission revenue was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 522 million</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 %</NUMEX> .

     Sales of health-care products increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , based in part on strong sales of prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Premarin</ENAMEX> , an estrogen-replacement <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> , and sales of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's infant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">formula</ENAMEX> .

     In the period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> completed the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , sold a majority interest in its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> , and announced the reorganization of its over-the-counter drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schering-Plough Health Care Products</ENAMEX> .

     It is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in reporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> disaster .

     The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Battery</ENAMEX> .
     Not mentioned were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> rendered homeless , and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200,000</NUMEX> out of work for an indeterminable period ; the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion-plus</NUMEX> in losses to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and personal property on the barrier islands ; the near - and long-term impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's largest industry , tourism , not to mention the human suffering .
     In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities , your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> .

     But even in that short time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaquin Hernandez Galicia</ENAMEX> , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">army</ENAMEX> to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina</ENAMEX> , who reigned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">28 years</TIMEX> over a graft-riddled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> that made state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Petroleos Mexicanos</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> , one of the world 's most inefficient oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Now , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> is facing accusations that he 's as much a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX> .
     In recent contract negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's role in subcontracting , long a source of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> in illicit earnings .
     And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> replacing the prickly populism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina </ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technocrats</ENAMEX> have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> 's new order has n't arrived without resistance .
     Brawls between union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> still erupt at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> installations .
     Leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuauhtemoc Cardenas</ENAMEX> publicly questioned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> , a symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> nationalism , to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">61-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> takes such criticisms in stride .
     `` This is n't a new kind of union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> , it 's a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
     We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> , which produces <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of government revenue , desperately needs new investment .
     Since world oil prices collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has siphoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's coffers to make payments on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 97 billion</NUMEX> foreign debt .
     Little money has been returned to upgrade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's aging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     While the government drains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> from above , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> has drained it from below .
     A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's operating costs to balloon to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">95 cents</NUMEX> of each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> in sales , far above the industry norm .
     The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> has been importing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gasoline</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Some projections show <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> importing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the century</TIMEX> , barring an overhaul of operations .
     `` Whatever you tried to change , whether it was cutting costs or attracting new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> , the big obstacle was the old union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> , '' says oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Baker</ENAMEX> .
     Enter Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> , who has a clear understanding of where union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> fit in the pro-enterprise regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary-general</ENAMEX> , if there is one , '' he says , greeting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> .
     Beginning as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborer</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> put in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than 40 years</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> before being pushed into retirement by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina</ENAMEX> after a dispute <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Though he also long benefited from the system built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina </ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> says union perks had simply gotten out of hand .
     They are `` at the base of all of the problems of corruption , '' he says .
     Thus , in recent contract negotiations , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> gave up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's right to assign <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> also ceded the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> commission it had received on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> maintenance contracts .
     -LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> will keep a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> commission on construction projects . -RRB-
     The new contract also eliminates the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> coupon , good only at union-owned grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , that was part of the salary of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roughneck</ENAMEX> to chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 9,800</NUMEX> technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , were switched to non-union status .
     Also , because of its reduced capital budget , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> has phased out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50,000</NUMEX> transitory construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , reducing the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 140,000</NUMEX> , the union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> increase in compensation .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are the ones most thrilled by the contract .
     `` We are retaking the instruments of administration , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul Robles </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subdirector</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would n't say how much money the new contract would save the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> previous government estimate pegged savings at around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> a year .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> also are pleased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's new spirit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grupo Desc</ENAMEX> , a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , has long depended on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> to produce plastic packing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">material</ENAMEX> .
     But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> shut down for an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> overhaul , it would never give notice to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> .
     `` The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Vega Velasco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Desc</ENAMEX> 's finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Desc</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> were consulted well in advance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience .
     Taming the union complements previous moves by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to attract private investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> has been forced to import in large quantities in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> , long limited to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> stake in secondary petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , to own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 100 %</NUMEX> .
     Later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> reclassified several basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> as secondary products .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's courtship with private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , and especially foreign ones , is controversial in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1938</TIMEX> .
     `` They are preparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for what 's coming : foreign control , '' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heberto Castillo</ENAMEX> , a leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products .
     But the new union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> makes no apologies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> 's more outward-looking attitude .
     `` If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence , sooner or later we 're going to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of our own isolation , '' he says .

     Couple Counseling Grows to Defuse Stress
     MORE <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">EXECUTIVES</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> initiate referrals , especially if work problems threaten a top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> 's job .

     More dual-career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> also are getting help , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> increasingly bringing their working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> for joint counseling .
     `` The level of stress for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is often so high , it 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> who says , ` I 'm worried about her , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz</ENAMEX> .

     Merger Fallout : Beware Employee Dishonesty
     CORPORATE security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security</ENAMEX> magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> biggest challenges .
     `` If it causes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to take their eye off the ball , inventory shrinkage is going to be affected , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Shealy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for loss prevention at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field 's</ENAMEX> , the department store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> .
     A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Co-author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Hollinger</ENAMEX> cites what happened at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> absorbed by a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> .
     Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> `` felt abandoned by the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> .
     But top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds , like expense-account fudging and phone misuse .
     Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Dalton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ventura</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , thinks mergers often trigger <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer lunch hours</TIMEX> and increased absenteeism , conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts .
     New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can take several steps to reduce dishonesty .
     Most important , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say , is to show that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's ethical tone is set at the top .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalton</ENAMEX> also recommends that the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> establish a rumor control center and move swiftly to bolster morale .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly seven</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> reinvest `` too little '' of their profits in the business .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens </ENAMEX>'s remarks , confirming a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> , helped push <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock lower for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the fourth straight day</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.25</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.75</NUMEX> on volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3 million</NUMEX> shares in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> as concern deepened among takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase .
     Under the original buy-out approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 14</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> planned to put up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> in cash and make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> cost concessions for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> stake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> was to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> was to receive a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stake .
     The buy-out fell through when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .
     Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock has fallen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
     The tenor of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> 's remarks seemed to indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> will take a more active , high-profile role in pursuing any new bid .
     He said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX> , and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .
     `` As far as we 're concerned , we 're waiting for the dust to settle , '' he said .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> is waiting to see what the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> comes up with , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     He said the original proposal is dead , and all aspects of a revised version are up for change , in light of the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's market price , the amount of debt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> are willing to fund , and the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> would be willing to pay .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said he expects the new price will be considerably lower , but declined to specify a figure .
     Asked whether a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 230</NUMEX>-a-share figure circulating in the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> is too low , he said , `` It 's certainly not too low . ''
     He added the original offer was `` a pretty full price , '' and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> 's contribution `` was quite a large chunk for us . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , but was n't particularly happy with paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> .
     `` If the -LCB- new -RCB- deal had us putting up less money but still having <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> , that would be a point in our favor , '' he said .
     In any new proposal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Air</ENAMEX> would expect a greater rate of return than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%-plus</NUMEX> in the original proposal .
     In the event that the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> stalls in reviving its bid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction , even without any legal obligation to do so .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly one-third</NUMEX> of its stock is believed held by takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , who could vote to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> if they become impatient .
     Meanwhile , the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's task of holding its fragile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">coalition</ENAMEX> together , in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> itself .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> representing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> hired during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> strike filed suit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> to block the takeover .
     The dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> agreed to reduce the seniority of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> in exchange for the support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> for the buy-out proposal .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> involved in the suit are n't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> had allowed them to move ahead of some union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in seniority following the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> strike , a move the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> had contested in a previous lawsuit .

     Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases , according to a study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> have embraced the `` utilization management '' cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     These programs vary widely , but often require <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Between 50 % and 75 %</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are covered by such plans , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> .
     `` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">purchasers</ENAMEX> , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">affiliate</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX> , concluded after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> study .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Employers</ENAMEX> who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . ''
     While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> of health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> .
     The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow .
     `` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> said .
     `` As a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">sites</ENAMEX> of care . ''
     The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Bailit</ENAMEX> , a panel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna Life & Casualty</ENAMEX> , said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> .
     `` There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization , '' he said .
     But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed .
     `` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bailit</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Rahill</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A. Foster Higgins & Co.</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> of his consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Grossman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high .
     `` You have a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grossman </ENAMEX>, who also is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOSPITAL">New England Medical Center Hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> he runs deal with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> utilization management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review .
     `` Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">providers</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> concluded .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DAF Trucks NV</ENAMEX> announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Gras</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , said the new line will cover <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons</NUMEX> and will be built at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Bapilly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DAF</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> state-controlled auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> plan to incorporate the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> into their product lines when they begin production toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the middle of the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gras</ENAMEX> said he expects a definitive agreement between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to be completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few months</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> ahead of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DAF</ENAMEX> are expected to invest a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about three billion French francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 157.8 million</NUMEX> -RRB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FFr 1 billion</NUMEX> for design and development costs .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will each spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about FFr 1 billion</NUMEX> on tooling up their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gras</ENAMEX> said the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> represents considerable savings for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DAF</ENAMEX> , since both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> .
     By pooling their resources , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> market for light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">2.5-ton</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">4.2-ton</NUMEX> range is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 700,000 and 800,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DAF</ENAMEX> are aiming for a combined market share of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 11 %</NUMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DAF</ENAMEX> will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vans</ENAMEX> and light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> .
     Under a separate arrangement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rover Group PLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> will also be able to offer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault</ENAMEX> 's truck-building subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Renault Vehicles Industriels</ENAMEX> will have similar rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX> is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes , for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons .
     First , its position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> is anomalous .
     It has an unusual kind of independence from elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and still has authority over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most powerful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's instruments -- the control of the money supply .
     Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , the responsibilities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">guardian</ENAMEX> of the currency , which means as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">guardian</ENAMEX> of the stability of the price level , sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular .
     As former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William McChesney Martin</ENAMEX> used to say , they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> is an attractive target for complaint by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness , like high interest rates or slow economic growth , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> can escape responsibility by pointing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's independence .
     This leads to proposals for `` reform '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> , which have the common feature of making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> more responsive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and to public opinion -- without , however , any assumption of additional responsibility by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> .
     These proposals include changing the term of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , shortening the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> , eliminating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Banks</ENAMEX> from the decision-making process , putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> , having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> audited by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">arm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> -LRB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> -RRB- , putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's expenditures in the budget , and requiring prompt publication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's minutes .
     Some of these ideas are again under consideration in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's problem is or , if they do , they rest on an incorrect view .
     They would not solve the problem ; they would make it worse .
     The problem is not that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> is too unresponsive to the public interest .
     On the contrary , it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest .
     The price level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4 1\/4</NUMEX> times as high as it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> .
     On average , something that cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> now costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 425</NUMEX> .
     Or , a wage that was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> would buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 23.53</NUMEX> worth of stuff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> occasions the inflation rate rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> .
     In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> worst of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the postwar period</TIMEX> .
     The enormous inflation over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 30 years</TIMEX> was largely due to monetary policy .
     At least , it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increase in the money supply during the same period .
     And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> .
     The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience .
     There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 30 years</TIMEX> :
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . To some extent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Even where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it .
     Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
     The common proposals for reforming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> would only make the situation worse , if they had any effect at all .
     Putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Governors</ENAMEX> , one of the leading proposals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , is an example .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> is the world 's biggest borrower of money .
     He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates .
     Moreover , he is a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election , and less to its longer-run health .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">These days</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> suffers the further disqualification that he is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">club</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be , which is a diversion from the real business of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to stabilize the price level .
     How should a reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> interpret a congressional decision to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> ?
     Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level ?
     Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> represents -- low interest rates , short-run economic expansion , and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels ?
     The answer seems perfectly clear .
     -LRB- True , a succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairmen</ENAMEX> has given color to the notion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> belongs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> .
     By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairmen</ENAMEX> have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">stew</ENAMEX> , in which case it is natural that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , and probably also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .
     The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> exercises a power given to it by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
     What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy , which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level .
     To leave this decision to an `` independent '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> is not only undemocratic .
     It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale , because it leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> guessing about what are the expectations of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> , who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy .
     The greatest contribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> could make at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this time</TIMEX> would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve System </ENAMEX>.
     Legislation to this effect has been introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in this session by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Neal </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted , however .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> would be required to make a hard decision , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> and retain its rights of complaint after the fact .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> will say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> have other objectives , in addition to stabilizing the price level , which is true .
     But that is not the same as saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> has other objectives .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> and instruments for pursuing these other objectives .
     But it has only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to pursue price-level stability .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> for the attention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> are high employment and rapid real growth .
     But the main lesson of economic policy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 30 years</TIMEX> is that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals , the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation .

     Abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> won <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's battles , but the war over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions .
     Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> , with easy approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Casey</ENAMEX> expected shortly thereafter .
     Legislation to require the consent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> before their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> under the age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18</TIMEX> can have abortions will probably pass both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Blanchard</ENAMEX> .
     The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors that are likely to govern the debate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next several months</TIMEX> : the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of lassitude , and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> arena with a victory of its own elsewhere .
     The action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , for example , will follow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's collapse of a special session of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> to enact restrictions on abortions in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , and the vote here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> to permit federally paid abortions for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of rape or incest .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that , along with the easy approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> measure , is likely to mute the abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement .
     `` It 's great to feel good for once in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Hickman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> , reflecting the relief of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compatriots</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's victories , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major events since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> , in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 3</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> decision , permitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to enact restrictions on abortions .
     `` But how many more times we 're going to feel good in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next 15</TIMEX> is another question . ''
     Indeed , abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> still face their greatest tests .
     `` The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen Halva-Neubauer</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Furman University</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> who specializes in how state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> handle the abortion question .
     `` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> of abortion hold the strong whip hand in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , where abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> does n't reflect the viewpoints of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Freind</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Delaware County</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">legislature</ENAMEX> 's leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> directly to reassess its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe v. Wade</ENAMEX> decision that established the right of abortion in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freind</ENAMEX> legislation -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> approved it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Harrisburg</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> and the full <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> is expected to take up the bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> -- includes a provision to ban abortions after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">24 weeks</TIMEX> of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freind</ENAMEX> calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe</ENAMEX> established , will `` make it necessary '' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to review <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe</ENAMEX> and , perhaps , to overturn it .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> measure also includes an `` informed consent '' provision that may become widely imitated by abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> who want to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves .
     Under this legislation , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> must be informed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks .
     `` Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freind</ENAMEX> argues , `` it is virtually impossible for any rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> to disagree with the concept that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> way or the other , might remain with her for the rest of her life . ''
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , where the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of next week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blanchard</ENAMEX> is the principal obstacle for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-abortionists</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Rogin</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , takes comfort from the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> `` have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">16 years</TIMEX> . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ' rights .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> will vote before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> on legislation requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to perform tests on fetuses at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">20 weeks</TIMEX> to determine their gestational age , weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that , if fetuses survive an abortion , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> must be on hand to help it survive .
     The legislation failed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> vote to clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Rules Committee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-abortionists</ENAMEX> still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela Sutherland</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Illinois Planned Parenthood Council</ENAMEX> , says she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> are `` cautiously optimistic '' they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote .
     Abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wisconsin </ENAMEX>, meanwhile , expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early November</TIMEX> and are hopeful of prevailing in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">houses</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next March</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds , personnel and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> for abortion , and viability tests for fetuses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">19 weeks</TIMEX> and older .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-abortionists</ENAMEX> are urging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clements</ENAMEX> to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 14 to Dec. 13</TIMEX> .
     `` The prognosis is only fair , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Roberts</ENAMEX> , administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Texas Right to Life Committee</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next year</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an election year</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> just do n't want to do anything about this now . ''
     This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts , plunging into gubernatorial races in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , and girding for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next autumn</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> elections .
     At the same time , abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> have developed a national legislative strategy , deciding to move on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacki Ragan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Right to Life Committee</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of state organizational development , calls `` reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> support . ''
     These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection , and the public funding of alternatives for abortion .
     `` Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves ` pro-choice ' rather than ` pro-abortion , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Spaulding</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's associate state legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Abortion Rights Action League</ENAMEX> singled out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freind</ENAMEX> , as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> targets and held a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> seminar designed to train its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in political techniques , including how to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-abortionists</ENAMEX> on the defensive in state legislatures .
