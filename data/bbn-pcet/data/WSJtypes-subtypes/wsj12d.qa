     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's Corp.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> on a hefty sales gain , but domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> apparently did n't partake of the improvement .
     The world 's largest fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> said net income rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 217.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">59 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">51 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     In the latest period , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">370.8 million</NUMEX> shares , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6 million</NUMEX> shares below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's level .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.63 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.46 billion</NUMEX> .
     Systemwide sales , which include sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisee</ENAMEX> as well as company-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.59 billion</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     But sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> were flat at best on a per-store basis despite weak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> figures .
     Compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of last year</TIMEX> , average franchisee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> were down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 3,200</NUMEX> , reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> .
     Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> menu prices rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , the actual decline may have been more .

     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> were having a tough time holding sales , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> company-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> posted hefty gains for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , with sales per company-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> rising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> often has better store locations than do its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> , thus aiding promotional efforts .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> said that systemwide sales would have been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 115 million</NUMEX> greater had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> exchange rates remained in effect .
     `` Going into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> the sales comparison will be more difficult , '' predicted restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Hansen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co .</ENAMEX>

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     `` There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P. Uphoff</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Raymond James Associates Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` I did n't even know that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in a socialistic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> could file for bankruptcy . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> said the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Fantasy</ENAMEX> , '' the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> has on order , is scheduled to be delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> , just in time for the winter tourist season in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Caribbean</ENAMEX> .
     That <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> , which would carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,050</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> , would expand the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> 's existing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-ship <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> , which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-completed , is scheduled to be delivered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fall 1990</TIMEX> , and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fall 1991</TIMEX> .
     `` There 's a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 %</NUMEX> chance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Fantasy</ENAMEX> will be delivered close to schedule , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caroline Levy</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> .
     `` The others will probably be delivered as well , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> will likely have to pay a higher price for them . ''
     She said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> could pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 25 %</NUMEX> more for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's earnings as soon as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990 fiscal year</TIMEX> , which begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 1</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said those estimates -- which range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.80</NUMEX> a share to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.95</NUMEX> a share -- are based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Fantasy</ENAMEX> being in operation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> fails to arrive , those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents</NUMEX> or more .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> were n't willing to speculate on how much money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> might lose through deposits .
     Normally , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> pays a portion of the total cost of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> as it reaches various stages of construction .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> , for example , has already paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 160 million</NUMEX> of the total cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Fantasy</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say this may give it the right to seize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ship</ENAMEX> if the situation warrants it .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton Corp.</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     Sales of medium and heavy-duty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> continue to lag <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">previous-year</TIMEX> rates , leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> to expect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> net income to fall below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> levels , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen R. Hardis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial and administrative officer</ENAMEX> .
     He declined to make a specific earnings estimate .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.04</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.47</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 864.1 million</NUMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 840.4 million</NUMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">summer</TIMEX> doldrums as they usually do , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick E. Sheridan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald & Co</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheridan </ENAMEX>, who had been expecting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.25</NUMEX> a share , says he is reducing his estimate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> to the area of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.70</NUMEX> a share , from his previous estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.10</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eli Lustgarten</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> reduced his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> estimate to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.70</NUMEX> a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5.50</NUMEX> a share in light of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> report .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">quarter</TIMEX> profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 295 million</NUMEX> .
     Sales of parts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> rose .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 51 million</NUMEX> on an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</NUMEX> drop in sales to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 488 million</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardis</ENAMEX> said truck-fleet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> appear to be cautious about buying new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> until they see how the economy behaves .
     The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral .
     Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> 's other major business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32 million</NUMEX> , despite a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 %</NUMEX> increase in sales to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 376 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> appliance-controls market .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , net -- including profit from discontinued operations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">both years</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> an extraordinary charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.7 million</NUMEX> related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.54</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 161.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.32</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> earned from continuing operations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 165.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.40</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 177.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.76</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nine-month</TIMEX> sales were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.79 billion</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.2 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.58 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eaton</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57.50</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.50</NUMEX> .

     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracies</ENAMEX> , and democratize local politics .
     Initial steps were taken at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> international environmental conference , which I attended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     The conference , held in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Lower Silesia</ENAMEX> , was co-sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Environment Ministry</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Rockefeller Brothers Fund</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Ecological Club</ENAMEX> , and was attended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and industry , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Czechs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> .
     The conference was entitled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection</ENAMEX> , '' a significant departure from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> usage , which recognizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior .
     Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's lack of functioning markets .
     Why did <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">participants</ENAMEX> unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ?
     The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> and the perceived causes of that degradation .
     Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
     According to a detailed report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zbigniew Bochniarz</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Minnesota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Hubert Humphrey Institute</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> areas containing a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards .
     Norms are consistently exceeded at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of nitrogen oxide monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">sites</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of those for dust and soot emissions .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four-fifths</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's soils have become highly acidified ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> of its southern forests are projected to die by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">century 's end</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Between 1965 and 1985</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">waters</ENAMEX> fit for human consumption dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 % to 6 %</NUMEX> of all surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waters</ENAMEX> , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> times more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soot</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waste</ENAMEX> per unit of gross national product than does <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Its mortality rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">35</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> higher in hazard areas than the national average .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> , average annual growth rates for most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">pollutants</ENAMEX> have outstripped the growth of GNP .
     Conference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Marxist</ENAMEX> devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprises</ENAMEX> are state-owned and penalties are paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Stalinist</ENAMEX> emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
     They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> makes the wrong decisions .
     The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
     But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">state</ENAMEX> , making it fully accountable for pollution control .
     A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
     Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> at the conference : `` The world must be coming to an end .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> are talking peace .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> are talking elections .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> are engaged in commerce . ''
     But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">republics</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     Those implications include : -- Privatization .
     Faced with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion</NUMEX> foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance .
     Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries .
     But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">monopolies</ENAMEX> , giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects . -- Least-cost solutions .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     That means simple , clear rules that secure the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk .
     It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees .
     That 's because quota-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals . -- Creative financing .
     Even least-cost environmental solutions will require <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> .
     New types of financing must make funds available without draining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's hard-currency reserves . -- Democratization .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> pollution data typically have been state secrets .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> data have been freely available since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , it was no accident that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> urged the free flow of information .
     For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose . -- Global reciprocity .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> prematurely declared that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> represents the opposite .
     His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to cling to command-and-control measures if even the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> steps to a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drummer</ENAMEX> .
     At the moment , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> resembles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness .
     But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin </ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> 's regulatory reform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , adapted this from his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> column for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association</ENAMEX> .

     Disappointing earnings news from some technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> unnerved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> and many other computer-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> .
     The drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> slide by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite index .
     It finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">467.22</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.45</NUMEX> .
     The nervousness about the technology stock outlook also hurt the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</NUMEX> .
     Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC 's largest non-financial issues dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.58</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">457.52</NUMEX> .
     The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking issues lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.38</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">458.32</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Howley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in charge of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SoundView Financial</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , said the selling was orderly .
     `` It 's a quiet retreat , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howley</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's nothing dramatic , just a routine sell-off . ''
     Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , he said .
     But some of it also represented profit-taking by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who have made big gains in some issues .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117.2 million</NUMEX> shares was far below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's sizzling average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 177 million</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> so far , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume is averaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150.3 million</NUMEX> , putting it on track to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 's busiest month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> , which reported lackluster earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 3\/4</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1 million</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stratus Computer</ENAMEX> , which reported earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> that were in line with a disappointing forecast , eased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">816,000</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> apparently did n't like the news from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rainbow Technologies</ENAMEX> either .
     It said net income was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents</NUMEX> a share in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 cents</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rainbow</ENAMEX> 's stock dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 1\/4</NUMEX> .
     Other technology stocks that were weaker included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 1\/2</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9 million</NUMEX> shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mentor Graphics </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 1\/4</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6 million</NUMEX> shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems </ENAMEX>, which slipped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 1\/4</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications </ENAMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 3\/4</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> , which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> rose to a record , fell victim to profit-taking , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said , as it declined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83 1\/8</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conner Peripherals</ENAMEX> was unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> .
     Among takeover stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferson Smurfit</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 1\/2</NUMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SIBV-MS Holdings</ENAMEX> said the price to be paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferson Smurfit</ENAMEX> 's minority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">holders</ENAMEX> has been raised to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43</NUMEX> a share .
     The increase of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> a share is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SIBV-MS</ENAMEX> 's tender offer .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SIBV-MS Holdings</ENAMEX> is a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> jointly owned by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferson Smurfit</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> limited partnership .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferson Smurfit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smurfit International B.V.</ENAMEX> , holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 78 %</NUMEX> of the shares outstanding .
     These shares will be bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SIBV-MS Holdings</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 41.75</NUMEX> each after the acquisition of the minority shares .
     Another takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> , eased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110 1\/8</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313,800</NUMEX> shares .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw Cellular Communications </ENAMEX>, dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 350,000</NUMEX> shares .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointments .
     They say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will favor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that historically have posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> earnings growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> .
     That would be good news for the OTC market , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , because many small growth stocks are traded there .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael R. Weisberg </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in charge of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Robertson Stephens & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , said some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have already made the switch .
     The Robertson Stephens Index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> emerging growth stocks is up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.1 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The rise matches that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .

     Why ca n't we teach our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to read , write and reckon ?
     It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do .
     It 's that we do n't want to .
     And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .
     These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> , and even our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
     Here is an example .
     If I were to ask a sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> , `` Do you wish the elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> to encourage creativity in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course . ''
     But what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity '' ?
     No one can say .
     In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> ' `` self-esteem . ''
     The result is a generation of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
     The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was -LRB- and is -RRB- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was -LRB- and is -RRB- regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     It is not surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
     Fortunately , these same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do want their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
     Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share .
     The education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">establishment</ENAMEX> will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
     The reasons are complex , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
     `` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> than is disciplined instruction .
     It is nice for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
     It also provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
     I myself took such courses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> , thinking I might end up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX> .
     They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses .
     But it is unfair to dump on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> , as distinct from the educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">establishment</ENAMEX> .
     I know many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteachers</ENAMEX> and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
     They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , by definition .
     But they need not be to do their jobs well .
     Yes , we all can remember <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> truly inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">our school days</TIMEX> .
     But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
     In this sense , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> can be compared to one 's family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> .
     If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place .
     If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well .
     Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
     Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
     It is silly libel on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to think they would educate our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> better if only they got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year more .
     It is the kind of libel the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
     It is also the kind of libel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> .
     But there is not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials .
     If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
     If we wish to be serious about <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
     There are many successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> scattered throughout this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
     Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
     We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .
     In this respect , it would be helpful if our political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned . ''
     They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
     Thus at the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> ' conference on education , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> announced that `` this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> needs a comprehensive child-development policy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under five</TIMEX> . ''
     A comprehensive development policy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">over 30</TIMEX> would seem to be a more pressing need .
     What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">the pre-kindergarten years</TIMEX> .
     Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
     We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
     Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> are too likely to blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> for the educational limitations of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> should be involved with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's education at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     They should see to it that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do n't play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">truant</ENAMEX> ; they should make certain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are dissatisfied with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , they should have the option of switching to another . -- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea .
     Here , the experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> is decisive .
     Locally elected school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">boards</ENAMEX> , especially in our larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> or would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> is in the process of trying to
     disengage itself from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">20-year-old</TIMEX> commitment to this system of school governance , even as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> are moving to institute it .
     -- In most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
     The reason is simple : Education takes place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> , where the influence of money is minimal .
     Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> effect on the academic performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons .
     The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> .
     There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures -LRB- in real terms -RRB- have increased sharply in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past quarter-of-a-century</TIMEX> -- we now spend more per pupil than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> in the world -- educational performance has declined .
     That is the way the system works .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows .
     No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> should be permitted to be graduated from elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> without having mastered the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R 's at the level that prevailed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX> .
     This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> to flourish -LRB- though that is clearly desirable -RRB- than to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">less gifted</ENAMEX> get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work .
     The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd .
     The purpose of education is to encourage young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to realize their full academic potential .
     No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
     -- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than newer ones .
     The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
     They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> do so poorly in math tests , as compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> textbooks and teaching methods .
     Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caleb Nelson</ENAMEX> -LRB- himself a recent math major at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> -RRB- in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX> . -- Most important of all , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> should have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> with a large measure of authority over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
     Study after study -- the most recent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Brookings Institution</ENAMEX> -- tells us that the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> .
     With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">Schools</ENAMEX> that are structured in this way produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with higher morale and superior academic performance .
     This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> face when computerizing their operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> unveiled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning .
     The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> have already spent so heavily on automation that they are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the computer industry 's leading revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sources</ENAMEX> .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> has long dominated and where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> has recently gained market share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consultants</ENAMEX> have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> unveiled will generally be available by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the first quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Albert</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scarsdale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , said that in the past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines .
     He said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ' problems and was n't just selling technology .
     He said he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> to unveil similar strategies for other industries in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming months</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing .
     Rather than just send out marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to knock on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ' doors , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> of its own manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> available to discuss specific needs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> also will be able to provide software that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has developed internally and will be able to form <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> to jointly solve manufacturing problems .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but it could also help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents .
     `` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Conrades</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's top marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .

     The tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act .
     Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> reduced their assets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.4 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans .
     Industry assets as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 31</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.31 trillion</NUMEX> , the lowest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August 1988</TIMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
     As interest rates paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depositors</ENAMEX> were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.1 billion</NUMEX> , not including interest credited to accounts .
     It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third consecutive month</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> said .
     The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .

     For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX> insolvent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> under government management at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of August</TIMEX> , assets declined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.3 billion</NUMEX> and withdrawals exceeded deposits by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Thrifts</ENAMEX> raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.8 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the prior month</TIMEX> .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 31</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> held <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 185 billion</NUMEX> in mortgage-backed securities .
     The deposit numbers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> marked a swing back to huge outflows after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> net deposit inflow of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million</NUMEX> -- the only net inflow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a year</TIMEX> .
     Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
     `` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in rates , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ely</ENAMEX> said .

     The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bureau of Economic Analysis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Commerce</ENAMEX> significantly understate the rate of economic growth .
     Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureau</ENAMEX> 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Labor </ENAMEX>, underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics .
     If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
     It would also affect the perceptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve System </ENAMEX>, and the informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> .
     This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes , the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> .
     There has indeed been more than a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point improvement in productivity growth since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     But I had expected more , which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason I began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates .
     The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1948-89</TIMEX> period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
     -LRB- It is , however , possible , that further study will reveal increasing bias . -RRB-
     This bias is in no way deliberate .
     The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> , paid household services and private non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institutions</ENAMEX> , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
     This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .
     In an unrelated program in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> does estimate output per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two-thirds</NUMEX> of federal civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , it found an average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of productivity improvement of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     Even if it is assumed that productivity rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than half</NUMEX> as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 percentage point</NUMEX> a year , on average .
     The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of private financial and service industries as well .
     Independent estimates of output in those industries , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Labor</ENAMEX> for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 1.5 %</NUMEX> a year <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1948 and 1988</TIMEX> .
     Because finance and services contribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.15 %</NUMEX> a year .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes .
     I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin N. Baily</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Gordon</ENAMEX> add a further <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12 percentage point</NUMEX> to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
     Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
     Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 0.26</NUMEX> percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate .
     In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 percentage point</NUMEX> understatement in growth of total real GNP .
     For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> percentage point .
     In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> .

     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .

     In the industrial-gases segment , operating profit climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58 million</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">The latest quarter</TIMEX> included a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 62 million</NUMEX> on the sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Propylene glycols</ENAMEX> are used in making personal-care products such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">shampoo</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">urethane polyols</ENAMEX> are used in making the polyurethane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">foam</ENAMEX> found in furniture cushioning and other products .
     That gain was mostly offset by a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 55 million</NUMEX> from a write-down in its polysilicon business .

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> are resisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's license to sell securities within their borders .
     The reluctance of some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> off the hook could hamper the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> felonies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , say several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> familiar with the discussions .
     Up to now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">commonwealth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> announced it made a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75,000</NUMEX> settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have been entering into settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> despite its record as an admitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">felon</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the generally successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> talks say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is meeting resistance from some big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> in some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
     They question if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has to settle with state securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> that includes payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 650 million</NUMEX> in penalties .
     These stem from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">District of Columbia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> have been less resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> than the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> would n't be directly hurt .
     It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> ; securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking .
     Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> could be involved .
     Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> praise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul S. Cohen</ENAMEX> , to settle its legal problems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> .
     `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Bryant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> 's chief securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">North American Securities Administrators Association </ENAMEX>, which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
     The question , she said , is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . ''
     While Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> went ahead and accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's settlement offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25,000</NUMEX> , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .
     I can see both sides . ''
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Rubega</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of securities regulation , said his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> had n't received any complaints about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> , so it really could n't press the issue .
     Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> are holding out , he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the day</TIMEX> ' we 'll be losing any licenses . ''
     Asked about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 million</NUMEX> has been paid to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> still expects to pay out a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.5 million</NUMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> should have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another three to four</NUMEX> settlements , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said .
     `` The rate we 're going , I think that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> , we 're looking to have a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 to 35</NUMEX> , '' he said .
     That total would be important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
     The investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">foundation</ENAMEX> to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry .
     A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> reach settlement agreements before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     There are , according to several securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> that are either close to settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's proposed state fines have been based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and on the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , for example , was asked to accept <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300,000</NUMEX> , but refused .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> is n't ruling out revoking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's brokerage license .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> can also bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> as an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> .
     State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> wo n't describe their position in detail , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James McLelland Smith</ENAMEX> , state securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> -RRB- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's brokerage license .
     It is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> that have met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and asked for additional information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' accounts and other matters .
     `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Brown</ENAMEX> said .
     A banking department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> added : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . ''
     Particularly touchy are the cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">base</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">base</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's highly profitable junk-bond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> that led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's legal difficulties .
     Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has settled , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> if its license is revoked , according to state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the state securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has done a better job of settling with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">E.F. Hutton</ENAMEX> did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> .
     Still , she said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's trouble with some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> is n't a bad thing .
     `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> said .
