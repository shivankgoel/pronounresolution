     The list of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratories</ENAMEX> claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing .
     But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms .
     New experiments at some of the big national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratories</ENAMEX> are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">tritium</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> experiment to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Utah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
     The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> reports delivered at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fall</TIMEX> meeting here of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Electrochemical Society</ENAMEX> , the first scientific meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five months</TIMEX> to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments .
     The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research .
     Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> registered for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">society</ENAMEX> 's weeklong meeting , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 200</NUMEX> sat through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day and a half</TIMEX> of cold fusion presentations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">week 's end</TIMEX> .
     This was in contrast with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">society</ENAMEX> 's meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last May</TIMEX> , at the height of the controversy , when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> , along with scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> , crowded into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballroom</ENAMEX> for a tumultuous special <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> session on the subject .
     Neither of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Stanley Pons</ENAMEX> , were at the meeting .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of an ad hoc expert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> set up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Energy</ENAMEX> to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> is to recommend at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">DOE</ENAMEX> should support cold fusion research .
     Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> experiments described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last March</TIMEX> by Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> .
     The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> and plunging the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> electrodes into `` heavy '' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">deuterium</ENAMEX> .
     When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> did begin to break up , or dissociate .
     Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
     But Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
     The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in , they reported .
     Because they also detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">tritium</ENAMEX> and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">labs</ENAMEX> also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> reports presented here of excess heat production was given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Oriani</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of chemical engineering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Minnesota</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriani</ENAMEX> said his skepticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> claims was initially confirmed when his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> failed to produce results .
     But he then borrowed a palladium rod from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Texas A&M</ENAMEX> who said they were getting excess heat .
     `` The results were fascinating , '' he said .
     On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat .
     The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
     When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> before dying down , he said .
     Typical of other experiments , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriani</ENAMEX> said his experiment was `` very erratic . ''
     It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 11 hours</TIMEX> before quieting down .
     The excess heat was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriani</ENAMEX> said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have suggested .
     `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> at a time .
     The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
     Typically , the input energy ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">a third of a watt</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">one watt</NUMEX> and the excess energy is measured in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">tenths of a watt</NUMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> exception is a continuing experiment at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford University</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">as much as 10 watts</NUMEX> of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells .
     A cell filled with heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> is producing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:ENERGY">1.0 to 1.5 watts</NUMEX> more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> next to it , reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turgut M. Gur</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> of materials <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Huggins</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford</ENAMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bockris</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Texas A&M University</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bockris</ENAMEX> previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">tritium</ENAMEX> forming in the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> .
     He said that within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few days</TIMEX> , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">tritium</ENAMEX> .
     There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">tritium</ENAMEX> in the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">tritium</ENAMEX> formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
     Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons , which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions , continue to be negative .
     Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Sandia National Laboratories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX> , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> neutron detectors into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">tunnel</ENAMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">300 feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">granite</ENAMEX> to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
     A number of times they detected neutrons in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> detectors , but only once during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">411 hours</TIMEX> of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimson Gottesfeld</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Los Alamos National Laboratory</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last April</TIMEX> but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
     In subsequent experiments , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
     They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , new experiments indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">lithium</ENAMEX> added to the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pons</ENAMEX> might have misinterpreted , reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Ross</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">laboratory</ENAMEX> .

     Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> and sales dropped slightly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Net fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">67 cents</NUMEX> a common share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93.7 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.03</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     Sales fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.54 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.58 billion</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , the electronics and defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> had net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 255.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.70</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 271 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.01</NUMEX> a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .
     Sales were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.66 billion</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.6 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Junkins</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
     That , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
     In addition , cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> charge to reduce the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> ' defense-electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> also reduced net .

     `` We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market , '' he said , `` and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand . ''
     Further , he said , an internal reorganization to combine several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Information Technology Group</ENAMEX> is expected to affect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> results by an undisclosed amount .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> 's attempted corner on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX> is still haunting the market in this metal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Silver</ENAMEX> , now trading <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 5</NUMEX> an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50</NUMEX> an ounce in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1980</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 9</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-1979</TIMEX> .
     `` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's attempt to squeeze the silver market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> is still indirectly to blame for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's market depression , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesley Edgar</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sharps Pixley Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> bullion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     While <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">some 100 million ounces</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> once held by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1979-80</TIMEX> precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to economize on silver use , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar</ENAMEX> says .
     Photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> , for example , bought equipment to recover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> from spent photographs , negatives and processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">solutions</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Silver</ENAMEX> 's history of volatility is also discouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say .
     Even in the present uncertain investment climate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are preferring `` quality assets '' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills and bonds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say .
     Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> to curb inflation , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Silver</ENAMEX> , however is in a deeper slump than are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">platinum</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> .
     `` Bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick R. Demler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
     A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , he says .
     Scrap <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> are converting smaller quantities of metal into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> , while low prices are discouraging exports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Peru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> says .
     Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> has risen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six years</TIMEX> in a row , he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> demand grew by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of this year</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">4.5 million ounces</NUMEX> .
     Compared with huge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> surpluses of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">more than 100 million ounces</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the 1980s</TIMEX> , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> says .
     Despite intermittent rallies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> , improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> prices into a higher range .
     `` There 's just too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> around , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Butler</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Samuel Montagu & Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> bullion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> .
     A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">warehouses</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">at least 617 million ounces</NUMEX> is the market depressant , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> in a report .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year alone</TIMEX> , inventories at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commodity Exchange of New York</ENAMEX> jumped `` by a staggering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">221 million ounces</NUMEX> '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fabricators</ENAMEX> and sales by disenchanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhona O'Connell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX>-based precious metals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
     `` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connell</ENAMEX> says .
     Moreover , while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> hoard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and help underpin its price , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> does n't have the same mystique , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> have gotten burned on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">silver</ENAMEX> so often that they are far more partial to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urs Seiler</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland</ENAMEX> .
     Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> caution that any increase would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 to $ 2</NUMEX> at most .
     Looking ahead to other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Livestock</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Meats</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> in the wake of a government <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> census that found fewer-than-expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> on feedlots .
     After the close of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> reported that feedlots in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> biggest ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">states</ENAMEX> held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.06 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that date a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to report a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> decline .
     Feedlots fatten young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beef</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> reported that the number of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> placed on feedlots during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier quarter</TIMEX> .
     Many industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had been projecting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> decline in placements for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 quarter</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> were forced to sell their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> to feedlot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> because the drought dried out the pasture on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ranches</ENAMEX> .
     The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> moving onto feedlots in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the recent quarter</TIMEX> was also lower because fattening <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> is less profitable .
     A shortage of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> has made them more expensive for feedlot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> to buy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> also said that the number of fattened <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> slaughtered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 quarter</TIMEX> , which was in line with projections by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     Energy
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44-cent</NUMEX>-a-barrel price drop to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.98</NUMEX> in the expiring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> may well set the tone for trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> in petroleum futures on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
     Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
     Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days</TIMEX> ahead should further test recent projections by oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and other market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> that strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> demand will keep prices firm .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Copper</ENAMEX>
     Copper prices fell sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery settled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5 cents</NUMEX> lower at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2345</NUMEX> a pound .
     Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> long-term strikes .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said , rank-and-file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ratified a new labor agreement ending a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> added , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cananea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> , who have been out of work since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late August</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> was declared bankrupt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , accepted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> cut in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,800</NUMEX>-man work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> is expected to return to production in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about a week</TIMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , which takes place at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon EDT</TIMEX> .
     The premium of cash <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> .
     Long-term support for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract was believed to be at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> a pound .
     A technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it .
     That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading .
     `` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Hanauer</ENAMEX> , a copper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rudolph Wolff & Co.</ENAMEX> , a major commodities trading and brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     But whether this price break has implications for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , he said , `` we will know more when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> copper stock levels are released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> . ''
     Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said he expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LME</ENAMEX> inventories to be down by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">about 15,000 tons</NUMEX> when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> report is issued .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Savaiko</ENAMEX> , senior commodities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , said that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LME</ENAMEX> stocks , they perceived a bearish sign .
     He also noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , who had been buying at prices just above the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> level , apparently pulled back from the market on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> said he sees a possibility of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract dropping to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.05</NUMEX> a pound .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> will announce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other .
     Called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Task Broker</ENAMEX> , the program acts something like an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auctioneer</ENAMEX> among a group of computers wired together .
     If a machine has a big computing task , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Task Broker</ENAMEX> asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job .
     It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> claims that the software allows a network to run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> program , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCarthy</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Forrester Research Inc.</ENAMEX> , a computer-market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , `` is a key building block as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> move to this new model of distributed processing . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
     With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> program , he said , `` You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . ''
     The program , which will be shipped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1990</TIMEX> , runs on the Unix operating system .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> will charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> for a license covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> .
     The program now works on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> workstations and on computers made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Multiflow Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Branford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> said it will sell versions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later next year</TIMEX> that run on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> machines .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Task Broker</ENAMEX> differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
     A previously available program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Network Computing System</ENAMEX> , developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
     But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
     Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Task Broker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> said , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Task Broker</ENAMEX> `` turns that network into -- as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is concerned -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> giant computer , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kay </ENAMEX>, general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> 's workstation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .

     Price wars between the fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> are starting to clobber the fast-food little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> : the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> .
     `` When <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> start fighting , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> get killed , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Riese</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Restaurants</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisee</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pizza Hut</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Roy Rogers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> .
     As hamburger and pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> saturate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area after another , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisers</ENAMEX> are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
     The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> `` used to offer discounts during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> when business was slow , but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last year or so</TIMEX> , discounting has become a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-month</TIMEX> thing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Harty </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charisma Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charisma</ENAMEX> 's sales are up slightly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX> says profits will be flat or lower .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Konopnicki</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Safford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">licensee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's Corp.</ENAMEX> who is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Operators Advisory Board</ENAMEX> , says some fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . ''
     Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 60.1 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wendy 's International Inc.</ENAMEX> slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rohs</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co</ENAMEX> .
     That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
     The situation was further aggravated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this month</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
     It also decided to go national with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizza</ENAMEX> , which it has been test-marketing .
     Now , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> deals on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizza</ENAMEX> are common ; so are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">99-cent</NUMEX> specials on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sandwiches</ENAMEX> normally priced twice as high .
     The discounting , say fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
     The result is that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and working harder to make less .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Mack</ENAMEX> , a district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cormack Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Omaha</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> '' to keep sales level .
     `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D'Agosto</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Panda 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arby 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Omaha</ENAMEX> , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> coming , but we are n't increasing sales . ''
     With fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> say that they wo n't go into a fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> unless they get a coupon . ''
     If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> will close or merge , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Morrissey</ENAMEX> , who owns a string of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> .
     `` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says .
     `` Fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisers</ENAMEX> have managed to squeeze in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> into every corner available . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Restaurant Association</ENAMEX> says quick-service restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131,146</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1983 and 1987</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last year</TIMEX> for which figures are available .

     Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rohs</ENAMEX> , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wendy 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> have trailed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> levels throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Greenberg</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales .
     He adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> . ''
     Profit margins at company-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg </ENAMEX>.
     Profits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> have n't been higher since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> , he adds .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> .
     Smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> and single-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operators</ENAMEX> will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to fail , many in the industry predict .
     Big franchise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrissey </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisee</ENAMEX> , notes that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Franchisees</ENAMEX> ca n't be forced to go along with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchiser</ENAMEX> 's discounting .
     But once a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisee</ENAMEX> agrees to a promotional program , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchiser</ENAMEX> can demand full participation to the very end , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lew Rudnick</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rudnick & Wolfe</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> with franchise industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> .
     He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> from deceptive marketing .
     In any case , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">franchisees</ENAMEX> , in order to stay on good terms with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisers</ENAMEX> , routinely go along with promotions .
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riese</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Restaurants</ENAMEX> : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> .

     And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> audit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie Jackson</ENAMEX> , the retired baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> , has found another use for them .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> , who won the nickname `` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">October</ENAMEX> '' for his <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> through a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 500</NUMEX> each .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> say the budding trade in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's canceled checks is unusual .
     `` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Smalling</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ames</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , and a recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in the field of baseball autographs .
     An initial batch of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Labor Day weekend</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .
     `` For someone who has everything else -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie</ENAMEX> 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Vizas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bill 's Sports Collectibles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> , who examined the checks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> card show .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> have been bought and sold .
     But these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> were dead .
     `` Maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> , there were a lot of -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty -RCB- Cobbs</ENAMEX> in the hobby , and awhile back there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Ruth</ENAMEX> checks , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> .
     However , the thought of a living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> selling his checks rubs some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the wrong way .
     `` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Machon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Papa 's Sports Cards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Menlo Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX>
     `` Who knows how much they 'll be worth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">100 years from now</TIMEX> ? ''
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> does n't believe they 're worth all that much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> .
     `` I do n't think the checks are worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> apiece , '' he says .
     Why Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson </ENAMEX>, who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .
     He probably has n't done it for the cash .
     `` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Merola</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> 's based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` He has good investments . ''
     And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> probably has opened new checking accounts , too .
     Or at least he should .
     `` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
     `` I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX Corp.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kobe Steel Ltd.</ENAMEX> , agreed to form a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> to build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market .
     Terms were n't disclosed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which will have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">600,000 tons</NUMEX> .
     The move by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LTV Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Armco Inc.</ENAMEX> all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> .
     The surge in production , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
     They note that most of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> will come on line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports .
     `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bradford</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . ''
     He does add , however , that transplanted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are boosting the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> , instead of relying heavily on imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> .
     That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sheet</ENAMEX> .
     The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmakers</ENAMEX> wanting to maintain an edge over smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">minimills</ENAMEX> and reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">mills</ENAMEX> -- those spun off to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> said it expects the market for coated sheet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> to reach <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">12 million tons</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">10.2 million tons</NUMEX> shipped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first eight months of 1989</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , while overall steel shipments were up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2.4 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kobe Steel</ENAMEX> hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> partnership by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> , with construction tentatively slated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring of 1990</TIMEX> and production by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> already has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> lines in existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> producing hot-dipped galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , but this marks the first so-called greenfield <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> for such production .
     Moreover , it will boost by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USX</ENAMEX> 's current hot-dipped capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">1,275,000 tons</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Steelmakers</ENAMEX> have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> to be covered with a thicker coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">zinc</ENAMEX> more quickly .

     ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ?
     You just call your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> and say `` buy '' or `` sell . ''
     Dream on .
     There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
     So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order .
     And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> can refuse to enter it for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> .
     Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , since it imposes no price restrictions .
     With a market order , an investor tells a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> to buy or sell `` at the market . ''
     It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . ''
     For example , if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> is being offered at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.065</NUMEX> and bid at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.060</NUMEX> , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .
     A recent indictment alleges that some floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> used market orders to fill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     Limit Order : Limit orders are used when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
     Suppose an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> wants to sell a stock , but not for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 55</NUMEX> .
     A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> risk : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> may regret the restriction if the stock reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> and then falls .
     Unless the market goes at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price .
     Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
     Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> can get .
     Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
     While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
     In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
     The crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's sell-off painfully taught some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who may have placed a stop-loss order at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90</NUMEX> under a stock that was trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> a share on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75</NUMEX> when the stock opened at that price on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
     Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
     If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .
     But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
     Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
     However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
     As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> will fill it at the best possible price .
     Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of several associated with the timing of trades .
     It instructs a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
     But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Bessemer</ENAMEX> , who came in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> in the stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of the recently completed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">U.S. Trading Championship</ENAMEX> , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options .
     `` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says .
     `` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . ''
     Not-Held Order : This is another timing order .
     It is a market order that allows floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
     Not-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> 's risk .
     One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> orders in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> to fill whichever order they can <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and then cancel the other order .
     In a fast-moving market , it prevents an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> from getting stuck with having made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trades on the same security .
     Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
     `` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders .
     For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few minutes</TIMEX> of trading for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the closing minutes</TIMEX> of trading .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Day</TIMEX> orders '' expire at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the day</TIMEX> on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> assume that all orders are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> orders unless specified otherwise .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .
     They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">months earlier</TIMEX> and had forgotten to cancel .
     It is always the responsibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to keep track of the orders they have placed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences .

     IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> better not ignore its limitations , either .
     Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
     For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
     Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
     The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index , is always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> .
     So a stock with a beta of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as volatile , one at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> more volatile , and so on .
     Cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should generally go with stocks that have low betas .
     Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
     Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .
     `` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Sharpe</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford University</ENAMEX> emeritus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> who developed the measure .
     `` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . ''
     In particular , beta does n't measure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .
     That `` business '' risk is very significant for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .
     Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drummer</ENAMEX> .
     In particular , the prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">gold</ENAMEX> and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .
     Concern that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> could misinterpret such readings led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Association of Individual Investors</ENAMEX> to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> edition of its mutual-fund guide .
     `` Our fear was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Markese</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .

     READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ?
     First , a pop quiz .
     When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ?
     Pencils down .
     If you 're like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> tend to see risk primarily on that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dimension , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Kochis</ENAMEX> , national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of personal financial planning for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deloitte </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Haskins & Sells .</ENAMEX>
     But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
     This is clearly not good news to all you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who sleep like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> CDs .
     Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
     But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
     Risk is also a function of time .
     When financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
     Stocks are much riskier than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills , for example , because the range in performance from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the best years</TIMEX> to the worst is much wider .
     That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> results from the average return over time .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
     For instance , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have sworn off stocks since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> market crash ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
     But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
     By retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
     `` That 's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven B. Enright</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seidman Financial Services</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ' portfolios .
     They estimate the return a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> .
     They try to figure out the long-term results the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> needs to meet major goals .
     And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified .
     The portfolios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> at retirement age and another a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 45</TIMEX> , illustrate several types of risk that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> need to consider .
     For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
     But they expose the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
     The younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .
     Note that the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's portfolio has a higher expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> return , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.1 %</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 %</NUMEX> , as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seidman Financial Services</ENAMEX> , which is the financial-planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">affiliate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BDO Seidman</ENAMEX> .
     That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seidman</ENAMEX> estimates for the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's portfolio .
     -LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard deviation to it .
     Then take the expected return and subtract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard deviation .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
     Then add and subtract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations to get a wider range .
     There 's a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> probability <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">any year</TIMEX> 's result will fall in the range . -RRB-
     Of course , the greater volatility of the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> ' long-term goals .
     Indeed , the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans .
     `` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Cammack</ENAMEX> , a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     `` But they may pay a price <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 or 20 years</TIMEX> in the future . ''

     When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way .
     Looking to the past can provide some clues .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several decades</TIMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself .
     For instance , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market .
     And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past .

     THROUGHOUT <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">THE 1980s</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning .
     Capital has been democratized , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want in .
     Too often , however , small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of fiduciary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> .
     Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit !
     This is particularly good news for those who hate risk , who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way .
     You know who you are .
     My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion .
     Like all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> seeking chronic prosperity , I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only to assuage my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX> , who believes in such things .
     So throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market .
     Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative .
     Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> demonstrates the performance of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> I 've invested in during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this prosperous decade</TIMEX> -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 20 , 1989</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> , began a slow recovery .
     Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pru-Bache</ENAMEX> to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it . ''
     Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health .
     Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , at which time it posted the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> negative compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> growth rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already !
     We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it .
     Bank it ?
     Not really !
     Sock it away in long-term instruments ?
     Nonsense !
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">Daily</TIMEX> living is the best possible investment !
     Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's toys ; gardening equipment , <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all .
     All have paid off for me in double-digit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> growth and continue to provide significant potential .
     At least , according to my calculations .
     Personal space -LRB- Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -RRB- has grown <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> , a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> , which my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> got into and sort of regrets to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this day</TIMEX> .
     The assortment of expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -LRB- Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> -RRB- has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for my record collection , whose worth , I think it 's safe to say , is incalculable .
     Continued investment in my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">subcompact</ENAMEX> has been part of my strategy -LRB- Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> -RRB- , with present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> contributions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> equaling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> 's original value .
     According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 22,000</NUMEX> on the open market -LRB- Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> -RRB- , where I plan to offer it shortly .
     Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> fitting to its suburban locale .
     I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lodgings</ENAMEX> will never be short of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> .
     My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .
     At the same time , my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning .
     Over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the decade</TIMEX> , for instance , my return on investment in the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX> alone -LRB- Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7A</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX> -RRB- has been most impressive , showing bodacious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> expansion with -- given the way my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> play -- no sign of abatement into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> and beyond .
     With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage .
     My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it .
     But with every step I take , I 'm building wealth .
     You can , too , if you , like me , refuse to bite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">bullet</ENAMEX> .
     So go out there and eat that debt .
     You 're right there in the mainstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business , building value on the back of insupportable expenditures .

     WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JAMES SCHWARTZ</ENAMEX> was just a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> gave him a piece of career advice .
     `` He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz </ENAMEX>, now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">40</TIMEX> .
     He tried management consulting , traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">turquoise</ENAMEX> for a while , and even managed professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX> .
     Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning .
     It should be noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz </ENAMEX>, who operates out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Englewood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo.</ENAMEX> , is a puckish sort who likes to give his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> the needle .
     But in this case the needle has a very sharp point .
     Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wag</ENAMEX> puts it , `` anybody who can fog a mirror '' can call himself a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Planners</ENAMEX> now influence the investment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred billion dollars</NUMEX> , but in effect they operate in the dark .
     There is no effective regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> got into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> -- no way to assess their performance , no way even to know how many of them there are -LRB- estimates range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450,000</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning .
     So it should come as no shock that the profession , if that 's what it is , has attracted a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ' money .
     Alarmed , state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> and reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of them want comprehensive standards , too ; they 're tired of seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX> and greedier than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> .
     But reform has n't taken hold yet .
     `` The industry is still pretty much in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Wild West</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">days</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Stapf</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of investor education for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">North American Securities Administrators Association</ENAMEX> .
     An admittedly limited survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NASAA</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are state securities-law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> , found that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1986 and 1988</TIMEX> `` fraud and abuse '' by financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rogues</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">gallery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> involved includes some convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX> , a compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who scammed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> .
     What 's more , the losses they and the others caused `` are just what we are stumbling over , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stapf</ENAMEX> , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
     So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> .
     Nobody can estimate the toll , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gargan</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Association of Registered Financial Planners</ENAMEX> , thinks the danger to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> .
     Surveying all this , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now think the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> might be no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> at all .
     For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Roper</ENAMEX> , who follows financial-planning issues for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Consumer Federation of America</ENAMEX> , a consumer-advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     She concedes that such a position is `` unfair '' to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of conscientious and qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> plying the trade , but as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> advocate she feels impelled to take it .
     She says her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> used to give tips on selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> -- check educational and experience credentials , consult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Better Business Bureaus</ENAMEX> -- but found that even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who took these steps `` were still getting ripped off . ''
     The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tax Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> , and the stock market crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year</TIMEX> did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
     But membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">International Association of Financial Planners</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IAFP</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the industry 's biggest trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , is still nearly triple what it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , and it 's believed that the ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> who do n't belong to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> have soared as well .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">An estimated 10 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are now using financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
     A survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54,000</NUMEX> of them conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IAFP</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> showed that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> alone had controlled or guided the investment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 154 billion</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ' money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous 12 months</TIMEX> .
     The sheer number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate .
     Even the minority of them who must register with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> as `` investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> '' -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> 's capacity .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> assigned to keep tabs on investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> -- about the same as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> -- even though the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> has tripled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15,000</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> .
     Currently , a registered investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> can expect an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> audit only once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">12 years</TIMEX> .
     A lot of bad things can happen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 years</TIMEX> .
     `` It does n't take a rocket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> to figure out our problem , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn McGrath </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> has proposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> patterned on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX> , which operates in the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     Such an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> who broke the rules .
     The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz </ENAMEX>, the puckish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Englewood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo.</ENAMEX> , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dracula</ENAMEX> in charge of the blood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tampa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> who heads <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> to hire more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX> 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IAFP</ENAMEX> , the major industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IAFP</ENAMEX> recently assembled other industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to discuss common standards that might be applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> was excluded .
     That may be because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX> , smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , enrolled his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Beauregard</ENAMEX> , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IAFP</ENAMEX> .
     Then he sent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pooch</ENAMEX> 's picture with the certificate of membership -- it was made out to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Boris ` Bo ' Regaard</ENAMEX> '' -- to every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> he could think of . -RRB-
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NASAA</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> of state securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> , is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     It requires financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to register with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , pass competency tests and reveal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> any conflicts of interest .
     The most common conflict involves compensation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NASAA</ENAMEX> estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 90 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend .
     The issue : Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> putting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ?
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> got an order from a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albany</ENAMEX> shutting down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Meridian Corp.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Albany</ENAMEX> financial-planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that had invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million</NUMEX> on behalf of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     In its notice of action , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had promised to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> alleged , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> consistently shoved unwary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> into high-risk investments in paintings , coins and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">condos</ENAMEX> .
     Those investments paid big commissions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> , payments <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were never told about , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> alleged .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .
     In practice , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> alleged in an affidavit , if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> had access to cash `` the chances of being turned down by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> were about as probable as being rejected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Book-of-the-Month Club</ENAMEX> . ''
     And , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> added , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger V. Sala</ENAMEX> , portrayed himself as a `` financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> '' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> , and a stint as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> at a highway toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">booth</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Manion</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> denies any wrongdoing and adds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> 's contentions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> 's business practices are incorrect .
     As for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX> 's qualifications , `` the snooty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> decided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX> was n't qualified because he did n't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> degree , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manion</ENAMEX> .
     Civil suits against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">clients</ENAMEX> seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> such actions , both filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> , could be particularly embarrassing to the industry : both name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Chandler Peterson</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> who is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">IAFP</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> suit , filed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , charges that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> misused much of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.7 million</NUMEX> put into a limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in which he had an interest .
     Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , in turn , paid Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> commissions and fees , the suit alleges .
     The other suit was filed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in a dispute over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> investments each says he made with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> as part of an effort to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Scottsdale</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Scottsdale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz .</ENAMEX>
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000</NUMEX> to join a sort of investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">club</ENAMEX> which essentially gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> .
     In affidavits , each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX> claims Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> promised the bank purchase would be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1988</TIMEX> or the money returned .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> ' and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' money to a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> .
     Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots , he opened up his briefcase and dumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> in cash on a table in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Diebel</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     `` He said he wanted to show the color of his money , '' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diebel</ENAMEX> .
     Bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , however , showed him the door , and the sale never came off .
     According to the suit , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> has yet to return the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> ' investment .
     They want it back .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> declines to comment on specific allegations in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> suits , saying he prefers to save such responses for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     But he does say that all of his activities have been `` entirely proper . ''
     On the suit by the limited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> , he says he is considering a defamation suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> .
     The suit , he adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     Rearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> truths . ''
     He declines to go into specifics .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> generally are more prone to sue .
     `` I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> also says he does n't consider himself a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> anymore .
     He now calls himself an `` investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> . ''
     In many scams or alleged scams involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> would have kept them out of harm 's way .
     Using it , would n't a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proessional</ENAMEX> hesitate to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of thousands of dollars</NUMEX> just for a chance to invest witha <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> ?
     Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
     Certificates of deposit do n't pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</NUMEX> a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> .
     Now they 're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> and he 's in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Mobile County</ENAMEX> .
     CDs yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Marshall Islands</ENAMEX> is merely a mail drop watched over by a local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">gas-station</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> -- but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fell for that one too .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> who promised to make some of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX> on investments of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as litle as $ 100</NUMEX> ?

     This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 70,000</NUMEX> is known for sunshine , yachts and rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> .
     It is also known as the fraud capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , dubbed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> and the media as the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cote de Fraud</ENAMEX> '' .
     How does a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> famous for its high living end up as a haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">low-lifes</ENAMEX> ?
     Clearly , the existence of the former lures the latter .
     The places renowned for breeding bunco , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> neighborhood known as the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Maggot Mile</ENAMEX> '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">high rollers</ENAMEX> , glamorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and lots of sunshine .
     You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Green Bay</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Buffalo</ENAMEX> .
     Con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> hate snow .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> fits the scam <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> ' specifications perfectly .
     What more could a con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in search of the easy life ask for ?
     Nothing seems hard here .
     The breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> sway lazily .
     Nightlife is plentiful .
     Moreover , ostentation is appreciated .
     The median price of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 547,000</NUMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 9,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vessels</ENAMEX> fill what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber of commerce</ENAMEX> calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blondes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cocaine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Corvettes</ENAMEX> , '' mutters Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McClelland </ENAMEX>.
     `` That 's what they 're after . ''
     The rich image of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> also helps lend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">con artists</ENAMEX> ' operation an air of respectability .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason they use <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Katz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> who , until recently , headed a multi-agency <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southern California</ENAMEX> fraud task <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">force</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> is known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> for having a lot of rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . ''
     No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Bible</ENAMEX> sales to crooked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> to bogus penny-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     But above all , this is the national <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">headquarters</ENAMEX> for boiler-room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> , those slick-talking snake-oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> who use the telephone to extract money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gullible</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greedy</ENAMEX> and then vanish .
     Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> really harvest .
     `` I 've heard that there is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion</NUMEX> taken in nationwide by boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every year</TIMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McClelland</ENAMEX> says .
     `` If that 's true , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Orange County</ENAMEX> has to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 10 %</NUMEX> of that . ''
     And most of the truly big scams in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Orange County</ENAMEX> seem to originate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the other well-heeled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">communities</ENAMEX> that surround this sliver-like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">city</ENAMEX> that hooks around a point of land on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> coast south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> '' operations .
     That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> '' scams .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousands of dollars</NUMEX> a shot .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> range from elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widows</ENAMEX> to affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ingenious recent example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Trust Inc.</ENAMEX> were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">jury</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     Thus falsely reassured , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> sent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.4 million</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Jones</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard O. Kelly Sr.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Trust</ENAMEX> , says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> denies that there was any attempt to defraud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> says , `` but no intent to defraud . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> operations differ from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> in style as well as in dollars .
     Traditionally , boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> operate on the cheap , since few , if any , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ever visit their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scammers</ENAMEX> to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> .
     But , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , `` the interesting thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> , with plush furnishings .
     When we go there , it 's quite different from these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> places where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sandwiches</ENAMEX> are spread out on the table and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are picking their noses . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> also tend to indulge themselves privately .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> cite the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Valentine</ENAMEX> , who is currently serving a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-year</TIMEX> sentence at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Lompoc Federal Prison</ENAMEX> for his role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intech Investment Corp.</ENAMEX> , which promised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> returns of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 625 %</NUMEX> on precious metals .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentine</ENAMEX> , who pleaded guilty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> counts of fraud in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , drove a leased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> and lived in an expensive home on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Lido Isle</ENAMEX> , an island in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newport</ENAMEX> 's harbor , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> .
     With the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 million</NUMEX> received from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , he took frequent junkets with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to exotic locales and leased an expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BMW</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> , whom he met at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> where he got his custom-tailored suits .
     `` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">track</ENAMEX> or to the tables in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> says .
     All this talk of boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">rooms</ENAMEX> and fraud is unnerving to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's legitimate business element .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent M Ciavarella</ENAMEX> , regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Property Management Systems</ENAMEX> , insists he does n't know of any bogus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">telemarketers</ENAMEX> operating in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">the 1.6 million square feet</NUMEX> of office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">space</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Fashion Island</ENAMEX> that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> leases for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Irvine Co.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">owner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developer</ENAMEX> of the project .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciavarella</ENAMEX> has rejected a few prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">tenants</ENAMEX> who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">operators</ENAMEX> `` are not easily detectable .

     YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education .
     Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson : How to send your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to college .
     True , when you went to college , there was n't that much to learn .
     Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow .
     Now , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> a ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Prestige U.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">18 years</TIMEX> .
     In short , throw away the passbook and go for the glory .
     The reason is cost .
     Nothing in the annals of tuition readied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     Tuitions at private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">154 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 10 years ended in June of this year</TIMEX> ; that 's twice the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77 %</NUMEX> increase in consumer prices for the same period .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> now goes for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19,395</NUMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2007</TIMEX> , when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newborns</ENAMEX> hit campus , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> Ivy League sheepskin will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300,000</NUMEX> , give or take a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizzas-with-everything</ENAMEX> at exam time .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">MIT</ENAMEX> and other utmosts will cost no less .
     So what 's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> to do ?
     Some investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> are suggesting , in effect , a bet on a start-up investment pool -- maybe even on margin .
     Others prefer deep-discount <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon bonds .
     Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ?
     `` You 're not going to make it in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> bank account , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Riepe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of mutual funds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> .
     To get the necessary growth , adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Ruffel</ENAMEX> , a marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Programs</ENAMEX> mutual-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , `` you need to go to the stock market . ''
     In other words , a little volatility never hurt .
     It never hurt anyone , that is , unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to .
     Or the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> 's tuition .
     That 's the dilemma for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> .
     Although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are advising risk , no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off .
     Help may be on the way .
     The antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> .
     Fear of the price <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> could help cool things off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     And then there 's always <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">State U</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ' craving for a top-rated education for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wine</ENAMEX> .
     Belatedly aware of public concern , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middlemen</ENAMEX> are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes .
     Their message , explicit or implicit , is that a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
     Forget about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills or a money-market fund .
     The latest wave of marketing is instructive .
     Several outfits -- including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Programs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> mutual-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edward D. Jones</ENAMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> -- are advertising `` college planner '' tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
     The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> -- a rate historically obtainable by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> place , the stock market .
     Most of the mailers are free , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Programs</ENAMEX> sells , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> , a version customized to the age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> of choice .
     The figures are shocking .
     To build a nest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> that would pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Stanford</ENAMEX> when a current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first-grader</ENAMEX> reaches college age , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would need to set aside <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 773.94</NUMEX> a month -- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 years</TIMEX> .
     They can cut this to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 691.09</NUMEX> a month if the investing keeps up through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> .
     And they can further reduce the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> amount if they start saving earlier -- when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> come home from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> .
     Plugging a cheaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can live with .
     Using a recent average private-school cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 12,500</NUMEX> a year , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">T. Rowe Price</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> prescribes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 450</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> if the plan begins when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">six</TIMEX> .
     Since the formula assumes an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> before-tax return in a mutual fund , there would also be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16,500</NUMEX> in taxes to pay over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the 12 years</TIMEX> .
     Not everyone is so pessimistic .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are basically peddling a lot of fear , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Hauptman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">American Council on Education</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> ' own contribution , which reduces most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ' burden substantially .
     Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into putting aside a little more .
     `` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says .
     `` That 's crazy . ''
     His advice : Do n't panic .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds .
     That way , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hauptman</ENAMEX> reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages .
     He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
     In their anxiety , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">benefactors</ENAMEX> are flocking to new schemes .
     They have laid out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</NUMEX> for so-called baccalaureate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     And they have bought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 500 million</NUMEX> in prepaid-tuition plans , offered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> .
     The prepaid plans take payment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> -- usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount -- for a promise that tuition will be covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     The baccalaureate bonds -- tax-free , offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity -- seem to be tailor-made for college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> .
     Like other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zeros</NUMEX> , they pay all their interest at maturity , meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> can time things so that their bonds pay off just when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junior</ENAMEX> graduates from high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     Their compounding effect is also alluring .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Virginia</ENAMEX> sold bonds for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 268.98</NUMEX> that will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2009</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Anderson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Forum for College Financing Alternatives</ENAMEX> , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Columbia University</ENAMEX> , a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">group</ENAMEX> partly financed by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zeros</NUMEX> are particularly ill-suited .
     Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
     That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal .
     Had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zeros</NUMEX> been available in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> and had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> bought a face amount equal to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four years</TIMEX> ' tuition at the time , aiming for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> figures .
     Most other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better .
     The prepaid plans may be a good bet , provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure .
     Issuing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> generally limit the guarantees to in-state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> , however , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> get refunds without much interest if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do n't attend the specified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> are seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> wants the prestige <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> to sponsor such a plan .
     The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee .
     Prepayments , much like mutual-fund purchases , are pooled for investment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">Sponsors</ENAMEX> are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">sponsors</ENAMEX> ' funds are taxable .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">colleges</ENAMEX> , as educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> , had hoped that would n't be the case .
     Based on historical rates of return , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> reckons a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> stock portfolio , indexed to the market , would have kept up with tuition and taxes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">sponsors</ENAMEX> might not pick the stocks that will match the market .
     And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases .
     `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson </ENAMEX>.
     What happens if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">sponsors</ENAMEX> do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> , meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> will pick up any slack .
     Not so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> .
     Its plan is set up as an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> says there 's no worry -- investment returns , combined with fees and the gains from unused plans , will provide all the cash it needs .

     AMONG THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">CATFISH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in the watery delta land of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Humphreys County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Miss.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen D. Tharp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Isola</ENAMEX> was one of the best known and most enterprising .
     He sold <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">quarter-inch</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fingerlings</ENAMEX> to stock other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> ' ponds , and he bought back <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">one-pound-or-so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">food-fish</ENAMEX> that he `` live-hauled '' to market along with his own whiskery <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crop</ENAMEX> .
     And he nearly always bought and sold for cash .
     Along the way , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tharp</ENAMEX> omitted a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 million</NUMEX> from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> .
     The returns landed in the hands of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel James Baker</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> interviewed or wrote to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">live-haulers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">processors</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South</ENAMEX> before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tharp</ENAMEX> and others .
     Unknown to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tharp</ENAMEX> , he had fouled his net on a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> project to catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haulers</ENAMEX> inclined to cheat on their taxes .
     Confronted with the evidence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tharp</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> charge of filing a false return and was fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,000</NUMEX> and sentenced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">18 months</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">prison</ENAMEX> .
     He also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties .
     A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> out there are n't as paranoid as one might think .
     Federal and state tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enforcers</ENAMEX> develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions .
     Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> who raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">racehorses</ENAMEX> on their days off .
     Mail-order <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> have been squelched .
     Now , television and radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelists</ENAMEX> are under scrutiny .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> recently won part of its long-running battle with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Church of Scientology</ENAMEX> over exemptions when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> held that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> ' payments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">church</ENAMEX> were n't deductible because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> received services in return .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> statistics show that the more persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hiders</ENAMEX> of income among sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> include used-car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> , entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masons</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roofers</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> .
     Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> in general account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 40 %</NUMEX> of unreported personal income , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> has said .
     Once such abuses become so pervasive , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">San Franciscans</ENAMEX> have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> envy their life styles .
     Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">offices</ENAMEX> , have gaped so broadly that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has passed stringent laws to close them .
     Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
     And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> .
     Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> of alimony -LRB- who gets a deduction -RRB- must report the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> number .
     Passport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> now must give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> numbers , enabling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> to see whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> living abroad are filing required <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> returns .
     But while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> computers focus routinely on target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> like these , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> has assigned many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to special projects that need more personal attention .
     In most cases , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> claiming that having a multitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX> frees them from tax withholding or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">yacht</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> deducting losses from sideline charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     The national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> currently has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> noncriminal audit projects , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall V. Washburn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy assistant commissioner</ENAMEX> for examination .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like .
     The targeted audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> include direct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cosmetics</ENAMEX> , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> who label <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> as independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
     Other projects look for offenders among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> who get cash tips , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who engage in large cash transactions , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose returns show they sold a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the same year</TIMEX> ; the gain must be rolled over within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> to defer tax .
     And now that returns must show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> numbers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> wants to see which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX> show up on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> return -- and which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX> turn out to be deceased .
     Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some years back</TIMEX> .
     It prompted an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> study that found many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washburn</ENAMEX> says .
     The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tax Court</ENAMEX> recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter S. Rubin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cherry Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , who both were part-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amway</ENAMEX> products in addition to their regular jobs as sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in other fields .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , they reported gross income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,647</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amway</ENAMEX> sales , offset by expenses totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16,746</NUMEX> -- including car costs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6,805</NUMEX> and travel and entertainment costs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,088</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tax Court</ENAMEX> did n't believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubins</ENAMEX> , who earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 65,619</NUMEX> in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Direct Selling Association</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , points out that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">members</ENAMEX> , which include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amway Corp.</ENAMEX> , cooperate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> to distribute tax-compliance material to sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
     The independent-contractor project , which began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal nine months ended June 30</TIMEX> , reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond P. Keenan </ENAMEX>, assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> for collection , they examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 13,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">employers</ENAMEX> , assessed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 67 million</NUMEX> in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 56,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> instead of self-employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> .
     The number of misclassified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> may be in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</NUMEX> , mostly paid by small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> , want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> ca n't .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tipsters</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Lackey</ENAMEX> , who manages the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> project 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in north and central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Orlando</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Firms</ENAMEX> that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> that are n't , he says .
     In his area , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lackey</ENAMEX> continues , the miscreant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">employers</ENAMEX> most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work .
     But a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">clinic</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> wrongly listed all of them -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receptionists</ENAMEX> -- as independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> assessed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">clinic</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350,000</NUMEX> in back payroll taxes .
     It assessed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 500,000</NUMEX> against a cruise-ship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that carried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deckhands</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bartenders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entertainers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> as self-employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">independents</ENAMEX> .
     Revenue-short <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delinquents</ENAMEX> , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> since it acquired an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 million</NUMEX> computer system in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enforcers</ENAMEX> have amassed data bases from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agencies</ENAMEX> that license or register <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> ; from exchange agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">provinces</ENAMEX> , and even from phonebook <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yellow Pages</ENAMEX> .
     Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have n't filed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> income-tax returns .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has combed through records relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockbrokers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> area , construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> who claim to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> -- especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , which has no personal income tax .
     Soon to feel the glare of attention are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick G. Hicks </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the tax-department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> that develops the computer-matching programs .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> has collected over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.5 million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> so far and recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> of them for criminal prosecution .
     In the early stage of checking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with incomes exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.5 million</NUMEX> out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was posing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> .
     `` We think we can reclaim <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> just through the nonresident project , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hicks</ENAMEX> declares .

     Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> is relatively low , boosting admits from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> will boost registrants from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 31 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">perhaps 5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">registrants</ENAMEX> will come from a new category consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> category .
     But against that combined increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-language proficiency and an essay .
     This category now accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 19 %</NUMEX> of admits and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">registrants</ENAMEX> .
     The plan thus will decrease by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> , for a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> , the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> admitted primarily by academic criteria .
     Who will take over these places ?
     The plan creates a new category of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the plan 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
     Perhaps it does .
     But the new category does not replace or reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 's broad racial preferences .
     Nor will <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from racial-minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action `` target '' for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> .
     The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race .
     The role of academic criteria in choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freshmen</ENAMEX> can only decline as a result .

     FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others , read on .
     This is a story about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX> .
     Most of us know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> .
     Many of us are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX> .
     But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> .
     What makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> blurt out their credit-card numbers to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> they 've never heard of ?
     Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> ?
     What makes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> buy an oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> from some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> knocking on the screen door ?
     Or an interest in a retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nevada</ENAMEX> that will knock your socks off , once it is built ?
     Because in the end , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> always wind up asking themselves the same question : `` How could I be so stupid ? ''
     There are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> know all of them .
     `` These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are very skilled at finding out what makes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> tick , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Neal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the economic-crime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Broward County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State Attorney</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , a major haven for boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> .
     `` Once they size them up , then they know what buttons to push . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blodgett</ENAMEX> agrees -- and he ought to know .
     He used to be a boiler-room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> , peddling investments in oil and gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> and rare coins .
     `` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he says .
     The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns .
     `` We 're all a little greedy .
     Everyone is vulnerable , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Harper</ENAMEX> , associate regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> .
     `` These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> prey on human frailties . ''
     While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> folklore .
     `` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed McMahon</ENAMEX> making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Cunningham </ENAMEX>, an associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of psychology at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Kentucky</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> .
     `` Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are making it overnight , and the rest who toil <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . ''
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer Barasch</ENAMEX> , branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> for enforcement at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> : `` Why do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> play the lottery when the odds are great against them ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are shooting for a dream . ''
     Clearly , though , scam <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> ; the psychology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX> is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
     There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">in-crowd</ENAMEX> .
     So <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> popular ploy is to make a prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> feel like an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> , joining an exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> that is about to make a killing .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Between 1978 and 1987</TIMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SH Oil</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Winter Haven</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , sold interests in oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> to a very select group of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> , while turning away numerous other eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Smith</ENAMEX> , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> that he had a secret agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco Oil Co.</ENAMEX> and said the location of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comptroller</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> agreement nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">wells</ENAMEX> existed , the suit alleged .
     Such schemes , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Adamski</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the financial-crimes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> being given this opportunity . ''
     At times , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is being included in , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham </ENAMEX>.
     In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> can insist that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> from consulting with others .
     It also adds to the mystery of the venture .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blodgett</ENAMEX> , the boiler-room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> , believes that for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
     `` Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got into it , I was allowing them to live a dream , '' he says .
     He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">well</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that week</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . ''
     -LRB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blodgett</ENAMEX> , who was convicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> of selling unregistered securities and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation .
     He says he has quit the business and is back in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . -RRB-
     For some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived .
     `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Andreassen</ENAMEX> , an associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of psychology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> .
     Conservative appearances make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think it 's a conservative investment .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Wenz</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Phoenix</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ariz.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wenz</ENAMEX> , who says he lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43,000</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> precious-metals deal and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39,000</NUMEX> in another , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's liability , and an insurance policy .
     When he visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . ''
     Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Watson</ENAMEX> , commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Los Angeles Police Department</ENAMEX> 's bunko-forgery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> .
     Born-again <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Christians</ENAMEX> are the most visible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches .
     But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and prevent the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Psychologists</ENAMEX> say isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud .
     Scam <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> seek out such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> -- or try to make sure that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> isolate themselves .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> may counter a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> ? ''
     Or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> who wants his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> 's advice may be told , `` You seem like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who can make up his own mind . ''
     Often con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> will try to disarm their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> by emphasizing similarities between them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lynes </ENAMEX>, a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX> , says he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lily </ENAMEX>, warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddler</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stuart-James Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> told them he , too , had once worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyneses</ENAMEX> , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Powder Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga.</ENAMEX> , have filed suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Stuart James</ENAMEX> , alleging fraud .
     They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .
     They say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> took them out for lunch frequently .
     He urged them to refer their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> , who also lost money .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trinen</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for the penny-brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , denies the fraud allegations and says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyneses</ENAMEX> were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment . -RRB-
     `` It 's not uncommon for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to send pictures of themselves or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to ingratiate themselves to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terree Bowers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the major-frauds section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> say that whatever a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> 's particular weak point , timing is crucial .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives .
     `` Sometimes when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Elvekrog</ENAMEX> , a licensed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> who is now an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seger-Elvekrog Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Birmingham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , investment-counseling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . ''
     They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money - <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> fretting over how to pay for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 's college expenses .
     `` These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
     Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerald Jellison</ENAMEX> , a psychology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Southern California</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FOX</ENAMEX> HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at least it 's exercise .
     At least it has a little dash .
     Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , drab duties rather than pleasures .
     Like trying to buy life insurance , for instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash .
     Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible .
     But sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work .
     And my time has come .
     I 'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">33</TIMEX> , married , no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , and employed in writing stories like this one .
     In times past , life-insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of household , meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , but ours is a two-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and accustomed to it .
     So if anything happened to me , I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">33-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts -LRB- though not , I admit , enough to put any potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in the lap of luxury -RRB- .
     Figuring that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000</NUMEX> would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , while I was thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX> hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations .
     Besides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .
     What to do ?
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , generalize .
     Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured</ENAMEX> is still alive .
     If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits .
     It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
     But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .
     It may also stipulate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured</ENAMEX> must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it .
     Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
     So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .
     There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> variation that appealed to me at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , to the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's credit-card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> .
     Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> said it would charge me <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 576</NUMEX> a year for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100,000</NUMEX> of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years</TIMEX> .
     Sounds great -- or does it ?
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5,760</NUMEX> I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10 years</TIMEX> of inflation ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> a real profit .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> and most important , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .
     That would be all right with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me .
     Which goes to show that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing .
     And the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> Law , unique to insurance ?
     If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> wins .
     Always .
     This is worth remembering when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value .
     The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .
     The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
     That is gilding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX> .
     The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is putting your money into .
     That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
     Again , no free lunch .
     This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's estimated liability in paying off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .
     And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the initial year or two</TIMEX> of the the policy is , in effect , paying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years</TIMEX> , largely because of this .
     So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
     The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
     You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> for tax reasons ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured</ENAMEX> could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> closed this loophole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , or thought it did .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Monarch Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Springfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .
     But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
     I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life .
     Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
     I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a given year</TIMEX> ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
     In looking at these and other policies , I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> .
     They commonly give <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> is based on interest rates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> guarantees -LRB- usually <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 % to 4.5 %</NUMEX> -RRB- and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.5 %</NUMEX> or more .
     Projecting the latter over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several decades</TIMEX> , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?
     Not likely , I think .
     Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 10th year</TIMEX> .
     These are not certain , either .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Pfiefer</ENAMEX> , an actuarial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tillinghast</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Towers Perrin Co.</ENAMEX> , the big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     Another factor to consider : Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .
     There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
     At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">John Hancock</ENAMEX> policy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . ''
     I call her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dominici</ENAMEX> .
     Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> cost of insurance protection .
     If interest rates plunge , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
     I do n't like the sound of that .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Daily</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX>-based financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     And the feature is so new , he adds , that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
     So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection .
     Offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> that include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jackson National Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Travelers Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .
     Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attarcks</ENAMEX> , renal failure and kidney transplants .
     But the catastrophic events for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policyholder</ENAMEX> can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
     Also , financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
     And considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> interested in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it .
     I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even though it turns out to be low-load life .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insureres</ENAMEX> selling these policies market them directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> or otherwise do n't use commissioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> ; there is still a load -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
     I compared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> universal policy for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130,000</NUMEX> face amount from such an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Life Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lincoln</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Neb.</ENAMEX> , with a similar offering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.</ENAMEX> , which operates through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> commissioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> I could walk away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ameritas</ENAMEX> policy with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 792</NUMEX> , but Id get only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable</ENAMEX> .
     The difference is magnified by time , too .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 65</TIMEX> , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ameritas</ENAMEX> offering would have a projected cash value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14,000</NUMEX> higher than the other , even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable</ENAMEX> 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .
     Did I buy it ?
     Well , not yet .
     I 'm thinking about using the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 871</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> premium to finance a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
