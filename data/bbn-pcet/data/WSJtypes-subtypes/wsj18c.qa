     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa German Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> reportedly plan to form an international air-freight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , a move that could further consolidate the industry .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX> reported that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems .
     They reportedly will invest a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 140 million</NUMEX> -RRB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> would be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     The action follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express Corp.</ENAMEX> 's acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Flying Tiger Line Inc.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     After that , `` it would make sense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> to talk about doing things jointly , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton Daly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">services</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Simat , Helliesen & Eichner Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Parcel Service of America Inc.</ENAMEX> and other fast-growing air-freight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> are talking about cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> , and there have been rumors about such a tie between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said he could n't confirm or deny the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> report .
     But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> is talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> about some sort of cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> .
     `` It is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> of a number of strategies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , '' the deadline for ending trade barriers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EC</ENAMEX> , he said .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> confirmed talks are under way , but declined to comment .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> 's cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toyko</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> for talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL </ENAMEX>.
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     `` Nothing is defined or signed at this point , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said of the talks .
     Whatever accord the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> reach , he said , he is skeptical it would create a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> pool their air-freight businesses , their clout would be considerable .
     According to figures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Air Transport Association</ENAMEX> , they carried a combined <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">1.8 million tons</NUMEX> of freight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Flying Tiger</ENAMEX> , as separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , carried <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a combined 2.6 million tons</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Air France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities .
     They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> would have access to the system , they said , and negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partners</ENAMEX> were already under way .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> operate extensive fleets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">freighters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747 Combis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> that carry both freight and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> on the main deck .
     They currently have large orders for cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX> , are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> to join , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">before the end of 1992</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> said it wanted to lease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> so it could funnel its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> to other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> destinations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> said it has n't received a proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> there were air-traffic negotiations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , a likely <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step to any commercial agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> or another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carrier</ENAMEX> .

     In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     The decision , which affects <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> of trading positions , was made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> 's options floor was shut down as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> could be traded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> said the cooperation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> would enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to buy and sell options listed solely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> said well over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> were taking flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBOE </ENAMEX>, where they would continue making markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>-listed options .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carpenters</ENAMEX> quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> options traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Trading was light on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's main floor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage .
     The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> has options for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> underlying stock issues , including highly active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton Hotels Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> said throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several days</TIMEX> .
     `` I 've told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> that they still have the ability to exercise their options , because they are guaranteed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing Corp.</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Schwartz </ENAMEX>, a senior registered options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer & Co .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> reassigned trading in the options , however , to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to do more than simply exercise the options .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's equities floor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> remained open on a limited basis , orders were being routed and executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls .
     `` It 's a very uncertain situation right now , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Navin Vyas</ENAMEX> , administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> of trading floor operations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> , which has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's computer was rerouting orders to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , `` business is as usual '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyas</ENAMEX> said .
     `` If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> is down , the other can take over . ''
     Meanwhile , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were trying to cope .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Daggs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sutro & Co.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> came to work at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 a.m. PDT</TIMEX> -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> in order to turn the power back on at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> there .
     That should happen by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows , despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls .
     Also , most of the telecommunications equipment was out .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were executing municipal bond , mutual fund and other orders through a sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tucker Anthony Inc.</ENAMEX> , which is also owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">John Hancock Freedom Securities</ENAMEX> but is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` We are having <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a regular day</TIMEX> .
     Volume is down out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , but not out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daggs</ENAMEX> added .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sutro</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> executed orders through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , which was n't affected by the quake .
     Others , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area , set up an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800</ENAMEX> number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to obtain market commentary and other help .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet White</ENAMEX> received calls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> who offered to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> .
     Then she discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> lines were down , because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> had to call other company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> to get quotes on stocks .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Call-In Center</ENAMEX> , which swung into action for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first time last month</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> , assembled a tactical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to begin rerouting lines and restore service to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> dispatched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area to do the work , though most of the rerouting was done by computer .
     Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , while just parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose</ENAMEX> were knocked out .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Irvine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> , said service was being restored to outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> areas .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing</ENAMEX> confirmed that it guarantees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> options .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> also will permit its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific exchange</ENAMEX> '' even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is closed , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Luthringshausen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Put options give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> the right , but not the obligation , to sell a financial instrument at a specified price , while call options give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> the right , but not the obligation , to buy a financial instrument at a specified price -RRB- .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> approved the purchase of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> of its common shares , a move that should help support its battered stock .
     Even as the stock market has generally done well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's shares have slipped steadily from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 130.875</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's closing price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 101.75</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> , in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , puts the stock at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 1\/2</NUMEX> times book value , which is as low as it has sunk over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> .
     The announcement came after the market 's close .
     The move by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> was n't exactly a surprise .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 5 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 3 1\/2 years</TIMEX> to buy back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 million</NUMEX> common shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 7 %</NUMEX> of those outstanding .
     In addition , despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's well-publicized recent problems , the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> still generates enormous amounts of cash .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the second quarter</TIMEX> , it had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.47 billion</NUMEX> of cash and marketable securities on hand .
     As a result , some securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had predicted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> would authorize additional purchases .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said that although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock , it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity .
     `` We view it as a good long-term investment , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     In the short term , the move is likely to have little effect .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's closing price , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> would buy back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 million</NUMEX> shares , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 2 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 580 million</NUMEX> outstanding .
     In addition , as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> still had authorization to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 368 million</NUMEX> of stock under a prior repurchase program .
     Over the long term , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's stock repurchases -- along with its hefty , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.84</NUMEX>-a-share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> -- are providing a floor for the stock price .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> produced its first strong results in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four years</TIMEX> and was expected to continue to roll <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , it began faltering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">as early as January</TIMEX> .
     First , it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's bread-and-butter business .
     Then it had a series of smaller glitches , including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations .
     Finally , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives , which account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> revenue .
     None of the problems is necessarily fatal , and they are n't all necessarily even related .
     There are also other factors at work that are outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's control , such as currency exchange rates .
     The strong dollar , which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars , is expected to knock <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 to 85 cents</NUMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's per-share earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the full year</TIMEX> .
     Without that problem , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> might have matched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.81 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.80</NUMEX> a share .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will take some convincing before they get back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's stock in a big way .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Milunovich</ENAMEX> , a securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> , said that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were looking for an excuse to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , even the big institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> are looking for a reason to avoid the stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> .

     On Wall Street <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the opening bell </TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> quickly began singling out shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> expected to profit or suffer in some way from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> disaster , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , construction-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , refiners and housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> .
     Brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> jumped in , touting `` post-quake demand '' stocks , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> set up a toll-free hot line for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Franciscans</ENAMEX> who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds .
     `` Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Gallagher</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     However , he added , such event-driven trading moves typically last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few hours</TIMEX> and are often made without full information .
     The most popular plays of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> were insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Re Corp.</ENAMEX> , which rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 86.50</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nac Re Corp.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37.75</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American International Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 102.625</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62.50</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conning & Co.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates , ending their long price wars .
     Before this bullish theory surfaced , some insurance stocks initially fell , indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> thought the quake might cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> a lot of money .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> , which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36.50</NUMEX> , said earthquake damage would slightly hurt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> profit .
     On the prospect for rebuilding northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> bid up cement-makers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Calmat Co.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28.75</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lone Star Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29.25</NUMEX> .
     Bridge and road <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">builders</ENAMEX> had a field day , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kasler Corp.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.125</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.875</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Guy F.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fluor Corp.</ENAMEX> , a construction engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , gained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33.375</NUMEX> .
     But home-building stocks were a mixed bag .
     Timber stocks got a big boost .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxxam Inc.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 43.75</NUMEX> , both reported strong profits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> touted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Louisiana Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Willamette Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> as the best post-quake plywood plays .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gainers</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> undamaged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refineries</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tosco Corp.</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.125 to $ 20.125</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> , despite a temporary pipeline shutdown , rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 to $ 65</NUMEX> .
     Meanwhile , shares of some big housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> got hit , on the likelihood that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> ' collateral -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value .

     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> thrift stocks also fell , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Golden West Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H.F.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Vincent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petco</ENAMEX> was withdrawing from the clearing business .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> got a look at the potential risks in this business , and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more , '' he said .
     He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petco</ENAMEX> remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's rebound .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> declined comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petco</ENAMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett Corp.</ENAMEX> , another options trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , transferred the clearing accounts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 160</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options of Chicago</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> , because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market slide .
     The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBOE </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Options Clearing Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Fossett</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fossett</ENAMEX> , joined in putting up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> to guarantee the accounts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Options .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of another small options clearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , who asked not to be identified , said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business .

     She represents a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> of savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> who puts bargain prices , nutritional and environmental concerns , and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty .
     While brand loyalty is far from dead , marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say it has eroded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marketers</ENAMEX> themselves are partly to blame : They 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising .
     What 's more , a flood of new products has given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> a dizzying choice of brands , many of which are virtually carbon copies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marketers</ENAMEX> have brought this on themselves with their heavy use '' of promotions , contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Plummer </ENAMEX>, an executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' survey <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> found that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> switch brands for many of the products they use .
     For the survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Peter D. Hart Research Associates</ENAMEX> asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> , including Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombardi </ENAMEX>, whether they usually buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> products included in the survey said they 're brand switchers .
     Overall , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are n't brand loyal for any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> product categories .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 47 %</NUMEX> are loyal for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one to five</NUMEX> of the products .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 2 %</NUMEX> are brand loyal in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 to 20</NUMEX> of the categories , and no one is loyal for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> types of products .
     For such products as canned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">vegetables</ENAMEX> and athletic shoes , devotion to a single brand was quite low , with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 30 %</NUMEX> saying they usually buy the same brand .
     Only for cigarettes , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">toothpaste</ENAMEX> did more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> say they typically stick with the same brand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors , such as cigarettes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">ketchup</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Huff</ENAMEX> , a respondent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Spokane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash.</ENAMEX> , says her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is adamant about eating only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">ketchup</ENAMEX> .
     He simply ca n't stomach the taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Heinz</ENAMEX> , she says .

     Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">beer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys , whether that 's macho <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> cigarettes or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Uninhibited</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">perfume</ENAMEX> .
     Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 23 %</NUMEX> of trash-bag users in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey usually buy the same brand , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 29 %</NUMEX> of battery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> stick to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> brand .
     Underwear scored a middling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> in brand loyalty , but consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product .
     `` In the past , you just wore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fruit of the Loom</ENAMEX> and did n't care , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Kim </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of consumer behavior research for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.

     He believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">marketer</ENAMEX> to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty .
     What loyalty there is to gas brands , he believes , is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stations</ENAMEX> .
     Brand loyalty was stronger among older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly one-fourth</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 60</TIMEX> and older claim brand loyalty for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> products in the survey ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9 %</NUMEX> of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 18 to 29</TIMEX> have such strong allegiance .
     Higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> also tend to be more brand loyal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey and other research studies indicate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marketers</ENAMEX> speculate that more affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price .
     An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality , if not always the best value for the money .
     It 's sort of loyalty by default .
     Meanwhile , `` the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurel Cutler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> of the ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">FCB\/Leber Katz Partners</ENAMEX> .
     `` They 're buying whatever 's cheaper . ''
     The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game : How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> will behave as they move into middle age .
     They grew up with more brand choices than any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and have shown less allegiance so far .
     But now that they 're settling down and raising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> , might they also show more stability in their brand choices ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX> does n't think so .
     He believes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties .
     `` Earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> were brand loyal across categories , '' he says , `` but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> , but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances . ''
     While not as brand loyal as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> today do n't buy products capriciously , either .
     Rather , they tend to have a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> favorites .
     Sometimes , they 'll choose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ragu</ENAMEX> spaghetti <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sauce</ENAMEX> ; other times , it will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prego</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers</ENAMEX> attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands .
     If a more absorbent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pampers</ENAMEX> hits the market , you can be sure a new and improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Huggies</ENAMEX> wo n't be far behind .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BBDO Worldwide</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> studied `` brand parity '' and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories , particularly credit cards , paper towels , dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soups</ENAMEX> and snack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chips</ENAMEX> .
     `` When there 's a clutter of brands , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> simplify the complexity by telling themselves , ` All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy , ' '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Olshan</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BBDO </ENAMEX>.
     `` Too often , advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> . ''
     But given such strong brand disloyalty , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX> are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising .
     A small but growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs , magazines and membership <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clubs</ENAMEX> for brand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> .
     While discount promotions are essential for most brands , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons , refunds and other sales incentives .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> spent on advertising through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the years</TIMEX> .
     But most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are too afraid to take that chance .
     And perhaps with good reason .
     Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayt Wilhite</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">D'Arcy Masius</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , `` Every time <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Budweiser</ENAMEX> . ''
     Consider , for example , what happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> brand stopped advertising for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
     But since returning to advertising , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Folgers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kraft General Foods </ENAMEX>' parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> -RCB- is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Mayer </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Foods USA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     `` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> , for one , has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> than on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who buy competitive brands .
     `` The probability of converting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-user</ENAMEX> to your brand is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Adams</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for marketing research .
     `` The best odds are with your core franchise .
     Our heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> consume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cans of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soup</ENAMEX> a week , and we 'd like to increase that . ''
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> is talking to its `` brand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> , '' probing their psychological attachment to its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soup</ENAMEX> .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> declared that , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soup</ENAMEX> is like getting a hug from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> . ''
     That helped persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to introduce a new advertising slogan : `` A warm hug from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> 's . ''

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> face the prospect of paying out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> for damages caused by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> faced after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> ripped through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     The earthquake 's toll , including possible deep structural damage , goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Reider</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> 's claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake , coming so soon after the hurricane , will help stem <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than two years</TIMEX> of intense price-cutting wars among business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> .
     Reflecting that logic , insurance-company stocks posted strong gains .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> are hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> to help them assess structural damage .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> already have mobilized their `` catastrophe '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to begin processing claims from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policyholders</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     Since commercial air travel is interrupted , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , chartered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> to fly claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and then planned for them to drive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> were dispatched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> , already in other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , drove to the disaster area with recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicles</ENAMEX> and mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> that could be used as makeshift claims-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> will be advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO:PHONE">800</ENAMEX> numbers -- probably on the radio -- that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policyholders</ENAMEX> can call to get assistance on how to submit claims .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $ 475 million</NUMEX> in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bloomington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> , is also the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">writer</ENAMEX> of personal-property earthquake insurance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">California</ENAMEX> .
     Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement `` rider '' on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowner</ENAMEX> 's policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> , because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 %</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policyholders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> have also purchased earthquake insurance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allstate Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sears , Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> , said <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 23 %</NUMEX> of its personal property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policyholders</ENAMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 28 %</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Franciso</ENAMEX> area -- also have earthquake coverage .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Association of California Insurance Companies</ENAMEX> estimated damage to residential property could total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> , but <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 100 million to $ 150 million</NUMEX> is insured , it said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Insurance Association</ENAMEX> 's property-claim service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , which coordinates the efforts of the claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> in an area after a natural disaster , will be flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> today .
     They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Highways</ENAMEX> , such as the section of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate 880</ENAMEX> that collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> , generally do n't have insurance coverage .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> -- unlike some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridges</ENAMEX> -- has no earthquake coverage , either , so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> , which charges a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 toll</NUMEX> each way , does have `` loss of income '' insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">bridge</ENAMEX> is interrupted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than seven days</TIMEX> .
     That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Novato</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
     Earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole .
     Instead , even with the liabilities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> natural disasters in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> than it was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midyear</TIMEX> .
     Indeed , the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy .
     Such increased demand for reinsurance , along with the losses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">reinsurers</ENAMEX> will bear from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disasters , are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise .
     Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> themselves .
     `` We are saying this is the breaking point , this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Yankus</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conning & Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> that specializes in the insurance industry .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , along with some others , issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Among the insurance stocks , big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">gainers</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American International Group</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 102.625</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Re Corp.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 86.50</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.375</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 59.50</NUMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marsh & McLennan Inc.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.125</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75.875</NUMEX> .
     Still , a few individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , most likely smaller ones , could be devastated .
     `` I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Picoult</ENAMEX> .
     He suspects some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> and other overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> are bracing for big claims from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake disaster .
     Although it 's unclear how much exposure the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market will face , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> catastrophe coverage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Byrne </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's Fund</ENAMEX> , said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market , causing these rates to soar .
     The catastrophe losses sustained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> -- when another earthquake sparked the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Great San Francisco Fire</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orin Kramer</ENAMEX> , an insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , estimates that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> destruction , on an inflation-adjusted basis , included insured losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     He is estimating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's disaster will generate insured losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion to $ 4 billion</NUMEX> , following <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 4 billion</NUMEX> in costs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .

     He said the tie-up would mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> could `` develop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> down range -LCB- in price -RCB- from where we are '' by offering access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's high-volume parts production .
     Besides creating joint manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ventures</ENAMEX> , the accord is expected to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> about a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stake that eventually would rise to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> figures a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> will fend off unwelcome advances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co .</ENAMEX>
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> since lifting its stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , is pressing harder for talks with Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John </ENAMEX>.
     `` We 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet '' with him , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon , he added .
     Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> has spurned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's advances since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> launched a surprise bid for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 15 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later .
     `` I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> asserted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     He did n't rule out negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , however .
     The fiercely proud but financially strapped <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> prefers to remain independent and publicly held , despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how .
     Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">supplier</ENAMEX> , agrees `` we should remain an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> started negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> and several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , but the rest `` dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 4</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.30</NUMEX> -RRB- a share . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares stood at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">405 pence</NUMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's initial announcement , but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up .
     The stock traded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's stock exchange at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">673 pence</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 pence</NUMEX> .
     Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">luxury-car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> .
     A typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> is mass produced and smaller than a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .
     It generally fetches <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">no more than # 25,000</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 39,400</NUMEX> -RRB- -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly # 16,000</NUMEX> less than the highest-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguars</ENAMEX> , which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work .
     `` We have designs for such -LCB- executive -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , but have never been able to develop them , '' Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's help would `` make it possible -LCB- for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> -RCB- to build a wider range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> . ''
     An executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> would significantly boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">yearly</TIMEX> output of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     `` You are talking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a couple hundred thousand</NUMEX> a year , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Barber</ENAMEX> , an auto-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel & Co .</ENAMEX>
     A pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> may emerge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as little as two weeks</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> close to the talks .
     The deal would require approval by a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have to make it attractive enough that -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> -RCB- would accept it , '' Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> said .
     That may be difficult , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> acknowledged , `` when you have somebody else breathing down your neck .
     '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> takeover-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> and holding out the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">carrot</ENAMEX> of a larger bid later , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UBS Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> ca n't make a full-fledged bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> restrictions expire .
     The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> from buying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 15 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares without permission until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 31 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     But with its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.4 %</NUMEX> stake , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> can convene a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely .
     `` It 's a very valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapon</ENAMEX> in their armory , '' which could enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to bid sooner for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> , observed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">James Capel</ENAMEX> .
     Otherwise , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> may have to tolerate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> each owning a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> stake for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than a year</TIMEX> .
     `` It would be difficult to see how a car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can be owned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">collective</ENAMEX> , '' Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ameritech Corp.</ENAMEX> 's earnings increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 %</NUMEX> , after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Midwest</ENAMEX> territory .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</NUMEX> as a result of debt refinancing , the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">property</ENAMEX> and rate reductions in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Southeast</ENAMEX> territory .

     They accounted for a hefty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> busiest session ever .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> of volume was in computer-guided program trades .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , by contrast , program trading averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.3 %</NUMEX> of daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> turnover .
     Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were publicly castigated following the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX>-point crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , and a number of brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> pulled back from using this strategy for a while .
     But as the outcry faded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the spring of 1988</TIMEX> , they resumed .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> thought that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's sharp drop , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> would rein in their program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to avoid stoking more controversy .
     But the statistics released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> did nothing of the sort .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason , they said , was that the official reports on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash exonerated program trading as a cause .
     Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves , if not actually causing them .
     In it , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies .
     Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's definitions , program trading also describes a number of other strategies that , in the opinion of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , do n't cause big swings in the market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's disclosure of program trading activity on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these two days</TIMEX> was unusual .
     Though it collects such data <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> , its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> reports on program trading usually come out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">about three weeks</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each month</TIMEX> ends .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> figures are due to be released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> declined to name the Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> involved in the activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , or the type of strategies used .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> floor , who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens , said most of the top program-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> were active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">both days</TIMEX> .
     Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in volume were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Though brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> defended their use of program trading , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sign of what an issue it remains was that few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> would comment on the record .
     Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report , they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to restore the markets ' equilibrium .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 futures contract -- a `` circuit breaker '' procedure instituted after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash and implemented for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time .
     Futures trading resumed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half-hour later</TIMEX> , but the session ended shortly thereafter , leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> , they said , stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures .
     But stunning volatility was produced in the process .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63.52</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 40 minutes</TIMEX> of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:10 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> , the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> 's end , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials had rebounded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's drop .

     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National</ENAMEX> posted a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 136.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.90</NUMEX> a share .
     It had profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.46</NUMEX> a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> period .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National</ENAMEX> had been paying a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> dividend of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> real estate market continues to be depressed , and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Simmons</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , said .
     The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is `` both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National</ENAMEX> said it made the decision on the basis of an `` overall assessment of the marketplace '' and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> .
     The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 199.7 million</NUMEX> that was announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's</ENAMEX> downgraded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 400 million</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's debt , saying the bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX> write-down .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard M. Greenwood</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , said then that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> believed the write-downs were `` adequate '' and did n't plan to increase its reserves again .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Hoyt</ENAMEX> , a banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boettcher & Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valley National</ENAMEX> `` is n't out of the woods yet . ''
     The key will be whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> real estate turns around or at least stabilizes , he said .
     `` They 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs , but when markets head down , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is always exposed to further negative surprises , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoyt</ENAMEX> said .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Two years</TIMEX> of coddling , down the drain .
     That 's the way a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> feel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> anniversary of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> stock-market crash .
     Ever since that fearful <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> , they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -- trying to convince them that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19 , 1987</TIMEX> , was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to put their hard-earned dollars .
     And until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off .
     `` Some of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> were coming back , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Quick Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , of discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quick & Reilly Group Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` We had heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had n't been active '' for a long time .
     Then came the frightening <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility .
     All of a sudden , it was back to square <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> .
     `` It 's going to set things back for a period , because it reinforces the concern of volatility , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey B. Lane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` I think it will shake confidence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more time , and a lot of this business is based on client confidence . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> say the reaction from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> has been almost eerie .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     `` The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond A. `` Chip '' Mason</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of regional brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legg Mason Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
     `` I can just tell the questions are right back where they were : ` What 's going on ? , ' ` Ca n't anything be done about program trading ? , ' ` Does n't the exchange understand ? , ' ` Where is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> on this ? ' ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> says he 's convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> still wants to invest in common stocks , even though they believe the deck is stacked against them .
     But `` these wide swings scare them to death . ''
     All of this is bad news for the big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> that have big `` retail , '' or individual-investor , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     After expanding rapidly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the bull-market years</TIMEX> up to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash , retail brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead .
     True , the amount of money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are willing to entrust to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> has been growing lately .
     But those dollars have been going into such `` safe '' products as money market funds , which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     At discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Schwab & Co.</ENAMEX> , such `` cash-equivalent '' investments recently accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 8 billion</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 billion</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> 's assets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> ' hope has been that they could soon coax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market .
     And before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> , they were actually making modest progress .
     A slightly higher percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume has been attributed to retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> compared with post-crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX> data .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , an average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.7 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume was retail business , with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> level never <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 21.4 %</NUMEX> .
     The retail participation dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 18.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , and shriveled to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">barely 14 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some months</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     Yet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> , retail participation has been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every month</TIMEX> , and was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest month</TIMEX> for which figures are available .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Schaefer</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SIA</ENAMEX> 's research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , says that all of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as five</NUMEX> percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> data .
     But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup .
     But `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> did n't help things , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schaefer</ENAMEX> .
     With the gyrations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent days</TIMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Quackenbush</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Charles Schwab </ENAMEX>, many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Grano</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of retail sales and marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , still thinks that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will eventually go back into the stock market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge , he is telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , was nothing more than a `` tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks . ''
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> remains among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in efforts to simply persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to keep giving Wall Street their money .
     `` It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets , rather than push the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> to move into -LRB- specific -RRB- products such as equities , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grano</ENAMEX> says .
     `` The equity decision will come when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence . ''
     It could be a long wait , say some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> will tiptoe back in , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ross</ENAMEX> , a market research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Elrick & Lavidge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     `` Then there 'll be another swing .
     Given enough of these , this will drive everyone out except the most hardy , '' he adds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> , who has been studying retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry , said a market plunge like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's `` shatters <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market . ''
     The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is `` miserable , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> declares .

     As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX> was also appointed for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> venture-capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> was the subject of a page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> profile in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> questioned him about ties between him and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> he touted in a newsletter .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , in another consent agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws .
     Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes </ENAMEX>, that agreement settled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> charges that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> sold unregistered securities and misled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     In charges filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> in federal district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture Capitalists Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Venture Finance Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Ventures Fund Inc.</ENAMEX> , all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Charlotte</ENAMEX> , failed repeatedly to file proper documents .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SEC</ENAMEX> also charged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> acted as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Ventures</ENAMEX> , in violation of his previous consent agreement .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> proposal , said he intends to unveil the plan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along , particularly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit .
     He gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill .
     He added that he expects to talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan would exclude from income <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than one year</TIMEX> .
     The exclusion would rise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percentage points for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> the asset was held until it reached a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> .
     The exclusion would apply to assets sold after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 1 , 1989</TIMEX> .
     As an alternative , he said , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than three years</TIMEX> would be cut to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> from the current top rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> .
     That rate would gradually decline to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as little as 29 %</NUMEX> for corporate assets held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">15 years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan would also include a proposal , designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roth</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home and to pay education and medical expenses .
     Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax .
     For their part , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are working on a plan that , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> proposal , would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held .
     An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> just starting up .
     No one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> .
     That plan would provide a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> exclusion to assets sold over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2 1\/2-year</TIMEX> period ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 31 , 1991</TIMEX> .
     After then , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> measure would boost the tax rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill .</ENAMEX> -RRB- of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
     The current debt limit expires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> .
     He also urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-passed capital-gains provision .

     From a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopter</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a thousand feet</NUMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-deadliest earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> history , a scene of devastation emerges : a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> crumbled into a concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sandwich</ENAMEX> , hoses pumping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> into once-fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments</ENAMEX> , abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> .
     But this quake was n't the big one , the replay of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> that has been feared for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">so many years</TIMEX> .
     Despite the tragic loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 270</NUMEX> lives , and damage estimated in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> were n't greatly affected .
     The economic life of the region is expected to revive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , although some transportation problems may last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> .
     A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">20 miles</NUMEX> from the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">more than 50 miles</NUMEX> from downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> .
     Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage .
     The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks .
     Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's capital of high technology .
     Like other major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .
     When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael L. Bandler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for network technology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Bell Telephone Co.</ENAMEX> , says nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> lost power .
     The battery packs have enough power for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only three hours</TIMEX> , but that gave emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fuel</ENAMEX> .
     Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 160</NUMEX> switches in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Bell</ENAMEX> 's network , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> went down .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollister</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , near the earthquake 's epicenter .
     Few telephone lines snapped .
     That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">25 extra feet</NUMEX> of cable between junction points .
     The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake .
     Nevertheless , phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> remained without power .
     Business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> stayed at home .
     The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself , as virtually all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> shut down .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125-billion</NUMEX>-a-year <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> economy represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fourth</NUMEX> of the economy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's most populous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> and accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % to 3 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's total output of goods and services , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> .
     In high-tech , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> computer-related industry .
     `` This has been a major disruption for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> economy , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline Sweezey</ENAMEX> , the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">California Department of Finance</ENAMEX> .
     `` Obviously , things are going to have to go on hold for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> . ''
     The damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadways</ENAMEX> could cause significant economic hardship .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter of a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> , far more than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> that use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> system -LRB- BART -RRB- -- which was working but was n't stopping in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Financial District</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> state transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> .
     All major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadways</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate 880</ENAMEX> , known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> were open by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     The earthquake caused many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> to buckle and crack , making them impassible .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> were obstructed by collapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> and damaged water and power lines , an emergency relief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX> estimated the damage to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> alone at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived .
     Of the scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> contacted by this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> , few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have remedied within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     It is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> could n't be reached , particularly in areas nearest the epicenter .
     Typical , perhaps , was the situation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> joint-venture auto <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fremont </ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about 35 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were injured when the quake hit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a half-hour</TIMEX> into the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> shift ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> were hospitalized .
     Metal racks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> was evacuated and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> sent home .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> was able to resume limited production of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Corollas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Geo Prizms</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , and absenteeism was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 7 %</NUMEX> of the work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> , about twice normal .
     Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> , says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> had broken glass , dangling light fixtures and broken pipes , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX> says , estimating the cost of reconstruction `` in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> . ''
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> were closed but were expected to reopen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> with few problems anticipated .
     At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Fienberg</ENAMEX> says operations were `` steaming along as usual '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .
     ` When the quake hit , we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fed</ENAMEX> serves as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">middleman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , taking checks from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and sending them to another , an operation that it handled smoothly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> after the quake .
     `` The volume we received from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> was a lot lower than usual , '' he says .
     A disaster-contingency plan in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Los Angeles Fed</ENAMEX> would come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's aid was n't needed , he adds .
     Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion .
     The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seeking to make a call at the same time .
     The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">as short as 15 seconds</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">as long as five minutes</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bandler</ENAMEX> puts traffic volume at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 50</NUMEX> times normal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Telecommunications</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U S Sprint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> were blocking phone calls into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> to alleviate congestion .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> block traffic much as highway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">on-ramps</ENAMEX> are blocked when traffic backs up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Downing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Bell</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of customer services for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> , says most long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> were blocking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> of all calls .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Telesis</ENAMEX> says its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> also was blocking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</NUMEX> of its calls locally .
     Ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's gross national product .
     It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highways</ENAMEX> .
     `` It would in the near-term give a boost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> economy because there will be an influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to help , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beth Burnham Mace</ENAMEX> , a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DRI\/McGraw Hill</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand .
     `` There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state , federal and local employment , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mace</ENAMEX> says .
     Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stacy Kotman</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia State University</ENAMEX> , `` There 's nothing positive about an earthquake , but it will probably generate more construction activity . ''
     Wall Street reacted swiftly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lone Star Industries Inc</ENAMEX>. , a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cement</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lone Star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael London</ENAMEX> says , `` Obviously with an earthquake of this size , there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated .
     But any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge .
     It 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time .
     There will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cement</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">concrete</ENAMEX> that new constructon would . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lone Star</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> were n't damaged in the quake .
     The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins .
     The first effects are , of course , negative as work is disrupted and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lose income and cut spending .
     Corporate profits may also dip initially .
     Many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered ; many trips delayed never take place .
     Subsequently , however , the ill effects are likely to be offset , at least in economic terms , as construction activity begins .
     Because of the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> keeps its books , the damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> , however costly , wo n't be counted as a minus .
     The money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus .
     `` It 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Goldberg </ENAMEX>, who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Center for Strategic International Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C .</ENAMEX>
     `` You certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe .
     We really are talking about shutting down a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a number of days</TIMEX> , maybe for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few weeks</TIMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> and could reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> .
     He cautions that early damage estimates are often low ; the damage totals in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> increased tenfold as more information was received .
     The earthquake damage , of course , would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     A direct hit on a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> figures , would cause <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 billion to $ 40 billion</NUMEX> of damage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage , but it 's clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> are likely to pay out enormous sums .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Byrne </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fireman 's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> , which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Novato</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     The impact on the insurance industry `` will be big and harsh , but less than -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane -RCB- Hugo</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrne </ENAMEX>, who toured the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> to get a sense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's exposure to the earthquake .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrne</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Fireman 's Fund</ENAMEX> will probably pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions</NUMEX> in primary claims , but , after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourthquarter</TIMEX> charge against earnings should n't top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> showing the exact locations of all the property it insures .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Fireman 's Fund</ENAMEX> had claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjusters</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> right after sunrise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Fireman 's Fund</ENAMEX> insures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> .
     In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> being shut down by lack of power or phone service .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Independent Insurance Agents of America</ENAMEX> says fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> has earthquake insurance .
     A somewhat higher percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay area</ENAMEX> have bought the additional insurance protection , but the great majority are n't covered .
     Earthquake insurance typically runs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200</NUMEX> or more a year for a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> .
     Whatever the long-term economic effect , the scene from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopter</ENAMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> is one of tragedy .
     Gargantuan sections of a double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> have been heaved about like plastic building blocks .
     Atop them sit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> before .
     In areas where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">freeway</ENAMEX> made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs .
     On the periphery , rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> seem , from the air , to move in slow motion .
     They peck away at the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">1 1\/2-mile</NUMEX> section of rubble , searching for more of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought to have died here .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 20</NUMEX> other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake .
     The heart of the earthquake , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> on the Richter scale , was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">50 miles</NUMEX> to the south , near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> , but its terrible fist struck here on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Nimitz Freeway</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">artery</ENAMEX> serving the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     Along the way , the quake toppled a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> , knocked down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina District</ENAMEX> and sent a wall of bricks crashing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Financial District</ENAMEX> .
     Just a short span across the bay to the west , the quake also showed its mettle : A four-square-block area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina District</ENAMEX> lies smoldering under a steady stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seawater</ENAMEX> being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew .
     Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> , mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">condominiums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">apartments</ENAMEX> , were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking , rupturing gas lines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Onlookers</ENAMEX> say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> died when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck .
     Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well .
     From the air , ribbons of yellow fire hose carry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onlookers</ENAMEX> stand behind barricades , helmeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firemen</ENAMEX> and building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> survey rows of nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina District</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> assessing damage , cleaning up and trying to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Boccone</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">85 years old</TIMEX> , has lived in the district most of her life .
     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> lost everything in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1906</TIMEX> earthquake .
     `` Now , we realize what our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> must have gone through , '' she says .
     `` We always heard about the earthquake , but as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> we did n't always listen .

     Bond prices rambled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Early yesterday</TIMEX> , bonds rose as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> rushed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     For example , some securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> warned that stocks of certain insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , which face massive damage claims , would get hit hard .
     But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead , bonds drifted lower .
     With stocks not a major focus , `` we 're waiting for the next guiding light , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian J. Fabbri</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Midland Montagu Securities Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` If the stock market tremors are behind us , then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine '' where interest rates are heading .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond , which jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3.75</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount , during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX> of trading , ended little changed .
     Interest rates barely budged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's levels .
     Most junk bonds , which have been battered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> , continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
     But some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Holdings Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.7 %</NUMEX> bonds due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2009</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point .

     In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , slashed the size of its note offering from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</NUMEX> .
     The move had been widely expected .

     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> that it will sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX> is the financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , a new government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> created to rescue the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     Its securities have been dubbed `` bailout bonds '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     In when-issued trading , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> Treasurys had a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.88 %</NUMEX> .
     In the municipal market , all eyes were on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> debt as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> tried to gauge the financial ramifications of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> state and local municipal debt .
     `` There are certain bonds <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> refer to as ` earthquake ' bonds because the -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> -RRB- are on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Andreas</ENAMEX> fault , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zane Mann</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Municipal Bond Advisor</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newsletter</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n't materially affected .
     But some bond market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims .
     `` Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lieberman</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .</ENAMEX>
     He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     A report issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> concluded the quake wo n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> and debt issues in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> area of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> affected by the quake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond ended at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 29\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.03 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 28\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes were quoted late at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 26\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 25\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.01 %</NUMEX> .
     Short-term rates were little changed .
     Corporate Issues
     Investment-grade corporate bonds ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> point lower .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> junk bond offering , underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , was the only new issue priced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-part offering , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</NUMEX> of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.75 % to 15.75 %</NUMEX> .
     Municipals
     Municipal bonds ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/8 to 3\/8</NUMEX> point lower , hurt by the circulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> `` bid-wanted '' lists totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 655 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> is acting as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agent</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> issues were down a touch more than the broad market , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said there had n't been much <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> selling because of the quake .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> general obligation bonds came under selling pressure .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , pushing yields for longer maturities up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> percentage point .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were reacting to recent negative news on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's finances and are nervous ahead of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 7 election</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">D.C.</ENAMEX> , topped the competitive slate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> with a sale of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes .
     In late trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">New Jersey Turnpike Authority</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.20 %</NUMEX> issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2018</TIMEX> was off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> point at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> bid .
     The yield was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.35 %</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> percentage point .
     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings .
     There was no appreciable market impact from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said there was some concern that insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims , but no selling materialized .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> of mortgage securities , have a sizable amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> home loans in their mortgagebacked pools .
     But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase .
     And because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northern California</ENAMEX> home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large to be included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> pools .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 29\/32</NUMEX> , unchanged .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 4\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/32</NUMEX> .
     In derivative markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> issued <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two $ 400 million</NUMEX> real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities .
     Foreign Bonds
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government bonds , or gilts , ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's drop .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3\/4 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2003\/2007</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11\/32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 31\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.08 %</NUMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 22\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.04 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> may be an anxious day for the market .
     Several key economic figures are due out and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> is scheduled to give the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Mansion House</ENAMEX> '' address to the financial community .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX> sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> do n't expect any such changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's address , given Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> government bonds retreated in quiet trading , stymied by the dollar 's resiliency .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's bellwether <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> ended on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> ' screens at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.75</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.315 %</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> issue due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.90</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.01 %</NUMEX> .
