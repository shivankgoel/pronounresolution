     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> conditionally approved proposed exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> from big , untapped fields in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mackenzie River delta</ENAMEX> area of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Canadian Arctic</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Esso Resources Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX> , applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Canadian National Energy Board</ENAMEX> to export <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">9.2 trillion cubic feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mackenzie delta</ENAMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1996</TIMEX> .
     To be economically feasible , the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 billion Canadian dollar</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 9.37 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices .
     It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> interests would also be allowed to bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mackenzie delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> on terms similar to those offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> have already been lined up .

     The project could result in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> taking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> of its natural gas supplies from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> currently .
     It would bring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> gas fields into production at a combined rate of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">about 1.2 billion cubic feet</NUMEX> a day .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> estimated that the cost of building a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">pipeline</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Mackenzie delta</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alberta</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about C$ 5.9 million</NUMEX> .
     It also said projections of surging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand for natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gas</ENAMEX> and price forecasts of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 5.25</NUMEX> per thousand cubic feet by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2005</TIMEX> would make the project economically viable .

     Where do <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> put their money ?
     It depends on when you look .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1900</TIMEX> , for instance , less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> of assets went into bank deposits .
     That rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 18 %</NUMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Depression</ENAMEX> , and has n't changed much since .
     Pension reserves , on the other hand , made up a relatively small part of household assets until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> , when they skyrocketed .
     And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farms</ENAMEX> .
     That 's some of what emerges from the following charts , which show how <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have changed their investment patterns over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 90 years</TIMEX> .
     Some results are self-explanatory .
     But other figures are surprising .
     Housing , for instance , has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> -- although common wisdom would have expected an increase .
     `` There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward N. Wolff </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of economics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">New York University</ENAMEX> .
     `` But it has n't increased much relative to other assets .
     It suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets .
     And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major -LCB- growing -RCB- household asset , is n't . ''
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady ; stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market , and not a shift in stock-holding preferences .
     `` Stocks have not spread to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> , despite the fact that the environment is much different , '' concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Avery</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Cornell University</ENAMEX> .
     `` To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets , we have ways of holding wealth similar to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">100 years ago</TIMEX> . ''
     -- The charts show how househld assets have been distributed over time .
     The main components of the various asseet categories : Housing : Primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , but not the land it 's on .
     Land and Other Real Estate : Land on which primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> is built , investment property .
     Consumer Durables : <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Automobiles</ENAMEX> , appliances , furniture .
     Bank Deposits : Currency , checking-account deposits , small savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , money-market fund shares .
     Bonds : Excludes bond funds .
     Stocks\/Mutual Funds : Stocks and mutual funds other than money-market funds .
     Unincorporated Business : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Partnerships</ENAMEX> and sole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">proprietorships</ENAMEX> , professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> is seeking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.3 %</NUMEX> of the cellular and broadcasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> ; the revised offer includes a feature requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> to begin an auction process in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1994</TIMEX> that would buy out remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> might then have to pay for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> .
     The letter outlines broad powers for an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> provided for in the revised offer .
     In a statement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig O. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX></ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> , said : `` We trust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> will take no further actions that favor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BellSouth</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> said the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> provided for in the offer would be designated by the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> would be nominated by the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> cellular interests in markets other than those in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw </ENAMEX>holds an interest , or which are contiguous to those markets , unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> has an interest there or contiguous to it .
     Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> 's best interest .
     Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> at the time it is to be sold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years</TIMEX> .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LIN</ENAMEX> is put up for sale rather than purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McCaw</ENAMEX> wo n't submit a bid unless the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> request it , and the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> will run the bidding .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> would be able to sell particular assets to enable such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> as the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bell</ENAMEX> operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's interests .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> plans to close its company-owned insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> and is seeking other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> to take over its policies , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley Enterprises</ENAMEX> is the umbrella <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry B. Helmsley</ENAMEX> .
     These include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> and residential real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HelmsleySpear Inc.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley Hotels</ENAMEX> .
     The insurance brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , just a fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> , would be the first piece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to be stripped away since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX> , was found guilty of tax evasion .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> estimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> brokers property and casualty premiums worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 25 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> , and has revenue , based on a standard <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> commission rate , of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.5 million</NUMEX> .
     The insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> acts as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broker</ENAMEX> on policies covering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> managed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">HelmsleySpear</ENAMEX> and others .
     Many of the properties are owned through limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> controlled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmsley</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York State</ENAMEX> law prohibits insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokerages</ENAMEX> from deriving <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> of revenue from insuring affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> had slightly exceeded that percentage , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> say , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> was n't considered significant enough to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to be restructured , particularly at a difficult time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and related management strife have put pressure on the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> insist shuttering the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , a sideline from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's core property management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , is n't the beginning of a sale of assets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley</ENAMEX> 's insurance premiums are expected to be transferred to several different insurance brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Frank B. Hall Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Briarcliff Manor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> is reportedly working out an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley </ENAMEX>.
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> there declined to comment , as did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Helmsley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> .

     Outside the white-walled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the socalled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Society of Orange Workers</ENAMEX> , all seems normal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> .
     A pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> driven by a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> rumbles past with a load of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> bouncing in the back .
     Over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conradies</ENAMEX> , the general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> , a black stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> scurries to help an elderly white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with her packages .
     Down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> pulls into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> and is surrounded by black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> .
     But inside the white walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">office</ENAMEX> -- just about the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> , save for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Dutch Reformed Church</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's neat racial order is awry .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A dozen</NUMEX> white office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes .
     White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> serve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> , and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards .
     White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows .
     There is n't a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in sight .
     Not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">kitchen</ENAMEX> , or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">storeroom</ENAMEX> or the book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> .
     `` If we want to have our own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrik Verwoerd Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of the former prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> , founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> .
     They do indeed want their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Johannesburg</ENAMEX> opening its public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> storming the all-white beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Cape</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> releasing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the banned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">African National Congress</ENAMEX> .
     But here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morgenzon</ENAMEX> , a sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> amid the corn fields of the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Transvaal</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> are holding the pillars steady .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> -- who take their name from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William of Orange</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Netherlands</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>-descended <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaners</ENAMEX> -- believe that the solution to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid , it 's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> .
     Here , then , is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> have come to make apartheid 's last stand .
     Their idea is to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , and then an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> -- without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> .
     This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Africa</ENAMEX> .
     And the fact that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3,000</NUMEX> card-carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> may put them on the loony fringe .
     But their ideal of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">homeland</ENAMEX> , an all-white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">reserve</ENAMEX> to be carved out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> , is a mainstream desire of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-wing</ENAMEX> , which embraces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologians</ENAMEX> have long ruminated on the need for a white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">homeland</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> are just putting this preaching into practice .
     Thus , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johan Fischer</ENAMEX> , his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease , crawls around under his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planter</ENAMEX> , tightening bolts and fixing dents .
     On almost every other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">farm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> , black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> do the repairs .
     But not here .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX> plows his own fields , sows his own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sunflowers</ENAMEX> , and feeds his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> .
     Over at the fiberglass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> assemble water tanks on their own , and in their spare time they build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">townhouses</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> .
     On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Main Street</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alida Verwoerd</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> look after the clothes and fabric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shop</ENAMEX> , then hurry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> to fix lunch for the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> .
     Down by the stream , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> puts the finishing touches on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">golf course</ENAMEX> .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> want to play there by themselves , says consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willem van Heerden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> should also build it by themselves .
     `` If we want to survive as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' he says , `` we have to change our way of life .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaner</ENAMEX> must end his reliance on others . ''
     In their quest to perfect apartheid , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> have discovered a truth that most of privileged white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> tries mightily to deny : The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> ca n't become dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> and expect to remain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> forever .
     `` If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it , but you also want to exclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> from social and political integration , then these are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verwoerd</ENAMEX> .
     He is sitting in his living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , beneath a huge portrait of his late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrik F. Verwoerd</ENAMEX> , apartheid 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1958</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1966</TIMEX> .
     Somewhere , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> sighs , things went terribly wrong with apartheid ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> even rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> to police their separation .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it .
     But my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> meant it to mean real separation , '' says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> speak sincerely .
     `` We agree with world opinion that the status quo in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> is morally wrong , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter Bruwer</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> ' chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pamphleteer</ENAMEX> .
     `` We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morgenzon</ENAMEX> has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom .
     According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verwoerd</ENAMEX> , the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to settle in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Transvaal</ENAMEX> , even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> .
     Then , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morgenzon</ENAMEX> was incorporated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1908</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> who owned the land stipulated that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> could reside in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> could work there , but they had to leave at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morgenzon</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Weeds</ENAMEX> push up through the cracks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">sidewalks</ENAMEX> , and many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">storefronts</ENAMEX> are empty .
     There are few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> and no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mines</ENAMEX> .
     It was an ideal place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> to start their new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> .
     So far , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> have moved here , spending nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> buying up property over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past three years</TIMEX> .
     Still , complete and total segregation remains elusive .
     Just beyond the city limits is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">shantytown</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> who are employed throughout the area .
     Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> ' intention to put them all out of work , they are in no hurry to leave .
     A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">July</ENAMEX> -LRB- that 's when he was born -RRB- , who works at the railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">station</ENAMEX> just up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">office</ENAMEX> , points at the whitewalled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> and says matter-of-factly , `` We 're not allowed in there , that 's all I know . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650-or-so</NUMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> who are n't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> are more troubled .
     Try as they might , they just ca n't conceive of life without black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Impossible , impossible , '' say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conradies</ENAMEX> , an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> who have run the general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> .
     `` We ca n't do without their help , '' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conradie</ENAMEX> .
     `` Oh no .
     We need them and I thank God for them . ''
     Over at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">station</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudi van Dyk </ENAMEX>, who doubles as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morgenzon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , worries that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> have made his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> the laughingstock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> .
     `` What they want us to do just is n't practical , '' he says , noting that he employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> .
     `` I could n't afford to hire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> .

     Back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verwoerd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrik Sr.</ENAMEX> peers down over the shoulder of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrik Jr .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> believes that when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaners</ENAMEX> finally realize there is no turning back the integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> society and politics , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Morgenzon</ENAMEX> will boom .
     `` We urge our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not to wait until they have to fight for their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verwoerd</ENAMEX> .
     `` By populating a place now , we make ourselves a power any new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will have to take into account . ''

     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">ANC</ENAMEX> wo n't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verwoerd</ENAMEX> .
     `` Likewise , no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will stop this idea of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Afrikaners</ENAMEX> . ''
     He apologizes for sounding pushy .
     `` Look , '' he says , `` If the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> wants to have an integrated melting pot , that 's their choice .

     Okay , now you can pick up that phone .
     But do n't do anything rash .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> 's stock-market plunge , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to resist the urge to call their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and sell stocks .
     Not selling into a panic turned out to be very good advice : Despite the market 's volatility , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past four days</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> , with a semblance of normalcy returning , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say it 's time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to take a hard , cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning .
     `` The market is sending nervous signals , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter J. Canelo</ENAMEX> , chief market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear , Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> , and it 's `` unwise '' to be overcommitted to stocks .

     And even those who say some selective selling may be in order stress that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets .
     Any selling , they say , should be well thought-out , and executed gradually , during market rallies .
     They offer these suggestions :
     GET RID OF THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">DOGS</ENAMEX> .
     `` Sell stocks that are n't doing well now , and that do n't have good earnings prospects , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Goldman</ENAMEX> , technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.G. Edwards & Sons</ENAMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do just the opposite : They sell their winners and keep their losers . ''
     Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify ?
     Technology stocks , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldman </ENAMEX>.
     WATCH FOR EARNINGS DISAPPOINTMENTS .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles I. Clough Jr.</ENAMEX> , chief market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch & Co .</ENAMEX>
     If earnings do n't live up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' expectations , he says , that 's enough to dump the stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Markese</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Association of Individual Investors</ENAMEX> , raises a cautionary note .
     `` Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment '' can be a mistake , he says .
     An earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clough</ENAMEX> says , `` The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue . ''
     The economy is decelerating after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six good years</TIMEX> , and `` right now it 's better to shoot <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and ask questions later . ''
     Which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks ?
     Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ; commodity cyclical stocks , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">autos</ENAMEX> ; and retailing stocks , he says .
     BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Biehl</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Mateo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , money-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bailard , Biehl & Kaiser</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canelo</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> agrees : `` If we do have an economic slowdown , '' he says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse . ''
     The best course for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> is to sell these stocks now , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say .
     SELL ` WHISPER ' STOCKS .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to `` takeover stocks , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canelo</ENAMEX> .
     Takeover activity will slow down as more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> tighten their lending requirements , he says .
     `` There 'll be fewer and fewer deals . ''
     Moreover , many financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> should be in the stock market as long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , not as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> trying to catch the next hot stock .
     In general , they say , avoid takeover stocks .
     COMPARE P\/E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canelo</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> compare price\/earnings ratios -LRB- the price of a share of stock divided by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's per-share earnings for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-month</TIMEX> period -RRB- with projected growth rates .
     `` If you think earnings will grow at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> a year , it 's all right to pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> times earnings , '' he says .
     `` But do n't pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> times earnings for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that 's expected to grow at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> a year . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canelo</ENAMEX> thinks the market will probably go higher , but `` will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markese</ENAMEX> cautions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger .
     `` If you say sell anytime a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> , that knocks out all your growth stocks , '' he says .
     `` You eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with substantial prospects that are moving up in price . ''
     EXAMINE WHAT HAS CHANGED .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Schlesinger</ENAMEX> , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> since they bought its stock .
     Say you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works .
     Now , because of various difficulties , the product has been scrapped .
     Time to sell , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlesinger</ENAMEX> .
     Similarly , he says , suppose you were attracted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> because of expectations that sales would hit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     If things have n't worked out that well , and sales wo n't hit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , it 's time to consider selling , he says .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX> reported a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> jump in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings , as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans , higher interest margins and negligible loan losses .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> said it earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 254 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.16</NUMEX> a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">97 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesmen</ENAMEX> said preliminary reports indicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> was n't materially affected by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> earthquake .
     All but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> , which had some structural damage , reopened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> for business .
     Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , a bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">nearly two years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> results failed to improve in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">consecutive quarters</TIMEX> , but the decline from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> was attributable to special factors .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> profit was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 304 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> a share , earned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1989 second quarter</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> cited higher tax credits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 63 million</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Excluding tax credits , profit was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> interest paid , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 54 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170 million</NUMEX> , about the same as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter</TIMEX> but well above the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier quarter</TIMEX> .
     The provision rate was far above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> 's actual net credit losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 24 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second period</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans , once below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> , now amounts to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.4 billion</NUMEX> of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     That level is about the same as some other big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , but far below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> reserves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.P. Morgan & Co.</ENAMEX> , respectively .
     By any measure , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings were still robust , equivalent to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.92 %</NUMEX> return on assets even excluding tax credits .
     By that key measure of operating efficiency , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> turned in a better performance than its well-regarded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> , which posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.89 %</NUMEX> return in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     But it continued to badly trail its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">neighbor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wells Fargo & Co.</ENAMEX> , which reported an extraordinary <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.25 %</NUMEX> return on assets .
     Both returns do n't include any tax credits .
     `` They -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> -RCB- continue to show good performance , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald K. Crowley </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keefe , Bruyette & Woods Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     In composite trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> common stock edged up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 cents</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32</NUMEX> a share .
     Shareholder equity improved to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.68 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.23 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous quarter</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.52 %</NUMEX> net interest margin , or the difference between the yield on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings , was still markedly higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.91 %</NUMEX> ratio <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , and is among the best in the industry , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said .
     The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans , which jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.47 billion</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , and residential mortgages , which rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 12 billion</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> 's total loans rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71.36 billion</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> profit soared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 833 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.07</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 461 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.40</NUMEX> a share .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> will announce on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing operations , industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said .
     Many plant floors currently resemble a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Tower of Babel</ENAMEX> , with computers , robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other .
     As a result , if a problem develops on a production line , it is unlikely some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it .
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will be announcing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe , or anything in between .
     In an unusual display of openness , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> also will be helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad-hoc software , for instance , to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Armonk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> but declined to elaborate .
     The industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said that , as usual with such broad announcements from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , this one will be part reality and part strategy .
     So it will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many quarters</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> to roll out all the products that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> need , and it will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> to integrate the products into their operations .
     Also as usual , the products will appeal mostly to heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> equipment , at least initially .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient , and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market -- a market that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Yankee Group</ENAMEX> , a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">firm</ENAMEX> , has said may double to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 billion</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> .
     `` This is a step in the right direction , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Piszczalski</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Yankee Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> .
     He added , though , that `` a lot of this is intentions ... .
     We 'll have to wait and see '' how the plan develops .
     The announcements also should help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> go on the offensive against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> on the plant floor .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> has dominated computerized manufacturing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will face an uphill climb against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital </ENAMEX>, given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> 's reputation for being better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> at hooking together different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' computers .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard </ENAMEX>, while a much smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> , has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> some problems .
     Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Gartner Group Inc.</ENAMEX> , a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">firm</ENAMEX> , estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> gets <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of its revenue from the manufacturing market , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> gets <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gartner Group</ENAMEX> said generates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> of its revenue in this market , should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> of equipment .
     That is because many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> .
     But much will depend on how quickly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> can move .
     The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing , CIM , seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past couple of years</TIMEX> when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> more efficient and banish foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competition</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Keller</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Gartner Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM 's capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> using a personal computer to look over his shoulder , for instance , and may be able to prevent that from happening .
     But he said a system such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> 's should help significantly .
     In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips , for instance , a chip sometimes does n't melt , gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets .
     That can be expensive , because the problem may not be noticed for a while , and the sheets are typically thrown away .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> said that , if computers can be integrated into the process , they could alert an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> as soon as the problem occurred .
     They could also check through the orders on file to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> that was willing to accept a lower grade of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> .
     The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled , eliminating waste .
     This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapon</ENAMEX> for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Companies</ENAMEX> might be able to tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> , for instance , about idle equipment , so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Salespeople</ENAMEX> also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered -- in much the same way that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it will halt imports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpio</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 28,000</NUMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford of Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> are sold under a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> with its own sign in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln-Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> -- as opposed to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Taurus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Escort</ENAMEX> , which are sold under existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">divisions</ENAMEX> .
     The move to halt imports -- announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">29 years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">11 months to the day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ford II</ENAMEX> declared that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> and its gawky <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> would be scrapped -- kills the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">four-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brand</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market .
     It will continue to be sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> 's death is n't nearly as costly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> as was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edsel</ENAMEX> debacle , because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> was a relatively low-budget project with limited sales goals .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> 's demise is a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> at a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's image as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> with the golden touch is showing signs of strain .
     The No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Thunderbird</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Cougar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> have n't met sales expectations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the year since they were introduced</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> are losing ground to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">rivals</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This fall</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> introduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> new product : A restyled version of its hulking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Town Car</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> .
     The demise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> -LRB- pronounced mare-COOR -RRB- comes after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">670</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> managed to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpios</ENAMEX> .
     Total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 6,320</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> is n't the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brand</ENAMEX> having problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> makes as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Audi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saab</ENAMEX> , which at least have clear brand images .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> , as an import on domestic car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lots</ENAMEX> , suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> was originally aimed at enticing into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lincoln-Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealerships</ENAMEX> the kind of young , affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> who would n't be caught dead in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Town Car</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> so bargelike that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is staging a press event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Town Car</ENAMEX> 's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">carrier</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Norfolk</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Va .</ENAMEX>
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brand</ENAMEX> had trouble from the start .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> , went on sale in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1985</TIMEX> .
     The sporty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">coupe</ENAMEX> foundered in part because <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> did n't go for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> 's unusual double-wing rear spoiler .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> began importing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> to sell next to a redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">showrooms</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they expected the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkurs</ENAMEX> would sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> a year , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> they reached that goal , as sales hit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,261</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     It was downhill from there , however .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark , which began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">less than a year</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> launch .
     As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> currency rose , so did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> prices .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> also suffered from spotty quality , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> say .
     `` It was like a comedy of errors , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin J. `` Hoot '' McInerney</ENAMEX> , a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Star Lincoln-Mercury-Merkur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Southfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , sold more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> 's than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealership</ENAMEX> .
     But by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpios</ENAMEX> had a high satisfaction rating in internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> studies , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     Apparently , however , the improvement came too late .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last fall</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> announced it would discontinue the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">XR4Ti</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the 1989 model year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said then it would keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpio</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpio</ENAMEX> sales plummeted , and at the current sales pace it would take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> to sell off the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scorpio</ENAMEX> inventory of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soo Line</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> appointed a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> to study the proposal .
     The troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>-based railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> has the authority to hire financial and legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> to assist it .
     The proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Interstate Commerce Commission</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soo Line</ENAMEX> said .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> put its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soo Line</ENAMEX> up for sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> but could n't find any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">takers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> , which has interests in transportation , telecommunications , forest products , energy and real estate , finally took its majority block off the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this spring</TIMEX> .
     `` It turned out we could n't sell it , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said , adding that acquiring the remainder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Soo Line</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> `` the best way to rationalize operations .

     PLASTIC PENCILS , CODE-NAMED <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">E-71</ENAMEX> , made their hush-hush debut in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's pencil boxes at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-and-dime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> .
     But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eagle Pencil</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Shelbyville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pencil City U.S.A.</ENAMEX> , '' had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1971</TIMEX> .
     But it was n't until after it hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , that its new product was refined for commercial sale in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1973</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.D.L.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventors</ENAMEX> applied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 6 , 1973</TIMEX> , for the patent , which was assigned and awarded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1976</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hasbro Industries</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> .
     Pencil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pushers</ENAMEX> chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> incense <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> filled with ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">lead</ENAMEX> .
     It takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> steps to make standard pencils , just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for the plastic type .
     Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed , cut , painted and eraser-fitted .
     `` After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than 200 years</TIMEX> , something new has happened to pencils , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> report that publicly described the previously secret item .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil .
     A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly .
     The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-type pencils , which account for the bulk of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">draftsmen</ENAMEX> need harder `` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">leads</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> , now called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eagle-Berol</ENAMEX> , remains a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> that produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2.3 billion</NUMEX> pencils <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pencil Makers Association</ENAMEX> .
     It 's a trade secret how many were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastic</ENAMEX> , and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> still do n't know what they 're using .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H.F. Ahmanson & Co.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest thrift holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> earnings decline for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> while another large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">savings and loan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , reported a slight earnings gain .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H.F. Ahmanson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Home Savings of America</ENAMEX> , reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.2 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> a share , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">57 cents</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier period</TIMEX> .
     Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's effective tax rate to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago third quarter</TIMEX> when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     Pretax earnings declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 %</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">H.F. Ahmanson</ENAMEX> had profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 128.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.29</NUMEX> a share , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> decline from earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 134.2 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-ago nine months</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said the decline was attributable to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 %</NUMEX> reduction in net gains on loan sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> spreads widened to the highest level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two years</TIMEX> as loan portfolio yields rose and money costs declined , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Financial</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit rose slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 68.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">52 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 67.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , is a financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western Bank</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&L</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western</ENAMEX> said it had a sharp increase in margins in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent third quarter</TIMEX> .
     Margins are the difference between the yield on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's earning assets and its own cost of funds .
     But a reduction in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western</ENAMEX> 's provision for loan losses was increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.9 million</NUMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent quarter</TIMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.8 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> primarily as a result of `` continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> . ''
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Western</ENAMEX> posted net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 177.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.37</NUMEX> a share , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.9 %</NUMEX> decline from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 188.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.48</NUMEX> a share , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun & Bradstreet Corp.</ENAMEX> posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings .
     But revenue declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 2 %</NUMEX> , reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of credit services in the wake of controversy over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's sales practices .
     The information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also cited the stronger dollar , the sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> of its former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Official Airline Guides</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> and other factors .
     Net income rose to a record <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">83 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 134.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.04 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.07 billion</NUMEX> .
     In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.75</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the results were as expected , but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     `` The quality of earnings was n't as high as I expected , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Philo</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co .</ENAMEX>
     For example , he noted , operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated , but nonoperating earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.6 million</NUMEX> and a lower tax rate helped boost net income .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> said operating earnings rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> , excluding the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Official Airline Guides</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> credit services were `` disappointingly below sales '' of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> said .
     As previously reported , those sales have been declining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> in the wake of allegations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to overpurchase services .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18 million</NUMEX> settlement of related lawsuits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> predict the sales impact will linger .
     `` There is n't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Reidy </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> noted that price competition in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nielsen Marketing Research</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nielsen Clearing House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donnelley Marketing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> also restrained revenue growth .
     It cited cyclical conditions in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">D&B Plan Services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , net income rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 449 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.40</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 375.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.01</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Year-earlier</TIMEX> earnings reflected costs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.3 million</NUMEX> related to the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IMS International</ENAMEX> .
     Revenue rose slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.16 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.13 billion</NUMEX> .
