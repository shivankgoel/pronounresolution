     After a bad start , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were buoyed by a late burst of buying to end modestly higher .
     `` The market was pretty dull '' for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert H. Chandross</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyds Bank PLC .</ENAMEX>
     He said some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were reluctant to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's potentially market-moving employment report .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX> of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , prices fell as much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> point , or down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     But market activity was energized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> started to view the lower price levels as attractive .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.6 billion</NUMEX> auction of short-term bills , which generated strong buying interest , helped to lift the bond market out of the doldrums .
     `` We saw good retail demand by small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> and that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why the market advanced '' late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung Won Sohn</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Norwest Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> .
     He said the change in sentiment also reflected perceptions that the slate of economic statistic due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> will be `` conducive to a bond market rally . ''
     The employment report , which will provide the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> official measure of the economy 's strength in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , is expected to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs .
     Other key economic indicators due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's release of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> leading indicators index and new-home sales .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> report is due and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> chain-store sales .
     Despite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's modest bond market gains , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are anxious about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's huge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> refunding of government debt , the timing of which depends on Congressional efforts to raise the debt ceiling .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> will announce details of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> refunding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , it could be delayed if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> fail to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's borrowing capacity .
     The debt ceiling is scheduled to fall to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 trillion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.87 trillion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> point .
     Mortgage-backed securities were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1\/8</NUMEX> point and investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged .
     Strong demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 813 million</NUMEX> general obligation bonds propped up the municipal market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said most municipal bonds ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point higher .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> issue included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 757 million</NUMEX> of tax-exempt bonds priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 6.50 % to 7.88 %</NUMEX> , depending on the maturity .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's taxable general obligation bonds were priced to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 9.125 % to 9.90 %</NUMEX> .
     As expected , the longer-term tax-exempt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds .
     The yield on the benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.92 %</NUMEX> .
     Bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> bonds were among the highest , as a percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> rates , for any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> issue in recent memory .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said the high rates reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's financial health and political uncertainties .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> bonds , which have been hammered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> on the pending supply and reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's economy is growing weaker , rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ended slightly higher in light trading .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 7\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.92 %</NUMEX> , compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 2\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</NUMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100 16\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 11\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Short-term interest rates rose at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX>-bill auction .
     The average discount rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> bills was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.78 %</NUMEX> and the rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.62 %</NUMEX> .
     Those rates are up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.52 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.50 %</NUMEX> , respectively , at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's auction .
     Due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight tonight</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's auction was structured differently from previous sales .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> settle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the standard settlement day of Thursday</TIMEX> .
     And because of the early settlement , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> bills actually have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">93-day</TIMEX> maturity , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills have an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">184-day</TIMEX> maturity .
     Because of the early settlement , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> was unable to purchase bills for its system account .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills that were auctioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in the secondary market .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> also held a hastily scheduled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> sale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>-cash management bills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Here are details of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bill auction :
     Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
     Thus , higher bidding narrows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's return while lower bidding widens it .
     The percentage rates are calculated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a 360-day year</TIMEX> , while the coupon equivalent yield is based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a 365-day year</TIMEX> .
     Both issues are dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">13-week</TIMEX> bills mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Feb. 1</TIMEX> , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">26-week</TIMEX> bills mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 3 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     Here are details of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">51-day</TIMEX> cash management bill auction :
     Interest rate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.07 %</NUMEX>
     The bills are dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 31</TIMEX> and mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 21 , 1989</TIMEX> .
     Corporate Issues
     The junk bond prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union Corp.</ENAMEX> tumbled after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it wo n't proceed with an exchange offer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of its reset notes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Upper Saddle River</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> said it is considering alternatives to the restructuring of the senior secured notes because of changes in the high-yield market .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> was forced to reset the interest rate on the senior secured notes due in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 1\/4 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 1\/2 %</NUMEX> , a move which increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> interest payments by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13.8 million</NUMEX> .
     Although the notes held at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92 to 93</NUMEX> immediately after the reset , they started falling soon afterward .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> 's senior secured reset notes fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 3\/4</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 37.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount , to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 1\/4</NUMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> securities were also lower .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> sinking fund debentures were quoted at a bid price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 1\/4</NUMEX> and an offered price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 3\/4 %</NUMEX> subordinated debentures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> were being bid for at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> and offered at around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 3\/4</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 3\/4 %</NUMEX> debentures last traded at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> .
     High-yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said spreads between the bid and offered prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> junk bonds have been widening for some time , and in certain cases , bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Union</ENAMEX> securities are not available .
     Elsewhere , prices of investment-grade and high-risk , high-yield junk bonds ended unchanged .
     In the new-issue market for junk securities , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> are expected to price <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> junk bond offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice Co.</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part issue consists of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1997</TIMEX> .
     Portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said expectations are for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 3\/4 %</NUMEX> and a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 14 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based food and consumer goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> was acquired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 1986</TIMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.2 billion</NUMEX> leveraged buy-out engineered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co .</ENAMEX>
     Proceeds from the note sale will be used to repay a portion of the bank borrowings used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX> to redeem its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 526.3 million</NUMEX> principal amount of increasing rate debentures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> are expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> to price a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> high-yield offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Cablevision Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The senior subordinated debentures maturing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2004</TIMEX> are targeted to be offered at a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 12 5\/8 % to 12 3\/4 %</NUMEX> .
     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     Mortgage securities ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2\/32 to 4\/32</NUMEX> higher in light trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 1\/2</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4\/32</NUMEX> , and its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> issue at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 3\/8</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4\/32</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 19\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2\/32</NUMEX> .
     In the derivative market , insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have scaled back their purchases of Remic securities , or real estate mortgage investment conduits , as they assess potential claims from the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake and hurricane in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> .
     This could mean diminished issuance of derivative mortgage issues during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few weeks</TIMEX> .
     Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have been major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> of prepayment-protected planned amortization classes -LRB- PACs -RRB- during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past few months</TIMEX> .
     The PACs appeal to insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> , quasi-federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     In the asset-backed market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beneficial Corp.</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 248 million</NUMEX> of securities backed by home-equity loans , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> large deal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MNC Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 268 million</NUMEX> of home-equity securities .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MNC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beneficial</ENAMEX> offering were underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> , the leading Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in the home-equity securities market , which was created <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early this year</TIMEX> .
     Municipal Issues
     The improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and Tbond futures continued to grow more negative .
     The MOB spread , or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> municipal futures ended up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11\/32</NUMEX> point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-14</NUMEX> , having pulled off a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91-23</NUMEX> as cash municipals rebounded .
     But front <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> T-bond futures settled the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> session up a slightly greater <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13\/32</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99-04</NUMEX> .
     Foreign Bonds
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government bonds ended moderately higher , encouraged by a steadier pound and a rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> stocks .
     The benchmark <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3\/4 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2003\/2007</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10\/32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 14\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.14 %</NUMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7\/32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 5\/8</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.04 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> government bonds fell as much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX> point in light , nervous trading .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> ended off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX> point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.35</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.09 %</NUMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 3\/4 %</NUMEX> notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX> point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97.25</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.45 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> government bonds continued to erode as the dollar remained resilient against the yen .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's No. 111 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> on brokers screens at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.11</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.43 %</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe Inc.</ENAMEX> , a biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 110 million</NUMEX> , or almost double the market price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> 's stock .
     The move is sure to heighten concerns about increased <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     It is also likely to bolster fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> will use their foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> to gain certain trade and competitive advantages .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> , an industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">leader</ENAMEX> in the field of genetic probes , which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> signed an agreement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> to exclusively market its diagnostic products in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> for infectious diseases and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs .
     That arrangement apparently has worked well , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas A. Bologna</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> , founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> , said the sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> means `` we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> agreed to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.25</NUMEX> a share for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.6 million</NUMEX> common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis .

     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will buy <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition . `` The biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> may be setting up their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Godown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Industrial Biotechnology Association</ENAMEX> .
     He added that until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">now</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have only acquired equity positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     `` They are piggybacking onto developed technology , '' he said .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past five years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> have invested in several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">431</NUMEX> independent biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> has been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most active <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ; it has an equity investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Genetics Institute Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , and a joint-venture agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Upjohn Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kalamazoo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godown</ENAMEX> said , has stated that it wants <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 % to 11 %</NUMEX> of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products .
     `` It is becoming more of a horse race <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' he said , adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor , electronics , and automobile industries , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will use <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-developed technology to gain trade advantages .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX> said the sale would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> to speed up the development of new technology , and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> wants to offer .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX> genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> had been approved for marketing by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of them had been developed and sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osamu Nagayama</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> , which spends <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> of its sales on research and development , was unable to pinpoint how much money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> would pump into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> .
     `` We think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> has technology important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's health , '' he said , adding : `` We think it is important for us to have such technology . ''
     He and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX> emphasized that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> would gain technological knowledge through the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> , which will expand `` significantly '' as a result of the acquisition .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> had net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 60 million</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 991 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GenProbe</ENAMEX> had a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.5 million</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.8 million</NUMEX> .
     Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> received a broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> patent for a technology that helps detect , identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> .
     Among other things , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX> said that the sale will facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> 's marketing of a diagnostic test for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired immune deficiency syndrome</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> also will help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> with its regulatory and marketing expertise in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX> said .
     The tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gen-Probe</ENAMEX> 's shares is expected to begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Monday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said .

     It was supposed to be a routine courtesy call .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A half-dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> space <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> for an exhibit , stopped by to see their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Space Development Agency</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     But after a few pleasantries , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> unexpectedly got serious .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> have a world-leading space program , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> noted .
     Would n't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> like a piece of it ?
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware . `` We were just surprised , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tad Inada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NASDA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for international affairs .
     `` Shocked . ''
     That <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , with its dilapidated economic machine , would try to sell high technology to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the world 's high-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">leaders</ENAMEX> , sounds like a coals-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newcastle</ENAMEX> notion . But `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has areas where it is n't behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Shapovalov</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have obtained through the development of Cosmos -LCB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> space program -RCB- technologies you do n't see anywhere else . ''
     The sales pitch might n't be as farfetched as it seems .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade relations are bumpy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> favor decreasing their reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> technology in light of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">FSX fighter-plane</ENAMEX> flap , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fighter-plane</ENAMEX> technology .
     And , despite its image as a technology <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">superpower</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has a lot of weaknesses .
     It 's a world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">leader</ENAMEX> in semiconductors , but behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in making the computers that use those chips .
     It 's a world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">leader</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> manufacturing , but its aviation industry is struggling , and its space program is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> question being debated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> is how to use the defense sector 's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions , videocassette recorders , small tractors and food-processing machinery .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science , which has helped them win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice as many</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Nobel</ENAMEX> science prizes as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
     Where they lag behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production .
     By contrast , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have proved adept at making use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> inventions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kobe Steel Ltd.</ENAMEX> adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> casting technology in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1966</TIMEX> and used it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">14 years</TIMEX> until it developed its own system .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kawasaki Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> steel-casting patent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> and has jointly developed the system with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> will take a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> into space , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> to go into orbit .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's principal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">ally</ENAMEX> . `` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     `` Frankly , I would n't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> to get hooked on anybody 's technology , least of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> . ''
     Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's perestroika , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets .
     They believe technology is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of their best bets , and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> to push more space technologies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is a major target for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Keidanren</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's largest business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> , visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> to explore exports and investments that would help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> economy .
     Out of the blue , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Soviet Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> handed over details on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> technologies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> might want to buy .
     These mainly involved such areas as materials -- advanced soldering machines , for example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space , such as artificial blood vessels .
     A main motive is hard cash .
     But , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> ca n't expect direct technology flow from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , they also hope to benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> manufacturing expertise . `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has a lot of know-how , but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapovalov</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> are `` contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop -LCB- technology -RCB- jointly and even to market it jointly , '' he says .
     Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> technology desirable , such discussions would be fraught with political complications .
     Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> of sensitive military technology to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are eager to avoid appearing to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> in any way .
     Another hurdle concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's attempts to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to relinquish its post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> control of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> islands north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     So far , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans .
     And what they have shown is n't impressive . `` My impression is that there is n't anything which arouses our interest at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance , '' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> .

     -LRB- During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its centennial year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past century</TIMEX> that stand as milestones of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business history . -RRB-
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">MAY 1 , 1975</TIMEX> , SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May Day</TIMEX> for securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> , which were forced to end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">183 years</TIMEX> of charging fixed commissions .
     It scared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> , but most survived .
     It took effect after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> of bitter debate between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Despite warnings from such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> as former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William McChesney Martin</ENAMEX> that unfixed commissions would undo the industry , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1973</TIMEX> said full competition must start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May l , 1975</TIMEX> .
     The timing for change was right .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Institutions</ENAMEX> had become active market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> in the early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1970s</TIMEX> and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades .
     And the industry was rife with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and junkets .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three weeks</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> fighting for institutional business , with rate slashes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 % to 60 %</NUMEX> below pre-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 1</TIMEX> levels .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Garrett Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , said the `` breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected . ''
     Even a federal measure in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> to add research fees to their commissions did n't stop it .
     Longer term , the impact is unclear .
     The change prompted the rise of discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> and a reduction in securities research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     But there are currently more exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">members</ENAMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> , with the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">houses</ENAMEX> gaining a larger share of total commissions .
     Commissions , however , account for a smaller share of investment-house business as takeover advisory fees have soared .
     Foreign stock markets , with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is entwined , also have ended fixed commissions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> .
     It came in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's `` Big Bang '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> deregulation ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX> 's `` Little Bang '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> is currently phasing out fixed commissions under its `` Le Petit Bang '' plan .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">cabinet</ENAMEX> will lead a presidential mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> to gauge how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can help the new non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's economic changes .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">several weeks ago</TIMEX> that he intended to send such a mission , composed of top government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> and business and labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> .
     The mission will visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 29</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 2</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> said .
     In remarks at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> ceremony marking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Polish Heritage Month</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agriculture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Yeutter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> will lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boskin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Council of Economic Advisers</ENAMEX> , also will be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Harper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ConAgra Inc.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McGillicuddy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> , will be among a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 15</NUMEX> business and labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in the presidential mission .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is to `` focus on economic sectors where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 400 million</NUMEX> in economic aid and food grants for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , but has been chided by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> for failing to do more .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Azoff</ENAMEX> , who resigned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> as head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA Records</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> declined comment , as did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> , where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> had also been discussing such a venture .
     But record industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> familiar with the talks said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> came to an agreement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to form a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> joint-venture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and run by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> .
     Among other things , they said , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> would develop musical acts for a new record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">label</ENAMEX> .
     The agreement is said to be similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> partnership with record and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Geffen</ENAMEX> , whose films and records are distributed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> records <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> wo n't produce films at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , it is possible that he could do so later , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said .
     Like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geffen</ENAMEX> 's arrangement , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">venture</ENAMEX> gives Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> a link to the world 's largest and most successful record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor</ENAMEX> ; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> alone , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> share of the market , about double its nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , it gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">41-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> , a former rock 'n' roll <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> , is credited with turning around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> 's once-moribund music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his six years</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> had been negotiating for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a year</TIMEX> to get out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> contract , which expired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azoff</ENAMEX> also was eager to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts .
     In an interview at the time of his resignation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCA</ENAMEX> , he said : `` I 'd rather build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> than run one .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Panelli</ENAMEX> had a perfectly good reason for not using the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX> rowing machine he bought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> .
     `` I ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he says , making it too painful to row .
     The soreness , he admits , went away <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a week</TIMEX> after the shot .
     Yet the rowing machine has n't been touched since , even though he has moved it across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> with him twice .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panelli</ENAMEX> rowed religiously when he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got the machine , but , he complains , it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring .
     It 's a horrible machine , actually .
     I 'm ashamed I own the stupid thing . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panelli</ENAMEX> has plenty of company .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly three-fourths</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">American Way of Buying</ENAMEX> '' survey .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Roper Organization</ENAMEX> , which conducted the survey , said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of the exercise equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> found it duller than they expected .
     It is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout .
     The fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey found .
     Fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> , swimming and aerobics .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> of those surveyed said they simply walk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> for exercise .
     That 's good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX> of walking shoes .
     The survey also detected a bit more interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> , a positive sign for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">country clubs</ENAMEX> and golf club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> .
     The survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships , tennis rackets and home exercise equipment , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's good intentions , if not their actions , are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy .
     For instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are expected to rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.52 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Sporting Goods Association</ENAMEX> , which sees the home market as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the hottest growth areas for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     But even that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> knows some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't use their machines as much as they should . `` The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> excuse is they do n't have enough time , '' says research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Doyle</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is they do n't have enough discipline . ''
     With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 15 million</NUMEX> exercise bikes sold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past five years</TIMEX> , he adds , `` a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garages</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">basements</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">attics</ENAMEX> must be populated with them . ''
     Still , the average price of such bikes rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doyle</ENAMEX> predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices .
     Electronic gimmicks are key .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Premark International Inc.</ENAMEX> , for example , peddles the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">M8.7sp Electronic Cycling Simulator</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2,000</NUMEX> stationary cycle .
     On a video screen , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> can see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> different `` rides , '' including urban , mountain and desert scenes , and check how many calories are burned a minute .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Igdaloff</ENAMEX> , who works in corporate payments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , may be a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospect</ENAMEX> for such a gizmo .
     She 's trying to sell a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150</NUMEX> exercise bike she bought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about five years ago</TIMEX> for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> .
     But rather than write off home fitness equipment , she traded up : Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igdaloff</ENAMEX> just paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 900</NUMEX> for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair .
     `` I 'm using it a lot , '' she says .
     `` I spent so much money that if I look at it , and I 'm not on it , I feel guilty . ''
     The poll points up some inconsistencies between what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say and what they do .
     A surprising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said they exercise regularly , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     This conjures up images of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> full of trim , muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> , and suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch potatoes</ENAMEX> are out of season .
     Of course , that is n't really the case .
     The discrepancy may be because asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life .
     They 're bound to exaggerate . `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys Spain</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's hard to know if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are responding truthfully .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything . ''
     While she applauds the fact that more <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 % to 20 %</NUMEX> .
     So many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fudge on answers about exercise , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more times a week for a minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">council</ENAMEX> 's goals , set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , was to see more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under 65 years of age</TIMEX> getting vigorous exercise by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> .
     That target has been revised to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> .
     But even that goal may prove optimistic .
     Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> activities , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Journal</ENAMEX> survey found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> -- including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years ago</TIMEX> .
     Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline .
     Only walking and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> increased in popularity during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980s</TIMEX> -- and only slightly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeanette Traverso</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , gave up running <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a week to play a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> , finding it more social and serene .
     It 's an activity she feels she can do for life , and by pulling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">golf cart</ENAMEX> , she still gets a good workout .
     `` I 'm really wiped out after walking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five hours</TIMEX> , '' she says .
     Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said they exercise both for health and enjoyment . `` If you sit down all the time , you 'll go stiff , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Hagood</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Roxboro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homemaker</ENAMEX> who walks <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">several miles</NUMEX> a week .
     `` And it 's relaxing .
     Sometimes , if you have a headache , you can go out and walk it right off . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only about a quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> said they exercise to lose weight .
     Slightly more , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Sherren</ENAMEX> , a law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> who attends dance aerobics <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times a week , exercise to relieve stress .
     `` Working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , '' she says , `` I need it . ''
     But fully <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> of those polled felt they did n't need to belong to a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">club</ENAMEX> . `` They 're too crowded , and everybody 's showing off , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Bryant</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">22-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pasadena</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are being macho , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are walking around in little things .
     They 're not there to work out . ''
     But at least they show up .
     Nearly half of those who joined health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clubs</ENAMEX> said they did n't use their membership as often as they planned .
     Feeling they should devote more time to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> or their jobs , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> are skipping their once-sacred workout .
     Even so , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Association of Quality Clubs</ENAMEX> , a health-club trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , says membership revenues will rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 billion</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> adds , however , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is considering offering `` a behavior-modification course , similar to a smoking-cessation program , to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ways to stay with it . ''
     There are die-hard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> , of course .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sante West</ENAMEX> , an aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina district</ENAMEX> , which was hit hard by the earthquake , says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were going nuts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</TIMEX> we opened , '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> after the quake .
     `` The emotional aspect is so draining , they needed a good workout . ''
     Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alley</ENAMEX> may be an endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> institution .
     The survey reported the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who said they bowl regularly has fallen to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 8 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Bowling Congress</ENAMEX> claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes its membership has declined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this decade</TIMEX> .
     To find out why , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> recently commissioned a study of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 20 years</TIMEX> of bowling-related research .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> reasons were pinpointed : a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling , dowdy bowling centers , and dissatisfaction with bowling itself .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who start bowling expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise `` have been generally disappointed , '' the report said .
     But not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Cottrell</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> cab <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> who bowls in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">leagues</ENAMEX> .
     He hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years ago</TIMEX> on the advice of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's good exercise , '' he says .
     `` I ca n't do anything score-wise , but I like meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> . ''
     He says bowling helps him shed pounds , though that effort is sometimes thwarted by the fact that `` when I 'm drinking , I bowl better . ''
     His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">team</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Leftovers</ENAMEX> , is in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place .

     Private housing starts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> were unchanged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144,610</NUMEX> units , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Construction Ministry</ENAMEX> said .
     The flat report followed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-month</TIMEX> string of declines .
     The down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked by a discount rate increase by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> .
     The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> also unexpectedly raised the base rate by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.75 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 11</TIMEX> as part of an inflation-fighting move that indirectly increases interest rates charged on new home construction loans .

     If there 's somethin' strange in your neighborhood ...
     If there 's something ' weird and it do n't look good .
     Who ya gon na call ?
     For starters , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine Warren</ENAMEX> .
     When it comes to busting ghosts , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Monroe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> are perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> .
     They claim to have busted spirits , poltergeists and other spooks in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     They say they now get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> `` legitimate '' calls a week from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> harried by haunts . `` I firmly believe in angels , devils and ghosts , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> , whose business card identifies him as a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonologist</ENAMEX> . ''
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychics</ENAMEX> do n't work , but your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> still seems haunted , you can call any one of a swelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Busch .</ENAMEX>
     A professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magician</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> , he heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX> says there is a scientific explanation for all haunts , and he can even tell you how to encourage the spirits .
     `` All you have to do is eat a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizza</ENAMEX> , and then go to bed , '' he says .
     `` You 'll have weird dreams , too . ''
     Either way , the ghostbusting business is going like gangbusters .
     Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Elm Streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Amityvilles</ENAMEX> . `` I get calls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">nearly every day</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have ghosts in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Hyman</ENAMEX> , a skeptical psychology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Oregon</ENAMEX> .
     In a public opinion poll published in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Parents Magazine</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . `` The movies , the books , the tabloids -- even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Reagan</ENAMEX> is boosting this stuff , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kurtz</ENAMEX> , a philosophy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">State University of New York at Buffalo</ENAMEX> , who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> , formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1967</TIMEX> , now has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">chapters</ENAMEX> around the world .
     The spirits , of course , could hardly care less whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do or do n't believe in them .
     They do n't even give a nod to human sensibilities by celebrating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> .
     For the spooks it 's just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">another day</TIMEX> of ectoplasmic business as usual , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ghostbusters</ENAMEX> say ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the holiday</TIMEX> seems to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ghostbusters</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Baker</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">68-year-old</TIMEX> semi-retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Kentucky</ENAMEX> psychology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> whose bushy gray eyebrows arch at the mere mention of a ghost .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> says he has personally bested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> haunts , from aliens to poltergeists .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics</ENAMEX> .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Hollywood</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ghostbusters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> 's stand ready to roll when haunts get out of hand .
     But they do n't careen around in an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> , wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> drives a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays .
     `` I 've never met a ghost that could n't be explained away by perfectly natural means , '' he says .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> complained that a ghost was haunting her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">attic</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> discovered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> dragging a trap across the rafters .
     A foul-smelling demon supposedly plagued a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mannington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> found an opening under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> that led to a fume-filled coal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">mine</ENAMEX> .
     When the weather cools , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hobos</ENAMEX> often hole up in abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> see activity in there , and the next thing you know , you 've got a haunting , '' he says .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a recent afternoon</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> go ghost-busting , visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Stinnett</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who has phoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Kentucky</ENAMEX> to report mysterious happenings in her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stinnett</ENAMEX> says she never believed in ghosts before , but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on , a telephone flew off its stand , doors slammed inexplicably , and she heard footsteps in her empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">kitchen</ENAMEX> .
     `` I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">upstairs</ENAMEX> to see who was there , and it was nobody , '' she says , eyes wide at the recollection .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> hears her out , pokes around a bit , asks a few questions and proposes some explanations .
     Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner , he says : `` Could be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cuddles</ENAMEX> , -LCB- Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stinnett</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> -RCB- . ''
     The flying telephone : `` You tangle the base cord around a chair leg , and the receiver does seem to fly off . ''
     The ghostly footsteps : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate 64</ENAMEX> is a block away , and heavy traffic can sure set a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> to vibrating . ''
     `` I 'm not sure he 's explained everything , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stinnett</ENAMEX> says grudgingly .
     `` There are some things that have gone on here that nobody can explain , '' she says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> promises to return if the haunting continues .
     For especially stubborn haunts , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> carries a secret weapon , a vial of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cornstarch</ENAMEX> .
     `` I tell people it 's the groundup bones of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> , '' he says .
     `` I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave .
     It 's reassuring , and it usually works . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyman</ENAMEX> has investigated claims of flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> , apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation , he says , for every one .
     `` Invariably , '' he says , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eyewitnesses</ENAMEX> are untrustworthy . ''
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> bet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omni Magazine</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> that it could n't debunk the uncanny goings-on in `` the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Oregon Vortex</ENAMEX> , '' a former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Indian</ENAMEX> burial ground in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> .
     To <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> from a distance , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the spot seemed to shrink disproportionately , relative to the background .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> called in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyman</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> .
     He showed up with a carpenter 's level , carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused by the perspective .
     `` A very striking illusion , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyman</ENAMEX> says now , his voice dripping with skepticism , `` but an illusion nevertheless . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> wound up writing a check .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alphonsus Trabold</ENAMEX> , a theology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> and exorcism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">St. Bonaventure University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Olean</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , frequently is asked to exorcise unruly spirits , and he often obliges .
     `` On certain occasions a spirit could be earthbound and make itself known , '' he says .
     `` It happens . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trabold</ENAMEX> often uses what he calls `` a therapeutic exorcism '' : a few prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave .
     `` If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> believes there 's an evil spirit , you ask it to be gone , '' he says .
     `` The suggestion itself may do the healing . ''
     But sometimes more energetic attacks are required .
     To wrestle with a demon in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> owned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Litchfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warrens</ENAMEX> recently called in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exorcist</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert McKenna</ENAMEX> , a dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergyman</ENAMEX> who hews to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> 's old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> liturgy .
     I attend , and so does a television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> pronounces the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Litchfield</ENAMEX> case `` your typical demonic infestation . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwarf</ENAMEX> built the small red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">110 years ago</TIMEX> and now his demonic ghost haunts it , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> , who begs anonymity , asserts that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwarf</ENAMEX> , appearing as a dark <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> , has manhandled her , tossing her around the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> and yanking out a hank of hair .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> previous exorcisms have failed .
     `` This is a very tenacious ghost , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> says darkly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKenna</ENAMEX> moves through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> praying in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> , urging the demon to split .
     Suddenly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> begins swaying and then writhing .
     `` She 's being attacked by the demon , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> stagewhispers as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> sprinkles holy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> over the squirming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> , and the television camera grinds .
     <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A half-hour later</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is smiling and chatting ; the demon seems to have gone .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has `` psychic burns '' on her back from the confrontation .
     She declines to show them .
     `` This was an invisible , powerful force that 's almost impossible for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">layman</ENAMEX> to contemplate , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> says solemnly as the ghostbusting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage</ENAMEX> packs up to leave .
     `` This time though , '' he says , `` I think we got it . ''

     BROKERAGE HIRING languishes amid market turmoil .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> earn more .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> counts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 39,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of the year</TIMEX> and off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,500</NUMEX> from after its merger and the market collapse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Another major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has cut <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bureau of Labor Statistics</ENAMEX> says securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> alone have slashed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</NUMEX> jobs from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1987</TIMEX> peak of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163,000</NUMEX> .
     Average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> earnings of those who have hung on , though , surged to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 78,625</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 69,553</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Any hiring is confined to retail sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Illinois Company Investments</ENAMEX> had been trimming its ranks until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last summer</TIMEX> .
     But then it was acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Household International Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> it offers richer commissions to lure a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> a week .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.G. Edwards & Sons</ENAMEX> runs training classes and looks for experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 're always going to hire someone we consider to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edwards</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> says .
     SKILLED <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">WORKERS</ENAMEX> aplenty are available to cope with earthquake damage . `` I do n't foresee any shortages over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next few months</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Allen</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Operating Engineers Local 3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> .
     Ironically , `` up until the quake , we desperately tried to fill jobs , '' especially for crane and bulldozer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> .
     But the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 17</TIMEX> temblor put a halt to much nonessential building , and heavy rains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> slowed the rest , freeing construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for earthquake repairs .
     The supply of experienced civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> , though , is tighter .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> has been recruiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> experienced in road and bridge design . But , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> offering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 39,000</NUMEX> a year and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's high standard of living , `` there are n't too many to choose from , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scott</ENAMEX> , a recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> .
     He says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> now has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> openings and wants to hire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">625</NUMEX> civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next 15 months</TIMEX> .
     THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> may taketh what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> giveth .
     But stay tuned .
     Employee-benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> drew a collective sigh of relief in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> backed away from a proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> let former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> -- along with active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> -- borrow against balances in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and similar savings plans .
     In an advisory letter , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said that , starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 18</TIMEX> , loans could be limited to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> in interest , '' which generally means active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> but also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> who continue as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> .
     Now comes word that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> regulations being drafted could put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in violation of the tax code if they make loans to retiree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> but do n't make them available to other former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who usually earned less .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> says the question wo n't be settled until the regulations are issued `` shortly . ''
     But violation could bring substantial tax penalties to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> . `` It 's a severe case of regulatory whiplash , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Saveth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">A.

     Democracy is making a return with a vengeance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> 's most populous and deeply indebted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilians</ENAMEX> elect a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">29 years</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to choose from .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> have been crisscrossing this huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the world 's most thankless political jobs : trying to drag <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> out of its economic and social mess . `` I feel sorry for whoever wins , '' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> .
     Who that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> will be is highly uncertain .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A half-dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> , backing policies ranging from Thatcherism to watered-down Marxism , are given a chance of winning . `` Whoever says he knows which of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> will win is out of his mind , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Britto</ENAMEX> , a centrist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Parliament</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Collor de Mello</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">40-year-old</TIMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alagoas</ENAMEX> .
     He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls , probably less because of his vague program to `` build a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> '' than because of his good looks , the open backing of the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rede Globo</ENAMEX> television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> and his reputation as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maharajahs</ENAMEX> , '' or overpaid and underworked civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> .
     But after building up a commanding lead , the moderate to conservative Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collor</ENAMEX> has slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</NUMEX> in the polls from a high of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 43 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only a few weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     To avoid a runoff , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> would have to win <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of the vote -- a feat that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> consider impossible with so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> running .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Socialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonel Brizola</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Rio de Janeiro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , and Marxist-leaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Inacio da Silva</ENAMEX> , currently are running neck and neck at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are given a chance of reaching the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 17</TIMEX> runoff election between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vote-getters</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Social Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Covas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paulo Salim Maluf</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Sao Paulo</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guilherme Afif Domingos</ENAMEX> .
     The uncertainty is sending shivers through <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> financial markets .
     The dollar , the best indicator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold .
     Capital flight is reported to be strong .
     The big question is whether the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> will have the strength and the political support in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to take steps to cure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> 's economic ills .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Sarney</ENAMEX> , who took office in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> picked by an electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">college</ENAMEX> became critically ill , appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation .
     The unpopular Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> , whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">21 years</TIMEX> of military rule , is n't seeking re-election .
     What comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in determining whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> finally lives up to the potential of the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> largest economy or keeps living up to its other , less enviable title : that of the developing world 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">debtor</ENAMEX> , teetering on the brink of hyperinflation , mired in deficits and stagnation , with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt , this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , just as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Argentinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Saul Menem</ENAMEX> has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform . `` Depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , we could either be a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion-dollar</NUMEX> economy by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the century</TIMEX> or stay where we are , '' says political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amaury de Souza</ENAMEX> .
     `` And where we are is bad . ''
     Despite valiant efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega</ENAMEX> , inflation came to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> alone and is expected to top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1,000 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Argentina</ENAMEX> endured price increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 200 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> before bringing the rate down sharply in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Still , massive internal debt has forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 % to 3 %</NUMEX> a month just to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to hold on to its paper .
     <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">About $ 70 billion</NUMEX> is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     By some estimates , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> 's internal debt , or combined public deficit , could reach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 351 billion</NUMEX> gross domestic product .
     Much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> operating .
     Among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services .
     It 's not uncommon to wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX> for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending ; focusing spending on vital areas such as education , health and welfare ; turning state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> also say it 's inevitable that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> will seek to renegotiate its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 115 billion</NUMEX> foreign debt , on which it suspended interest payments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say , however , that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> from its recessionary effects , for instance by subsidizing staple food <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">items</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 80 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Brazil</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> are believed to live near the poverty level .
     Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> with a serious chance of winning , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collor</ENAMEX> comes closest to advocating the sort of measures that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> say are necessary .
     But his inexperience raises doubts that he would have the political power to carry them out .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">67-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brizola</ENAMEX> has been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say he probably would be pragmatic .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Silva</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">43-year-old</TIMEX> former factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> and labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , is the most radical , vowing to withhold payments on the foreign debt and saying he `` would n't go around putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> up for sale to the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> . ''
     But despite the differences in what they say , according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> here , economic constraints mean the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> may not have many choices about what he does .

     Hospital Regulation Sparks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> Feud
     WHICH IS the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">medicine</ENAMEX> for runaway health costs : competition or regulation ?
     The question is at the root of a brawl between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana Inc.</ENAMEX> , the big for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and its not-for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">brethren</ENAMEX> in its home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> .
     The battle focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's certificate-of-need law , which regulates investment in new medical technology .
     The law has prevented <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 216 million</NUMEX> of unnecessary expenditures since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Conn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Kentucky Hospital Association</ENAMEX> .
     But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Jones</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , it promotes technology monopolies , stifles innovation and raises prices .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Legislature</ENAMEX> does n't repeal the law , due for revision in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> may move its insurance operations , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> jobs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> , to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> complains that it paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its latest fiscal year</TIMEX> for services provided to its insurance plan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> says its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> could serve its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured</ENAMEX> for less if they were properly equipped .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conn</ENAMEX> charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> 's own actions undermine its argument .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> installed a lithotripter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOSPITAL">Humana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Louisville</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOSPITAL">Humana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conn</ENAMEX> says , and now charges <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 8,000</NUMEX> for the procedure , which costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $ 3,500</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> contends that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8,000</NUMEX> represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4,900</NUMEX> .
     Meanwhile , another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> 's proposal for a new-generation lithotripter is pending before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> that administers the certificate-of-need law .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Humana</ENAMEX> , which wants to acquire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the new machines itself , is on the record as opposed to the proposal .
     Debt-Burdened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> Seek Financial Security
     HEALTH-CARE <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> have long worried that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> emerging from medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are needed most .
     Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> want : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> professional position .
     And <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 %</NUMEX> preferred a group practice or health maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> , while just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> favored solo practice . `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Ten years ago</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> would go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">town</ENAMEX> and take out a loan -LRB- to start a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">practice</ENAMEX> -RRB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Merritt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merritt , Hawkins & Associates</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Irvine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , physician <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruiter</ENAMEX> that conducted the survey .
     `` They wo n't do that very often <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> at all .
     They 're looking for something that 's very safe . ''
     The numbers behind such fears : The average debt of medical school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> who borrowed to pay for their education jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42,374</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38,489</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Association of American Medical Colleges</ENAMEX> .
     That 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">115 %</NUMEX> more than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> .
     Money is n't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences . It reflects values of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that wants more time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and personal interests , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Moxley III</ENAMEX> , who directs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician-executive</ENAMEX> searches for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Korn\/Ferry International</ENAMEX> .

     It also saves money .
     Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> require less attention from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , room charges are lower -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100 less</NUMEX> per day than a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Vermont</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">hospital</ENAMEX> .

     The approach has generated so much interest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">NYU</ENAMEX> is host to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> conference on cooperative care <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 30</TIMEX> .

     The offer came just prior to arguments before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Free Press</ENAMEX> should be allowed to enter into a joint operating pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gannett Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Detroit News</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM Energy Co.</ENAMEX> said it filed materials with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> calling for it to restructure into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> from a limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnership</ENAMEX> said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM</ENAMEX> suspended its common distribution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June 1988</TIMEX> and the distribution on its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 million</NUMEX> a year , hurting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM</ENAMEX> 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM</ENAMEX> said .
     In following several other oil and gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> that have made the conversion to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM</ENAMEX> also noted that tax advantages for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partnerships</ENAMEX> have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</NUMEX> a year in administrative costs from the change .
     Under the plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of its common units will receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> share of new common stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edisto Resources Corp.</ENAMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.97</NUMEX> common units owned .

     After the transaction , current common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unitholders</ENAMEX> will own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21.3 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edisto</ENAMEX> , current acquisition preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> will own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.3 %</NUMEX> , and current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edisto</ENAMEX> will own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.4 %</NUMEX> , about the same stake as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Edisto</ENAMEX> owns now in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NRM</ENAMEX> .

     The recently revived enthusiasm among small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> for stock mutual funds has been damped by a jittery stock market and the tumult over program trading .
     After hitting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> highs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> , net sales of stock funds slowed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Investment Company Institute</ENAMEX> , a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     The sales recovery screeched to a halt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say . `` Confidence was starting to come back because we did n't have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">wildly volatile days</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler Jenks</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kanon Bloch Carre & Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .

     But if reinvested dividends are excluded , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> put in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $ 340 million</NUMEX> more than they pulled out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the month</TIMEX> .

     Most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds .
     And some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> actually became net <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     But the stock market swings have continued .
     The recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the stock-fund environment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming months</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is very close to having had it , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenks</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> pulled back from bond funds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , too .
     Net sales of bond funds for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the month</TIMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1 billion</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     The major reason : heavy outflows from high-risk , high-yield junk bond funds .
     Big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> .
     Overall , net sales of all mutual funds , excluding money market funds , fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.9 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> said . `` Small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios '' stemming from falling prices , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Dreyer</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> .
     Many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> went for the safety of money market funds .
     Assets of these and other short-term funds surged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 5 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">institute</ENAMEX> said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> transferred their assets into money funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> , net sales of stock funds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> dropped sharply , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hines</ENAMEX> said .
     But he emphasized that new accounts , new sales , inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's level .
     Investor interest in stock funds `` has n't stalled at all , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hines</ENAMEX> maintains .
     He notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-day</TIMEX> period following the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> plunge .
     `` If that follows through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">next month</TIMEX> , then it will be a different story , '' he says .
     But , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hines</ENAMEX> adds , sales `` based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few days</TIMEX> ' events do n't tell you much about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> 's trends . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds .
     Buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds , assets of all mutual funds swelled to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 953.8 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , up fractionally from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 949.3 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Stock-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , meantime , went into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> with less cash on hand than they held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> held <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.8 %</NUMEX> of assets in cash at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of September</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> .
     Large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> cash crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Junk-portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> raised their cash position to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.4 %</NUMEX> of assets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> , that level was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.5 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> in all funds will seek safety in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming months</TIMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     Among stock funds , the conservative growth-and-income portfolios probably will remain popular , fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> say . `` There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds , at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avi Nachmany</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Strategic Insight</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> fund-research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> .

     Dark hints would be raised that parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> hope Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> would fail , just as they were when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> voiced similar sentiments .
     It 's somehow OK for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> himself , however , to say all the same things .
     In fact , he did ; the quotes above are from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> 's speech of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     So far as we can see , there is no disagreement among Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> , the Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> we 've read , or for that matter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
     They all understand point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> : Nothing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can do will make much difference in whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> succeeds with perestroika .
     Perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> would emphasize more than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> the many hurdles the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> must leap if he is going to succeed .
     But everyone agrees that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> 's problems result from the failure of his own system .
     They can be relieved only by changing that system , not by pouring Western money into it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">GATT</ENAMEX> membership will not matter to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Donbas</ENAMEX> coal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> short of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">soap</ENAMEX> , nor will a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">START</ENAMEX> treaty make any difference to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ukrainian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> .
     On the other hand , so long as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is easing his grip on his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">empire</ENAMEX> , everyone we 've heard agrees that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can benefit by engaging him .
     If a deal can be made to cut the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortegas</ENAMEX> loose from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Moscow</ENAMEX> , why not ?
     We do n't expect much good from nuclear-arms control , but conventional-arms talks might demilitarize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> .
     There 's nothing in the least contradictory in all this , and it would be nice to think that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated , complex view .
     Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> for not `` helping '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> .
     So every time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> raises a doubt about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> shouts `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">Cold War</ENAMEX> '' and `` timidity , '' and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> is quickly trotted out to reply , `` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wants perestroika to succeed . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> seems especially sensitive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> ailment known as Beltway-itis .
     Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate , clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism , and fainting spells when someone writes the word `` controversy . ''
     As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> clearly in the late stages of the disease told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Times</ENAMEX> : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press . ''
     In short , the problem is not intra-administration disagreement , but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail , and its political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> will ask `` Who lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> ? ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> may want to avoid criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> , but as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is the entire Free World , not just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     In any case , he 's likely to find that the more he muzzles his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , the more leaks will pop up all around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , a lesson once learned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX> .
     Letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> express their own nuances can be educational .
     We note that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rome</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> euphoria over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is starting to be tempered by a recognition of `` the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with . ''
     It is in the Western interest to see Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> succeed .
     The odds are against him , as he himself would no doubt tell you .
     The ultimate outcome depends on what he does , not on what we do .
     Even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret , these are not very complicated thoughts .
     Surely there is someone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> , maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Gates</ENAMEX> , who could explain them to college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> .
