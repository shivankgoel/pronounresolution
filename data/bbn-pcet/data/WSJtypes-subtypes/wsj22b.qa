     Chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Chains</ENAMEX> Ruffled By Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX>
     FAST-FOOD chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> , faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">The Crest Report</ENAMEX> , which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , while the overall fast-food customer count was down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> .
     Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> , home-delivered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pizza</ENAMEX> and other takeout <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fare</ENAMEX> , says a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the report , a publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NPD Group</ENAMEX> , a market research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Port Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y .</ENAMEX>
     The loss of more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> is the latest in a string of problems .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Church 's Fried Chicken Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc.</ENAMEX> , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations .
     Chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> also are feeling more pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's Corp.</ENAMEX> , which introduced its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">McChicken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sandwich</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken</ENAMEX> .
     New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> , has fought back with new medium and large chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sandwiches</ENAMEX> for the lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> is testing products that are n't fried , such as `` char-grilled '' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken</ENAMEX> , to try to win health-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> also is testing home-delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken</ENAMEX> , which could be a hit with stay-at-home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> .
     But some fast-food industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say problems with keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">chicken</ENAMEX> warm and fresh must be solved <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued .
     He says the test is continuing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , and a few other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> will drop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Young &amp; Rubicam</ENAMEX> and seek a new ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> declines to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emanuel Goldman</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> will post an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> net income .
     `` They 've been laggard , '' he says , `` but they 'll have to become more aggressive . ''
     Reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Advertisers</ENAMEX> Try Soft-Sell Spots
     CALL IT un-advertising .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bear</ENAMEX> is selling a soft approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> who want exposure yet shun pushy ads .
     His ploy : <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-second</TIMEX> radio spots that offer helpful hints .
     The only plug for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsor</ENAMEX> is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
     The messages resemble the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Business Traveler</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> dose of travel tips developed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bear</ENAMEX> and sponsored by travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> in several major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     New <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">un-advertisers</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Butler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     Its radio series features such spots as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Building a Place to Park .</ENAMEX> ''
     A harder sell , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kosar</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , would `` detract from the profession . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOSPITAL">Hospitals</ENAMEX> have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Equitable Gas Co.</ENAMEX> is considering the format to offer energy tips to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
     But such spots can be too soft . `` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ketchum Advertising USA</ENAMEX> , which created similar radio spots for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pittsburgh National Bank</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Retailer</ENAMEX> Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
     HERE 'S a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailer</ENAMEX> that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Bear Supermarkets Inc.</ENAMEX> , a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> , plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment .
     The choices will be based on research by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">San Diego Environmental Health Coalition</ENAMEX> and will include products like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Murphy 's Oil Soap</ENAMEX> and other noncorrosive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">cleaners</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements .
     For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> and puts <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sunlight</ENAMEX> on its environmentally safe list .
     That does n't thrill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cascade</ENAMEX> dishwasher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergent</ENAMEX> .
     A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> questioned the validity of the list , noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chlorine</ENAMEX> is present in all major dishwasher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">detergents</ENAMEX> .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lever Bros.</ENAMEX> confirms that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Sunlight</ENAMEX> brand does contain chlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bleach</ENAMEX> , even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas G. Dahlen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Bear</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems .
     `` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says .
     `` And it 's important that we be accurate . ''
     But in the end , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> ' wishes are what will prevail .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Bear</ENAMEX> does n't care for disposable diapers , which are n't biodegradable .
     Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> demand them .
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dahlen</ENAMEX> , `` We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with . ''
     Odds and Ends
     NEATNESS does count -- at least in the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> .
     A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Safeway 's Scanner Marketing Research</ENAMEX> shows soap sales climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket ... .

     The continuing series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics .
     Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobbies</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">National Association of Home Builders</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> -RRB- continue to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> for more special-interest spending .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Colton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , argues that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''
     There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1943</TIMEX> out of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization</ENAMEX> that made its name fighting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> proposal to take over all defense housing production .
     Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">association</ENAMEX> has been an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> , pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment .
     Yet on matters close to , er , home ...
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> budget has dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70 %</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , '' argues Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colton</ENAMEX> .
     `` We 've taken more than our fair share .
     I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ''
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> has backed a host of public programs .
     It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures .
     Moreover , explains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> remains susceptible to internal pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that specialize in subsidized production .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">association</ENAMEX> is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 15 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> .
     It would like to peg the ceiling on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> mortgage guarantees to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 101,250</NUMEX> ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Veterans Affairs Department</ENAMEX> loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Farmers Home Administration</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FmHA</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">housing</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> in block grants to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">McKinney Act</ENAMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 656 million</NUMEX> potpourri for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> .
     Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">developers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobbyists</ENAMEX> , as demonstrated by the ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> .
     Indirect subsidies , through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> , for instance , are little better .
     Though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colton</ENAMEX> says expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> lending would result in `` no cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .
     More important , housing programs run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FmHA</ENAMEX> are awash in red ink .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> alone lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1988</TIMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's equity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.9 billion</NUMEX> .
     The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has had to pump in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.28 billion</NUMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA</ENAMEX> housing program since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> to keep the fund afloat and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">VA</ENAMEX> requested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $ 120 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> just ended .
     All told , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> already guarantees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 900 billion</NUMEX> of mortgages .
     In its nicely produced publication `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Where Will Our Children Live ?</ENAMEX> '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> . ''
     It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> has suggested actions that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">association</ENAMEX> has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">association</ENAMEX> , a majority of whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">members</ENAMEX> build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 25</NUMEX> units a year , is like many other business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobbies</ENAMEX> .
     Explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheila MacDonald</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Taxpayers Union</ENAMEX> : `` It treads in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> worlds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">builders</ENAMEX> like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">conservatives</ENAMEX> in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . ''
     Unfortunately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization</ENAMEX> 's desire for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> lobbied for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19 billion</NUMEX> omnibus housing bill , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">organization</ENAMEX> `` basically dropped out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">coalition</ENAMEX> , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacDonald</ENAMEX> .
     As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colton</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">NAHB</ENAMEX> acknowledges : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Government</ENAMEX> is not going to solve the problem ... .
     The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
     More money for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">municipalities</ENAMEX> that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .
     Is this what the home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">builders</ENAMEX> want ?

     In an attempt to give new momentum to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> plans for a single currency , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> 's founding <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Rome</ENAMEX> .
     According to diplomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Brussels</ENAMEX> , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> agree that talks should begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second half of 1990</TIMEX> , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 8</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">9</TIMEX> .
     The only strong opposition to changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> treaty comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> , who is opposed to creating a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> currency .
     But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .
     Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Mitterrand</ENAMEX> fought to set a date for the conference during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Madrid</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> .

     When asked `` What went wrong ? '' the unfortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> replied , `` It was a combination of things . ''
     And so it was on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grand marshal</ENAMEX> of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage .
     Even if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout -LRB- e -RRB- .
     The ceremonies began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when word spread that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out was collapsing .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">union-bidder</ENAMEX> expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> confirmed a growing fear among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .
     Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> tightness ; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax .
     As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">band</ENAMEX> of program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write .
     What really spooked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday</ENAMEX> reflects a panic mainly by the takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> , rather than the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing .
     Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , which triggered the slide , opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 224</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's close .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> 's close .
     -LRB- Both took further hits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> lost almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 %</NUMEX> .
     A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target</ENAMEX> 's stock price was not affected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX> prospects , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder</ENAMEX> must line up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">consortium</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and\/or issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated .
     The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's dramatic march for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several weeks</TIMEX> .
     The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resorts International</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Integrated Resources</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> 's retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX> and by forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .
     As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> planning to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11 billion</NUMEX> in junk bonds before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-end</TIMEX> are experiencing anxious times .
     These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in .
     Of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> had n't been silent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days</TIMEX> leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday</ENAMEX> , what are the implications for policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> ?
     After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> .
     Is this a case where private markets are approving of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's bashing of Wall Street ?
     Absolutely not .
     To the extent that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .
     The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> be the ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .
     The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
     If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealmakers</ENAMEX> become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions .
     Yes , the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all year</TIMEX> .
     Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> and takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">initiatiors</ENAMEX> got killed on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Gray Friday</ENAMEX> , while the besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">targets</ENAMEX> cheered lustily .
     If you identify with the besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     If you side with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX> , you clearly have more to fear from private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> than from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Delaware</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> should never be underestimated .
     The truth is , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> understands politics better than economics .
     Although the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> is probably not harmed too much from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .
     Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .
     Far better for policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to concentrate on the war against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> share prices rebounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> , with the Nikkei index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> selected stocks rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">618.69</NUMEX> points to close the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> session at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35087.38</NUMEX> .
     The index slid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647.33</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 25 minutes</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's trading the Nikkei index soared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">664.83</NUMEX> points , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35133.83</NUMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> time , the index was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.11</NUMEX> points , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34903.80</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> hailed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's overnight rally .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets .
     Shares also closed sharply lower across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> markets had sharper losses than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash .
     All eyes were on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> at the opening because it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major market to trade since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point plunge on Wall Street .
     But rather than set the tone for other markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's major institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> chose to remain on the sidelines .
     Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investment funds said they were n't planning to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> equities .
     `` We did n't trade much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Taisho Life Insurance Co .</ENAMEX>
     `` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> appeared confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regulators</ENAMEX> would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> was working behind the scenes to do just that .
     But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt .
     At the close , the Nikkei average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> stocks stood at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34468.69</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647.33</NUMEX> points , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> .
     The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45.66</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2600.88</NUMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> 's decline was generally in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' weekend predictions .
     Declining issues swamped advancers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">941</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> .
     But volume was thin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">526.2 million</NUMEX> shares , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">574.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 600</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</TIMEX> rebound brought it back to show a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX> at the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> session , but the rally failed in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> , and the market closed near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> 's low .
     The smaller stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section also posted their biggest decline of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyo Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> index for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100.96</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3655.40</NUMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , trying to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent weeks</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> expressed relief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market did n't fall more sharply .
     But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> global stock market crash .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 16 , 1987</TIMEX> -- the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> crash -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> market dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> followed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> drop .
     This time , Wall Street 's plunge of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> was followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 %</NUMEX> loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's biggest fall came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.6 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Black Monday</ENAMEX> plunge , when the Nikkei average fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.9 %</NUMEX> .
     Thus , market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening .
     But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</NUMEX> to close at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657.38</NUMEX> on heavy volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416,290,000</NUMEX> shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuto Yasuda</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamaichi Investment Trust &amp; Management Co.</ENAMEX> , called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's session `` a good scenario '' for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     `` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , '' he said .
     `` For us institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> , the chance for buying has come . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isao Ushikubo</ENAMEX> , general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the investment research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyo Trust &amp; Banking Co.</ENAMEX> , also was optimistic .
     He described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
     `` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> , '' he said .
     `` Those shares which had posted gains on M&amp;A speculation were dashed with cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''
     Other fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> were similarly sanguine . `` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masato Murakami</ENAMEX> , chief portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> in the pension fund management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co .</ENAMEX>
     He said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yasuda Trust</ENAMEX> plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy .
     Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">Pacific</ENAMEX> markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> had the biggest losses , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> composite index in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5 %</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> 's Straits Times Industrial Index down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     Major indexes declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 8 %</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">New Zealand</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bangkok</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seoul</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Taipei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jakarta</ENAMEX> escaped with slightly smaller losses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers</ENAMEX> and fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said the region 's markets were reacting to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market . `` It 's pure psychology , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Au Yeung</ENAMEX> , an account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
     `` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Asia</ENAMEX> is still following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's lead . ''
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have been staying away from it since it plunged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> amid political turmoil in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> . `` <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Singapore</ENAMEX> took the hit because when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Hambrecht</ENAMEX> , a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     She pointed out that even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> decline , the Straits Times index is up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who bailed out generally did so profitably .
     Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> 's composite index <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> ended <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.5 %</NUMEX> above its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> close .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , the Hang Seng Index fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180.60</NUMEX> to finish at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2601.70</NUMEX> .
     Trading was heavy at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one billion</NUMEX> shares , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473.9 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-day</TIMEX> closure after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chenevix-Trench</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baring International Fund Managers Ltd.</ENAMEX> , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
     `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> does n't collapse , I see maybe another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">China</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Australia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sydney</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">All Ordinaries</ENAMEX> index closed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1601.5</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.1 %</NUMEX> , its biggest drop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2163.4</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70.5</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2 %</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     We 've always thought that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> underestimated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's vitality , but maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .
     What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> and organized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> ?
     If passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> , the recently announced initiative would phase out major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> , ban new offshore drilling , ban <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> armed with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> budget to sue any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> he thinks is being too dirty .
     The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobby</ENAMEX> : the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">League of Conservation Voters</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">National Toxics Campaign</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Citizens for a Better Environment</ENAMEX> .
     Interestingly , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> is having nothing to do with this one .
     Not only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> but all <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> would pay if this thing passed .
     The initiative bars the sale of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">crops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> would have to adjust or give up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> market .
     In other words , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> is presuming to take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's farm policy .
     As usual the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobby</ENAMEX> 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality .
     Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .
     The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> .
     Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .
     But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> themselves will benefit .
     The key here is the ambition of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> .
     He 's running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 6 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     That 's also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> of the gubernatorial election .
     The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weepers</ENAMEX> who donate money .
     And it allows Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> to get around campaign spending limits .
     He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy .
     This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .
     -LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Wilson</ENAMEX> , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-
     While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> it could slide through .
     This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .
     If this new proposal ever does become law , the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">lobby</ENAMEX> will benefit directly .
     The initiative creates a free floating state environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> to sue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> or government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> that do things he does n't like .
     That means the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NRDC</ENAMEX> and such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">groups</ENAMEX> no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> would bear the cost .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">allies</ENAMEX> may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
     Of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> are not yet a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> unto themselves .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> who lost control of interstate commerce to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     And some other segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's less affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
     This grandiose initiative will help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> define itself for the future either as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la-la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> want to take it .

     First , there was a death watch .
     Then exhilaration .
     Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and erased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point plunge , gaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657.38</NUMEX> .
     It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-biggest advance for the average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> blue chips , on frenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416,290,000</NUMEX> shares -- the highest since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the days</TIMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     While the advance cheered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who feared a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX>-style crash would occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> and program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> .
     A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> outnumbered advancers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">975</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">749</NUMEX> , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> plunge .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> OTC index closed down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.31</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460.98</NUMEX> .
     Meanwhile , in a divergence in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the market 's most important indicators , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials ' sister average , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102.06</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1304.23</NUMEX> -- its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-worst decline next to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164.78</NUMEX>-point fall during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash .
     Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> airline stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , which each fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> when they reopened for trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> after being suspended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , the takeover stock at the center of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point market plunge , fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 7\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222 7\/8</NUMEX> on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3 million</NUMEX> shares . Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Cashin Jr.</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     `` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
     It 's just a strange feeling .
     I do n't think anyone left the place whistling <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Dixie</ENAMEX> . ''
     The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ''
     But to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , it looked like disaster on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 a.m.</TIMEX> opening bell .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.64</NUMEX> shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX> .
     But most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> blue-chip stocks in the average , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eastman Kodak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-afternoon</TIMEX> rout .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:45</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter &amp; Gamble</ENAMEX> -- one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bellwethers</ENAMEX> of late -- opened down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> dropped to a quick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>-point loss , and to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
     More stocks opened over the ensuing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</TIMEX> , as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> to match the selling flood .
     Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses .
     There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markets .
     This was a hangover from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard &amp; Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
     The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> would hold off until the market stabilized .
     They did n't .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> accelerated its slide , losing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63.52</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 40 minutes</TIMEX> of trading .
     With program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> seemingly in charge , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
     Then at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:15</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early-morning</TIMEX> fall .
     And this time , it was n't just the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who were responsible .
     All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and major money management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> started buying stocks heavily .
     The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were in there , too , of course .
     But according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain-hunting '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland M. Machold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Jersey Division of Investment</ENAMEX> , which oversees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29 billion</NUMEX> in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> .
     `` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</NUMEX> and put it in '' the market .
     Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> particularly caught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> ' eyes .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney</ENAMEX> had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> ; it was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> stocks that could n't finish trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> .
     The stock opened late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114 1\/2</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 1\/2</NUMEX> .
     But then it shot upward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 1\/2</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> stepped in and bought , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Disney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Fagenson</ENAMEX> said : `` I would be surprised if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> of the opening volume . ''
     Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , in contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's gridlock .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc.</ENAMEX> , head equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley Eppel</ENAMEX> said : `` I think the opening was constructive .
     It was orderly .
     We put some orders together .
     There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .
     Not like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ''
     Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were glum .
     But in another dramatic burst , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> tacked on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> , and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:25</TIMEX> the index showed a gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.74</NUMEX> .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> floor and on trading desks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> yelped their approval .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grinned Griffith Peck</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> 's OTC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ''
     Around him , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> seemed to get a burst of energy ; their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> broke out bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Perrier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> to cool them off .
     Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . `` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> .
     But not everybody was making money .
     The carnage on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> stock-index options was halted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Many market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&amp;P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> index options contract had bullish positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> , clearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> to get out of their positions at any cost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> . `` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> stocks mimic the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials , did n't lead <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's big rally .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gallagher</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> at specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fowler &amp; Rosenau</ENAMEX> , said , `` The difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> '' -- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Terrible Tuesday</ENAMEX> , '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 20 , 1987</TIMEX> -- `` is that then we needed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX> to go into the Major Market Index , spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</NUMEX> and get the program rally started .

     However , according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Terrible Tuesday</ENAMEX> . `` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Selkin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of stock-index futures research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was better than during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-afternoon</TIMEX> chaos , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> who work with them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Specialists</ENAMEX> were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> plunge . But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck</ENAMEX> , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eppel</ENAMEX> , who had been critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> ' performance on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> issues -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Valero Energy</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merck</ENAMEX> is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
     No sector of the market has been spared during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two days</TIMEX> ' gyrations .
     Yet from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials ' high on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 9</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> and life insurance stocks .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues .
     For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Halliburton</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Schlumberger</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1\/4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baker Hughes</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> .
     Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AMR</ENAMEX> tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's most active issue , rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1\/4</NUMEX> on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight million</NUMEX> shares .
     Among other major issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> closed up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 3\/4</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7 million</NUMEX> shares and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> , which reported earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , finished at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , after slipping below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's session for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     Shares of three brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> rose after they reported earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 1\/2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 1\/4</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> , a recently hot stock , climbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> on nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6 million</NUMEX> shares .
     At a news conference after the close of trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> and other exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> praised the performance of their computers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent months</TIMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 24 million</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100 million</NUMEX> shares traded in the final <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program-related , he said .
     Program trades make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's volume on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">an average day</TIMEX> , but despite the increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> expressed relief that the market rebounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     `` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said .
     He said that exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had conversations with Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> and that `` all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> behaved very , very responsibly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> . ''
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of retail equity trading , praised institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> in the OTC market , who were heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's biggest technology issues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> amid a flood of selling by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> . `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> said in an interview .
     `` It was the opposite of what happened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 19</TIMEX> .
     They used their judgment .
     They did n't panic during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of selling <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> .
     Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly .
     Maybe they learned from experience . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's plunge was admirable , because out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,640</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> common stocks traded during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> were closed and were n't reopened before the close . `` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> .

     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and on all flights of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> or less to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> .
     The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> or less .
     The exemption allowed on longer flights to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">recent years</TIMEX> .
     By a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> margin , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> initially rejected <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> provision covering all domestic flights .
     But the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six-hour</TIMEX> compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .
     As a practical matter , flights from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">West Coast</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">East Coast</ENAMEX> .
     Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , the ban has had aggressive support from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lautenberg</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who has used his position as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Appropriations</ENAMEX> subcommittee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> to garner votes for the initiative .
     The measure is attached to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 26 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> transportation bill within Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lautenberg</ENAMEX> 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 205 million</NUMEX> in road projects earmarked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as well as funds sought by major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> .
     From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow .
     But the industry retains support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> through the influence of grower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> .
     Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gray</ENAMEX> owes a political debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> agriculture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> for his rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
     Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Illinois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> who had voted against the panel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> floor . `` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lehman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> .
     `` But if you make a request , you should support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> . ''
     Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> , the final bill promises to increase spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> and equipment by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , and total operations would rise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.84 billion</NUMEX> -- a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> boost .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> account includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> 's ambitious new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airport</ENAMEX> , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> representing established <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> .
     Leery of the costs -- and , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say , competition -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> have sought to gain leverage over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Air Transport Association</ENAMEX> were prominent in the lobbying .
     The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Denver</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airlines</ENAMEX> had agreed to leases for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of the gates .
     But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2 billion</NUMEX> .
     Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 30.6 million</NUMEX> in controversial subsidies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">carriers</ENAMEX> serving rural or isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> .
     The sum is more than double what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> had approved for the program , but the list of qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> would be cut by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> previously cut <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:AIRPORT">airports</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has been paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 200</NUMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> in subsidies .
     Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 615 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 85 million</NUMEX> for capital improvements .
     And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.625 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last fiscal year</TIMEX> .

     The results for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> were worse than market expectations , which suggested an interim loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 10 million Irish punts</NUMEX> .
     In a sharply weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Waterford</ENAMEX> shares were down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 pence</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 pence</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 cents</NUMEX> -RRB- .

     The sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's explosive bond-market rally was reversed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in a `` flight from quality '' rout .
     The setback , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking .
     `` It was a pretty wild day .
     Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Kazis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Smith Barney , Harris Upham &amp; Co</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , '' he said .
     Some fixed-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> had expected a further drop in stock prices after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     That caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to flee stocks and buy high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
     But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds declined .
     Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
     Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 1\/2 %</NUMEX> .
     The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , slid to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> , down from its perceived target level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 9 %</NUMEX> .
     The rate is considered an early signal of changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> policy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .
     In fact , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> contend that the latest easing started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> .
     Others note that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond , ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 3\/4</NUMEX> points lower , or down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 17.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities .
     After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bill rates plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 0.70</NUMEX> percentage point on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , they gave back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-fourths</NUMEX> of that amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The bond-equivalent yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills , for example , was quoted late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.72 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.16 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
     But prices of junk bonds , which were battered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
     Junk bonds opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as four</NUMEX> points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying .
     In particular , they said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels . `` I think the willingness of securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lonski</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were higher in overnight trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , which opened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 7:30 p.m. EDT</TIMEX> .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond , for example rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point in early <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading in reaction to a quick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>-point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stock market .
     But as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , wanting to keep a watchful eye on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> trading as an indication of where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading would begin , were fully staffed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> trading session . `` Most of the action was during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> session , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore</ENAMEX> , trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger</ENAMEX> , who often trades overnight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Capital Insight Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , said trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> was `` very active '' but highly volatile .
     `` We went down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> point in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> right before lunch , then after lunch we went up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/4</NUMEX> point in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> , '' he said .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , trading is halted during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading .
     When the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength .
     The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that it overshadowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's slate of economic data , which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> merchandise trade and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> industrial production .
     Industrial production is expected to have declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> , according to a consensus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones Capital Markets Report</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> trade deficit is expected to have widened to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.1 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.58 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     A widening of that magnitude , said one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , is `` not a favorable number ... .
     It could do damage to us . ''
     Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Home Loan Bank</ENAMEX> prices a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.3 billion</NUMEX> offering of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one-year</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five-year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> maturities .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> will provide details of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bond issue , which is expected to total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion</NUMEX> and carry a maturity greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Funding</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , the new federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> created to bail out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .

     `` There 's lots of supply , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We have a couple or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three tough weeks</TIMEX> coming . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond was quoted late at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 19\/32</NUMEX> , compared with a closing price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 12\/32</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .

     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes were quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 3\/32</NUMEX> for a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.97 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 9\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.84 %</NUMEX> .
     Short-term interest rates fell <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bill auction .
     The average discount rate on new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.37 %</NUMEX> , the lowest since the average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.36 %</NUMEX> at the auction on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 17 , 1988</TIMEX> .

     Here are auction details :
     Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
     Thus , higher bidding narrows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's return while lower bidding widens it .
     The percentage rates are calculated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 360-day year</TIMEX> , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 365-day year</TIMEX> .

     There were no new issues .
     Foreign Bonds
     Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies .

     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     Mortgage securities gave up most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's gains as active issues ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24\/32 to 30\/32</NUMEX> point lower .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities , but trading slowed to moderate levels in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery were quoted late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 4\/32</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30\/32</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 1\/2 %</NUMEX> securities were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27\/32</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 5\/32</NUMEX> ; and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 2\/32</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24\/32</NUMEX> .

     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> , mortgage issues gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 1 5\/32</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Late yesterday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities were yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.39 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> note narrowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.42</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said there were some busy dealings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> securities because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals .
     Offsetting the Remic-related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">originators</ENAMEX> , which are producing increased amounts of fixed-rate mortgage-backed issues with lower rates .
     There was no new-issue activity in the derivative market .
     Municipals
     Rebounding stocks and weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> prices drove municipal bonds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4 to 3\/4</NUMEX> point lower in late dealings .
     The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> prompted a capital markets rally .
     Trading was hectic during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> trying to gauge whether equities would continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness .
     Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1987</TIMEX> crash was n't at hand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professionals</ENAMEX> dominated municipal trading throughout the session .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market .
