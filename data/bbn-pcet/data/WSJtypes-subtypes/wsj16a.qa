     When it comes to buying and selling shares , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westridge Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> takes a back seat to no one .
     Every dollar 's worth of stock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manager</ENAMEX> 's portfolio is traded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> times a year , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> estimates .
     That makes it the most active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> among all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advisers</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filings .
     But wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westridge Capital</ENAMEX> is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westridge Capital</ENAMEX> 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
     Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index , and match its performance .
     Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> have poured <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 210 billion</NUMEX> into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
     These big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickers</ENAMEX> have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it .
     And the fees <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> pay for indexing run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few pennies</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> .
     That 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
     Because index-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are no longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as three</NUMEX> percentage points .
     `` Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth M. Lynn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axe Core Investors Inc.</ENAMEX> , an indexer based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tarrytown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y .</ENAMEX>
     `` Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money . ''
     Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of stocks , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few dozen</NUMEX> , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , those paying high dividends or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in a particular industry , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
     Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 .
     `` There is n't a boatload -LCB- of big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -RCB- out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. James Kartalia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">ANB Investment Management Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , which offers both indexing and active management services .
     -LRB- After tripling in size in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past five years</TIMEX> , index funds now hold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> of the stock owned by pension funds . -RRB-
     A further problem is razor-thin profits .
     Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that .
     To land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for their well-paying stock custodial business , big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
     `` It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Axe Core</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn</ENAMEX> .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX> have been looking for ways to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> something more than the average for their money .
     And many have been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westridge Capital</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westridge Capital</ENAMEX> has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 to 3</NUMEX> percentage points over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past four years</TIMEX> , with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Carder</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     Strategies vary for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Westridge Capital</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> under management .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carder</ENAMEX> also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
     And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some months</TIMEX> , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
     `` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carder</ENAMEX> adds .
     `` The more turnover , the better for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> . ''
     Big indexer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Thomas Allen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advanced Investment Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
     `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX> make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` If the futures markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Zumbrunn</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Investment Index Technologies Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5\/100</NUMEX> of a percentage point .
     An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> .
     There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds .
     They include :
     LIMITED RISK FUNDS :
     These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
     Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95</NUMEX> of every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> invested for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> , even if the market goes much lower .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">fund</ENAMEX> could invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 87</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> to return the guaranteed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95</NUMEX> .
     That leaves <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 13</NUMEX> , which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">S&P</ENAMEX> index .
     MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS :
     Say a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> is interested in growth stocks .
     Instead of hiring one of the many active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">managers</ENAMEX> specializing in growth stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX> can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- .
     `` We see a lot of interest in those kind of things , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Salerno</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . ''
     TILT FUNDS :
     This is an index fund with a bet .
     Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> considered bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidates</ENAMEX> ; this can avoid weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sisters</ENAMEX> , but also can hurt when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> rebounds .
     Another approach : An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> might use <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> on a favorite group of stocks .
     SPECIALIZED FUNDS :
     Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> doing business in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Africa</ENAMEX> .
     Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX> , for example , has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 130 million</NUMEX> invested in a fund of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">244</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that are either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>-based or have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> of their work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .

     Short interest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> declined for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second consecutive month</TIMEX> , this time <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2 %</NUMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its third consecutive record month</TIMEX> of short interest .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> reported that short interest dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">523,920,214</NUMEX> shares as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">547,347,585</NUMEX> shares in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-September</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> short interest climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53,496,665</NUMEX> shares from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51,911,566</NUMEX> shares .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier month</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">461,539,056</NUMEX> shares , indicating a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> rise , while the Amex reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,015,194</NUMEX> shares , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</NUMEX> leap .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amex</ENAMEX> short interest has been heading upward since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-December</TIMEX> , with increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each month</TIMEX> since then except at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">mid-July</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
     Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">lenders</ENAMEX> .
     Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
     Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
     The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
     The level of negative sentiment measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> short interest ratio slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.36</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.38</NUMEX> .
     The ratio is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">trading days</TIMEX> , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Varity Corp.</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> list of largest short volumes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,822,563</NUMEX> shares .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Waste Management</ENAMEX> posted the biggest increase in short volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> exchange , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,383,477</NUMEX> shares to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,267,238</NUMEX> .

     You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
     My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
     Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his years</TIMEX> of involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">narcotics</ENAMEX> smuggling -LRB- and simultaneous work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> operative -RRB- .
     The public made up its mind about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988</TIMEX> , and again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 4 , 1988</TIMEX> .
     It was during those hearings that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> first learned the breadth and depth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     Those hearings also highlighted how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was able to use his relationships with these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> to delay <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> action against him , and to exploit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> 's obsession with overthrowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> to protect his own drug-dealing .
     As former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis J. McNeil</ENAMEX> testified before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> knew that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">narcotics</ENAMEX> , but made a decision in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer of 1986</TIMEX> `` to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> on the shelf until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> was settled . ''
     As the report issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> concluded , `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> did nothing regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Contra</ENAMEX> war .
     This decision resulted in at least some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> as a hidden cost of the war . ''
     Unfortunately , this problem continued even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> 's indictment .

     After years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1986</TIMEX> , but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy .
     Here is how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> are coping with change :
     The Tire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Van Chan</ENAMEX> is living proof that old ways die hard .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> used to be an oddity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hanoi</ENAMEX> : a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> .
     His business success made him an official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">pre-reform days</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan </ENAMEX>, now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">64 years old</TIMEX> , invented a fountain pen he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> produced from plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">waste</ENAMEX> .
     Later , he marketed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glue</ENAMEX> .
     Both products were immensely popular .
     For his troubles , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> was jailed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">between 1960 and 1974</TIMEX> .
     Though his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">materials</ENAMEX> .
     Once he was held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> without being charged .
     Things were supposed to change when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did .
     After years of experimenting , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> , he was selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of tires .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Newspapers</ENAMEX> published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> . ''
     His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> .
     District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> descended on his suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , which he and his large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> used as both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">residence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> , and demanded proof the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> and equipment were his .
     He produced it .
     `` That was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time they lost and I won , '' he says .
     He was further questioned to determine if he was `` a real working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exploiter</ENAMEX> . ''
     Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan </ENAMEX>: `` When I showed it was from my own brain , they lost for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time . ''
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few days later</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
     Warned he was to be jailed again , he fled to the countryside .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was given <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> to leave before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> and contents were confiscated .
     With only the clothes they were wearing , family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> moved to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> owned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> on the run , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> learned the order for his arrest had been canceled .
     He rejoined his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1984</TIMEX> and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hanoi</ENAMEX> municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Assembly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> for restoration of his rights .
     He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> kept afloat by repairing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bicycles</ENAMEX> , selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit</ENAMEX> and doing odd jobs .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> achieved a breakthrough in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> -- and became a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> again -- when his story was published in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> newspaper .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">18 months</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">congress</ENAMEX> formally endorsed family-run private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">enterprise</ENAMEX> , district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> allowed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> to resume work .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last year</TIMEX> he was invited back as `` the tire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> '' to display his products at a national exhibition .
     National <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> stopped by his stand to commend his achievements .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> now produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> bicycle and motorbike tires a month and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> tins of tire-patching <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glue</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> 's small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pack the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">rooms</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chans</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> .
     Most sleep on the floor .
     Come daybreak , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> unroll a sheet of raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">rubber</ENAMEX> that covers the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> and spills out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> .
     The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">courtyard</ENAMEX> , where an ancient press squeezes rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">solution</ENAMEX> into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> talks optimistically of expanding , maybe even moving into the import-export field .
     First , however , he has unfinished business .
     When district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> allowed him to resume manufacturing , they released <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of his machines .
     They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital . Nor did they return his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> and contents , which he values at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 44,000</NUMEX> .
     He wants to recover more than just his property , though .
     `` I want my dignity back , '' he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Ngoc</ENAMEX> seemed an obvious choice when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Vietnamese Writers Association</ENAMEX> was looking for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> to reform its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> .
     After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">congress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57 years old</TIMEX> , had solid reformist credentials : He had lost his official position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">he early 1980s</TIMEX> because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature .
     Appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1987</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc</ENAMEX> rapidly turned the staid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's hottest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> .
     Circulation soared as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">weekly</ENAMEX> went way beyond standard literary themes to cover <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> society and its ills .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> were electrified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> article recounted a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decade</TIMEX>-long struggle by a wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> to prove , officially , he was alive .
     Another described how tax-collection <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Thanh Hoa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> stormed through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and confiscated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> from starving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> also ran a series of controversial short stories by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Huy Thiep</ENAMEX> , a former history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> , who stirred debate over his interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who had blocked his entry into their official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">association</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> quickly made influential enemies .
     `` Those who manage ideology and a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> reacted badly '' to the restyled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai Nguyen An</ENAMEX> , a literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> .
     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> of internal rumblings , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc</ENAMEX> was fired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last December</TIMEX> .
     His dismissal triggered a furor among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> that continues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     `` Under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ngoc </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Van Nghe</ENAMEX> protected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Duy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> who is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> 's bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> for southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> reflected the truth .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> , that was too painful to bear . ''
     The ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Billionaire</ENAMEX> '
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Thi Thi</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> .
     Her challenge is to keep her fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> on top in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> did n't wait for the reforms to get her start .
     She charged ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> and the law to establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hochiminh City Food Co.</ENAMEX> as the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">dealer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Her success , which included alleviating an urban food shortage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , helped persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hanoi</ENAMEX> to take the reform path .
     Her story is becoming part of local folklore .
     A lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> with little education who fought both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX>-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Saigon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> , she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war .
     Her instincts were capitalistic , despite her background .
     As she rode over regulations , only her friendship with party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen Van Linh</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ho Chi Minh City</ENAMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , kept her out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">jail</ENAMEX> .
     Following Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linh</ENAMEX> 's appointment as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary-general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">congress</ENAMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> has become the darling of `` doi moi '' , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> version of perestroika .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have steered foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> to her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> to see an example of `` the new way of thinking . ''
     Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">publications</ENAMEX> have responded with articles declaring her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> .
     `` Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> call me the communist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> , '' she has told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> .
     Actually , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">67-year-old</TIMEX> Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">land</ENAMEX> .
     She has indeed turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hochiminh City Food</ENAMEX> into a budding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">conglomerate</ENAMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> itself remains state-owned .
     She manages it with the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general-director</ENAMEX> .
     The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">business</ENAMEX> is the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> and other commodities , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">corn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">coffee</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in the south , paying with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">fertilizer</ENAMEX> , farm tools and other items .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hochiminh City Food</ENAMEX> says it bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">two million metric tons</NUMEX> of unhusked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's output .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> operates a fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boats</ENAMEX> to transport the commodities to its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">warehouses</ENAMEX> .
     A subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> processes commodities into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">foods</ENAMEX> such as instant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">noodles</ENAMEX> that are sold with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">rice</ENAMEX> through a vast retail network .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> has started to diversify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> , taking a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake in newly established , partly private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Industrial and Commercial Bank</ENAMEX> , and setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saigon Petro</ENAMEX> , which owns and operates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thi</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Hochiminh City Food</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> increased pretax profit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> to the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.7 million</NUMEX> on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> .
     She expects both revenue and profit to gain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     She is almost cavalier about the possibility <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's reforms will create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> on her home turf .
     `` I do n't mind the competition inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , '' she says .
     `` I am only afraid that with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital Corp.</ENAMEX> reported a net loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine cents</NUMEX> a share , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">its first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> , citing factors as varied as hurricane damage , an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .

     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> itself was n't damaged , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first-quarter</TIMEX> revenue were lost .
     The revenue will be regained in the current period , he added .
     There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said , explaining that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> continues to believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> are best served by reinvesting excess cash .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first-quarter</TIMEX> loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> does n't make the monitors .
     An accelerating move by personal computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> 's equipment .
     `` The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array , VGA , graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter , EGA , which has a lower resolution standard , technology and now is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> of these newer units .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift , he said , `` but we were able to respond much more quickly . ''
     Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said , `` our stock is grossly undervalued . ''
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has cut operating expenses by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the last few quarters</TIMEX> , while maintaining research and development at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 % to 9 %</NUMEX> of sales .
     As part of its reorganization <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> has divided its business into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segments</ENAMEX> -- storage products , including controllers and disk drives ; and microcomputer products , which include graphics , communications and peripheral control chips .
     Graphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
     Storage , which includes computer controllers and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">3.5-inch</NUMEX> disk drives , represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's business .
     Disk drives , which allow a computer to access its memory , generated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</NUMEX> more revenue in the most recent period compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal first quarter a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Computer parts are getting ever smaller , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said , a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business .
     As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> is strengthening development of laptop parts .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> plans to consolidate its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Irvine</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> and , a block away , a modern <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100 million</NUMEX> silicon wafer fabrication <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     The plan will help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital 's</ENAMEX> business is overseas , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> expects that proportion to continue .
     Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> creates significant opportunities for the company , he said , particularly since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> already manufactures there .
     Capitalizing on that presence , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Western Digital</ENAMEX> is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> of state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ENAMEX> approved a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> .
     Until now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BNL</ENAMEX> 's top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> have been appointed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> decree .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director general</ENAMEX> , who also sit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">board</ENAMEX> , still would be appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BNL</ENAMEX> , which is controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> , was rocked by the disclosure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> that its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> extended <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 3 billion</NUMEX> in unauthorized credits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
     The ensuing scandal , in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> 's banking system , which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</NUMEX> state-controlled .
     In a related move , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> 's new shareholding structure .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BNL</ENAMEX> called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ' assembly meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> to vote on the proposals .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">BNL</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 75,000</NUMEX> nonvoting shares that are listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Milan Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
     The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> scandal ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Consob</ENAMEX> , the stock exchange regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">body</ENAMEX> , reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension .

     Per-share net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66 cents</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72 cents</NUMEX> , fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business , lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets .
     Net was aided by a lower income tax rate .

     A federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> of rivets .

     But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1988</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 251 million</NUMEX> claim stems from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> jury award in a case stemming from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> ' alleged attempts to corner the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1979-80</TIMEX> silver market .

     Although the proposal must be approved by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold C. Abramson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> is considering it , although his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> , which claims the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> owe <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> in back taxes and is by far the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">creditor</ENAMEX> in both cases .
     The tentative agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> is awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Justice Department</ENAMEX> approval .
     Under it , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> 's assets would be liquidated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> getting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> , which is seeking repayment of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36 million</NUMEX> loan .
     A similiar proposal has been made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.

     In both cases , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pie</ENAMEX> .
     With support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> has filed suit asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> to subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> 's claim to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturer Hanover</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has threatened a `` volcano '' of litigation if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> unit attempts to force such a plan through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gorman</ENAMEX> decribed the plan as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step toward an overall settlement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.

     Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.07 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> , the sharpest increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">almost two years</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473</NUMEX> funds tracked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Investment Company Institute</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX>-based trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> , rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 356.1 billion</NUMEX> , a record .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.07 billion</NUMEX> increase was the strongest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> inflow since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1988</TIMEX> .
     The increase was spread fairly evenly among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> types of funds .
     Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> and put the money into funds , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Dreyer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Institute</ENAMEX> .

     Yields on money funds dropped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week ended Tuesday</TIMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donoghue 's Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Holliston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , newsletter .

     Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd.</ENAMEX> 's most recent spate of financial troubles , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Basir Ismail</ENAMEX> , said .
     Speaking to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Bumiputra</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> approved a rescue plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Sri Basir</ENAMEX> said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> when property prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> plummeted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1984-85</TIMEX> .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> to service their loans .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> decided to make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.23 billion Malaysian dollars</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 457 million</NUMEX> -RRB- in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , and to submit a bailout package to replenish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's paid-up capital .
     The predicament , he added , was similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1982-83</TIMEX> property-price collapse , which exposed the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Bumiputra</ENAMEX> 's former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">colony</ENAMEX> in the largest banking scandal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's history .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd.</ENAMEX> , was left with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M$ 2.26 billion</NUMEX> in bad loans made to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> .
     Both episodes wiped out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Bumiputra</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> ' funds .
     Each time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shareholder</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petroliam Nasional Bhd.</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Petronas</ENAMEX> , the national oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">company</ENAMEX> -- has been called upon to rescue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institution</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Petronas</ENAMEX> , which became the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">shareholder</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> rescue exercise , has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about M$ 3.5 billion</NUMEX> to prop up the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Sri Basir</ENAMEX> said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capital Issues Committee</ENAMEX> and central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">High Court</ENAMEX> is expected to approve the plan .
     Once the plan is approved , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Sri Basir</ENAMEX> said , most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank Bumiputra</ENAMEX> 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> will be on track to report a pretax profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between M$ 160 million and M$ 170 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal year ending March 31</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous financial year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> would have reported a pretax profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M$ 168 million</NUMEX> if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans , he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Banking Secrecy Act</ENAMEX> prohibited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> from identifying delinquent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Sri Basir</ENAMEX> .
     But public documents indicate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> or more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M$ 200 million</NUMEX> loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Malaysia</ENAMEX> 's dominant political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">party</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">United Malays National Organization</ENAMEX> , to build its convention and headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> .
     The loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">UMNO</ENAMEX> was made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September 1983</TIMEX> .
     `` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Sri Basir</ENAMEX> , who refused to discuss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's outstanding loans to
     As well as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M$ 1.23 billion</NUMEX> in provisions announced on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 6</TIMEX> , the restructuring package covers <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional M$ 450 million</NUMEX> in provisions made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier years</TIMEX> but never reflected in a reduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's paid-up capital .
     At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Petronas</ENAMEX> will increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's paid-up capital to M$ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.15 billion</NUMEX> after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Ehman</ENAMEX> might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">24 years old</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> in her church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> , she symbolizes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that gave its heart and its vote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> .
     `` I felt kind of safe , '' she says .
     No longer .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> opened the door <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> to new restrictions on abortion , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehman</ENAMEX> opened her mind to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> politics .
     Then a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX> , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers .
     Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Passaic County</ENAMEX> for pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> gubernatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Florio</ENAMEX> .
     `` This is one where I cross party lines , '' she says , rejecting the anti-abortion stance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Courter</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> my age thought it was n't going to be an issue .
     Now it has -- especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> my age . ''
     Polls bear out this warning , but after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> of increased <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> .
     Unless he closes the gap , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> risk losing not only the governorship but also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">assembly</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> .
     Going into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> in the past .
     This change comes less from a shift in public opinion , which has n't changed much on abortion over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> , than in the boundaries of the debate .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> 's own highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Missouri</ENAMEX> , has engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> who had been insulated from the issue .
     Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> , pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion .
     Now , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> .
     A recent pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rally</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Trenton</ENAMEX> drew <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> , and in a major reversal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is defying a presidential veto and demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest .
     `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> had n't happened , you would n't be here , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Bowker</ENAMEX> tells a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Trenton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Organization for Women </ENAMEX>.
     `` We could have shouted from the rooftops about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> ... and no one would have heard us . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> is a proving ground for this aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s-rights movement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     The infusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> can bring a clash of cultures .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cherry Hill</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Abortion Rights Action League</ENAMEX> , whose goal is to sign up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> , targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause .
     The league <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> seem more a fit with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convention</ENAMEX> next door of young aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> in leotards than the beefy union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> ; `` I wish I could go work out , '' says a slim <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> .
     A labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> speaks sardonically of having to `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Election Day</TIMEX> phones .
     No age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is more sensitive than younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> , like Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehman </ENAMEX>.
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago this fall</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">under 30</TIMEX> favored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 %</NUMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX> , according to a survey then by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Rutgers University</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Eagleton Institute</ENAMEX> .
     A matching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Eagleton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Newark Star Ledger</ENAMEX> poll <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> showed a complete reversal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> in the same age <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:RELIGIOUS">group</ENAMEX> backed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 %</NUMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> .
     Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> .
     By a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> appear more at ease with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are specifically linked to the issue .
     `` The times are my times , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio </ENAMEX>.
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Camden County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> still carries himself with a trademark `` I'm-coming-down-your-throat '' intensity , but at a pause in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Newark</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Columbus Day parade</ENAMEX> recently , he was dancing with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">avenue</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> 's old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ward .
     After losing by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 1,800</NUMEX> votes in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicaid</ENAMEX> abortions .
     `` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who can drive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hospital</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">clinic</ENAMEX> in a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> who defended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> before national cameras at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> .
     It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate .
     `` He does n't know himself , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Stanwick</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Abortion Rights League</ENAMEX> says of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's position .
     Even abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> , however angry with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> , ca n't hide their frustration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> 's ambivalence .
     `` He does n't want to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Traynor </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New Jersey Right to Life</ENAMEX> .
     Moreover , by stepping outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's pro-choice tradition , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment .
     He hurt himself further <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> by bringing homosexual issues into the debate ; and by wavering on this issue and abortion , he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides .
     Elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1978</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">48-year-old</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> is part of a generation of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan </ENAMEX>.
     Like many of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> , he did n't serve in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> resolution critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> mining of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Nicaraguan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">harbors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Kristol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gilder</ENAMEX> were influences , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kean</ENAMEX> , in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> primary here .
     The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Warren County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> 's budget in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">his eight years</TIMEX> in office .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> forces play down any differences with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> , but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean </ENAMEX>'s own insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
     Fluent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">his days</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> actively courts minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> but seems oddly over his head .
     He is warm and polished before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Puerto Rican Congress</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Asbury Park</ENAMEX> .
     Yet <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after promising to appoint <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Hispanics</ENAMEX> to high posts in state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't think we do now , '' he says .
     `` I think we did . ''
     Asked the same question after his appearance , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> identifies a staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> by name and explains her whereabouts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     When he is presented with a poster celebrating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organization</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20th</NUMEX> anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> and recalls time spent together in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Camden</ENAMEX> .
     Details and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Camden</ENAMEX> are essential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> .
     Elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> as a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Watergate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> '' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1974</TIMEX> , he ran for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years later</TIMEX> .
     In the opinion of many , he has n't stopped running since , even though he declined a rematch with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> .
     His base in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South Jersey</ENAMEX> and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> helped him sustain a network of political-action <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committees</ENAMEX> to preserve his edge .
     With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's higher recognition than his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> is a major advantage .
     More than ever , his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     Auto insurance rates are soaring .
     A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">highway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Monmouth</ENAMEX> , an important swing area , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freeholders</ENAMEX> now run on a slogan promising to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> `` clean and green . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> savors this vindication , but at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age 52</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> is also a product of his times and losses .
     He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Exodus 21</ENAMEX> ; to increase state revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste .
     Hard-hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> match ads with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> retools himself as the lean , mean <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> fighting machine of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> .
     Appealing to a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> , he scraps an old reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Ozzie and Harriet</ENAMEX> and instead quotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Grateful Dead</ENAMEX> .
     The lyric chosen -- `` <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long strange night</TIMEX> '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> intended to portray each other as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liar</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmaker</ENAMEX> fits a pattern of younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> arising out of old machines , but his ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Camden</ENAMEX> remain a sore point because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">county</ENAMEX> 's past corruption .
     His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment , he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">alma mater</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Trenton State College</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> ruling divides some of his old constituency .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pasquale Pignatelli</ENAMEX> , an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">major</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Essex County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> bagpipe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">band</ENAMEX> , speaks sadly of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio </ENAMEX>.
     `` I am a devout <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Catholic</ENAMEX> , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pignatelli</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">40-year-old</TIMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> .
     `` I ca n't support him because of abortion . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Wames Sr.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">72</TIMEX> , is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Catholic</ENAMEX> too , but unfazed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> 's stand on abortion .
     A security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> at a cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">terminal</ENAMEX> , he wears a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Sons of Italy</ENAMEX> jacket and cap celebrating `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The US 1 Band</ENAMEX> . ''
     `` I still think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has the right to do with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> as she pleases , '' he says .

     Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported .
     Energy costs , which drove wholesale prices up sharply during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the month</TIMEX> , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs .
     The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news , closing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39.55</NUMEX> points higher at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2683.20</NUMEX> .
     Bond prices also jumped as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> were not nearly as jubilant .
     The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few months</TIMEX> , they warned .
     They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods .
     `` I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Popkin </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> on inflation who runs an economic consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> here .
     `` It has been in what I would describe as a lull for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past several months</TIMEX> . ''
     `` We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each of the past three months</TIMEX> , and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Woodworth</ENAMEX> , chief domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too .
     As a result , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did .
     But retail energy prices declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices , many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     Still , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
     `` It increasingly appears that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1987-88</TIMEX> was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Yardeni</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">both 1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , consumer prices rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</NUMEX> .
     A run-up in world oil prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last winter</TIMEX> sent consumer prices soaring at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first five months of this year</TIMEX> , but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate back down to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yardeni</ENAMEX> predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices .
     `` The bottom line is , it seems to me that the economic environment has become very , very competitve for a lot of businesses , '' he said .
     `` Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1987-88</TIMEX> , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> felt they could raise prices . ''
     Now , he said , a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand .
     The mild inflation figures renewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' hopes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> will ease its interest-rate stance .
     The steep climb in producer prices reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9 %</NUMEX> plunge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">that day</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past several days</TIMEX> , however , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bank</ENAMEX> has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:MUSEUM">makers</ENAMEX> have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy .
     Excluding the volatile categories of energy and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> -- leaving what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Transportation costs actually fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> , and housing costs gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.1 %</NUMEX> .
     Apparel prices rocketed up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</NUMEX> , but that was after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> of declines .
     Medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8 %</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four consecutive months</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> increases .
     Car prices , another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , still showed declines at the consumer level .
     They dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 %</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> continued to offer rebates to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Food prices rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second month in a row</TIMEX> , far slower than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> rises <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier in the year</TIMEX> .
     Separately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported that average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> earnings rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> , after adjusting for inflation , following a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 %</NUMEX> decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations .
     Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> 's consumer price index for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .

     After watching interest in the sport plummet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift .
     Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">resorts</ENAMEX> are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     Some have built health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spas</ENAMEX> , business <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">villages</ENAMEX> so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> have more to do than ski .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> , the industry 's efforts will go national for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time when it unveils a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 million</NUMEX> advertising campaign .
     Such efforts -- unheard of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only a few years ago</TIMEX> -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.76 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> ski industry .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of the decade</TIMEX> , lift-ticket sales have grown <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3 %</NUMEX> a year on average , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> growth rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'70s</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last season</TIMEX> , lift-ticket sales fell for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> .
     By some estimates , nearly a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> ski areas have been forced to shut down since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early '80s</TIMEX> .
     Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">resorts</ENAMEX> .
     But another big problem has been the aging of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> .
     Skiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport .
     In its new ad campaign , created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> , the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-second</TIMEX> TV spot features a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> -- even a blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skier</ENAMEX> .
     `` Ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> is great , '' cries out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot</ENAMEX> , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope .
     `` You 'll never know 'til you try , '' says a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skier</ENAMEX> .
     `` We used to show some hot-dog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skier</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">his twenties</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">thirties</TIMEX> going over the edge of a cliff , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathe Dillmann</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Ski Industries Association</ENAMEX> , the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> sponsoring the campaign .
     Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety .
     But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> smiling as she tries to get up from a fall .
     `` We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall , '' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillmann</ENAMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think if you slip , you 'll wind up in a body cast . ''
     The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">resorts</ENAMEX> and ski equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> ; normally , they only run ads hyping their own products and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     But in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Angel Fire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Red River</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Taos</ENAMEX> ski areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> , have even started shuttle-busing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lifts</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">resorts</ENAMEX> also are focusing more on the service side of their business .
     Since <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> are building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">nurseries</ENAMEX> , expanding ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> and adding entertainment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vail</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo.</ENAMEX> , now has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">playland</ENAMEX> that looks like an old mining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can ski through and pan for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">fool 's gold</ENAMEX> .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15</NUMEX> , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> usually had to hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sitter</ENAMEX> or take turns skiing while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> stayed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who had to go through that never came back , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Shannon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Vail Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> , which owns and operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vail</ENAMEX> and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Beaver Creek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">resorts</ENAMEX> .
     To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     In one phone call , ski <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons .
     And resorts are adding other amenities , such as pricey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> , health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">spas</ENAMEX> and vacation packages with a twist .
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Winter Carnival week</TIMEX> , for example , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Sunday River</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> can take a hot-air balloon ride .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">these days</TIMEX> want something else to do besides ski and sit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bar</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Borgeson</ENAMEX> , executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:ATTRACTION">Angel Fire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.M.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> .
     The ski industry hopes to increase the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 21.7 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next five years</TIMEX> with its latest ads and promotions .
     But some think that 's being overly optimistic .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , it may be tough to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> because skiing is still expensive : a lift ticket can cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $ 35</NUMEX> a day and equipment prices are rising .
     And most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> still prefer a warm climate for their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> excursions .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> survey of its travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 34 %</NUMEX> believe their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> will pick a trip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this winter</TIMEX> based on the availability of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">winter</TIMEX> sports , as opposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 %</NUMEX> who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor .
     `` Even if they could bring in that many new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> , I do n't know if -LCB- the industry -RCB- could handle that kind of an increase , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.

     `` Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will come on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> , the slopes will be overcrowded and then these -LCB- new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> -RCB- wo n't come back .

     They did n't play the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> game of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> as scheduled , and they did n't play it on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> either .
     But you knew that , did n't you ?
     They are supposed to play the game <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> here .
     The theory is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> , damaged by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will be able to get there .
     Like just about everything else , that remains to be seen .
     Aftershocks could intervene .
     But , at least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side .
     It may seem trivial to worry about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> amid the destruction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> wrought by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's quake , but the name of this column is `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">On Sports</ENAMEX> , '' so I feel obliged to do so .
     You might be interested to know that <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> , not survival , appeared to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thought of most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000-odd</NUMEX> that had gathered at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:04 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half-hour</TIMEX> before game time , when the quake struck .
     As soon as the tremor passed , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> , seated several rows in front of the open , upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed , faced the assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newsies</ENAMEX> and laughingly shouted , `` We arranged that just for you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> ! ''
     I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . ''
     I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">15 or so summers ago</TIMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Traverse City</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them .
     Perhaps primed by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> diet of radio and TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> thrusting microphones into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> calamity or another , fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who spied my press credential were eager to chat .
     `` It felt like I was on a station <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">platform</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">train</ENAMEX> went by , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , describing my own reaction .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> said she saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">park</ENAMEX> 's light standards sway .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> said he saw the upper rim undulate .
     I saw neither .
     Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played .
     `` I was near the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> , and saw a steel girder bow <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">six feet</NUMEX> from where I sat , but I stayed put for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 15 minutes</TIMEX> , '' confessed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> .
     `` I guess I thought , ` This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> and I 'm not gon na wimp out ! ' ''
     Here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Global Village</ENAMEX> , though , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> do not stay uninformed for long .
     Electrical power was out in still-daylighted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful .
     Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear .
     Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> , then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> , then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> .
     A section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> had collapsed , as had a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Interstate Highway 880</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Oakland</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> had died .
     At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:40 p.m.</TIMEX> , scheduled game time having passed , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> chanted `` Let 's Play Ball . ''
     No longer innocent , they qualified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadium</ENAMEX> was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> .
     Outside , I spotted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> lugging blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">concrete</ENAMEX> .
     `` Pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Candlestick</ENAMEX> , '' they said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> remained good natured , even bemused .
     TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> in the parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lots</ENAMEX> while , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">a few feet</NUMEX> away , others watched the interviews on their portable TVs .
     The only frenzy I saw was commercial : <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">Booths</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> who saw future profit in the items .
     The traffic jam out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">park</ENAMEX> was monumental .
     It took me a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> to move <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">10 feet</NUMEX> from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional hour</TIMEX> to reach an inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadway</ENAMEX> a half-block away .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">six-mile</NUMEX> trip to my airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> that had taken <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than three hours</TIMEX> .
     At my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Westin </ENAMEX>, power was out , some interior <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plaster</ENAMEX> had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else .
     With Garpian randomness , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotel</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Amfac</ENAMEX> , had been hit harder : A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOTEL">Westin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">ballroom</ENAMEX> , prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
     I fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Cubs</ENAMEX> jacket .
     I expected him to say , `` I told you so , '' but he already was snoring .
     The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">World Series</ENAMEX> seem unimportant .
     My response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
     Should the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> be played at all ?
     Sure .
     The quake and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> were n't related , unlike the massacre of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> that attended the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Olympics</ENAMEX> .
     That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> ironies intrude .
     This has been widely dubbed the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">BART Series</ENAMEX> , after the local subway line , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Bay Bridge Series</ENAMEX> .
     Flags fly at half-staff for the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bart Giamatti</ENAMEX> , the late baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> , and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> lies in ruins .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Series</ENAMEX> that was shaping up as the dullest since the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX>-over-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> go of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> has become memorable in the least fortunate way .
     Still , its edge is lost .
     It now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">`` off '' days</TIMEX> .
     And I will never again complain about a rainout .

     The disarray in the junk-bond market that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> with a credit crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> has offered commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion-dollar</NUMEX> takeovers .
     But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> seem to have kicked those chances away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> to deliver <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.2 billion</NUMEX> in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp .</ENAMEX>
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">more than a decade</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have been pressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> for expanded powers to act like securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds .
     Those expanded powers reached their zenith in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank loans for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.65 billion</NUMEX> leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA Inc .</ENAMEX>
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major selling points used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds .
     That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> for approval of the contested takeover .
     All <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.35 billion</NUMEX> in debt for the deal was supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Nathan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-head</ENAMEX> of mergers and acquisitions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> , says it is natural for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> collapse , he says , `` may tell you it 's not going to work that easily . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Batchelder</ENAMEX> , a mergers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">La Jolla</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , who aided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> on the bids which put both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA</ENAMEX> in play as takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have been `` preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batchelder</ENAMEX> says that in the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> would normally have loaned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> of a total buy-out price , with the loans secured by the target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's assets .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Another 20 %</NUMEX> of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> of junk bonds , which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> 's purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batchelder</ENAMEX> notes , `` was probably the most aggressive to date , '' with bank debt at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</NUMEX> of the purchase price .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batchelder</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's `` failure to deliver '' on its promise to raise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> bank debt for a labor-management buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> `` is very distressing to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of a ` highly-confident ' letter from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> . ''
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> , used just such a letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> in pursuing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> later agreed to work with a competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase Manhattan</ENAMEX> declined to comment on either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> situation , or on the changing nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' role in financing takeovers .
     In the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> 's problems , prices of junk bonds tumbled , throwing into doubt the ability of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">acquirers</ENAMEX> to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Solow</ENAMEX> , senior managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> , says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in structuring takeovers .
     But he warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> will have `` to have enough discipline '' not to make loans that are too risky .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> said in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million</NUMEX> .
     `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor , '' says a bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James B. Lee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of syndications and private placements at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> , said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance .
     As evidence , he cites <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's arrangement for the final financing of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Medical International Inc.</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> served as both the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and an equity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> .
     Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> have another advantage over investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in financing contested takeovers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Fleischer Jr.</ENAMEX> , a takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson</ENAMEX> , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidder</ENAMEX> who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> in its initial offer to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.7 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 175</NUMEX> a share .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> says that decision was based on the financial , not political , drawbacks of junk bonds .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Davis</ENAMEX> wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> in his controversial bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> .
     In the end , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> used junk bonds so that he could raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> 's bid to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200</NUMEX> a share .
     Some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterbacks</ENAMEX> said the initial lower bid , without junk bonds , was a factor in his losing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Time</ENAMEX> eluded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> by acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warner Communications Inc .</ENAMEX>
     The success of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA</ENAMEX> financing , and the failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">NWA</ENAMEX> bank debt , according to a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner </ENAMEX>.
     But it was broad-scale rejection by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chase</ENAMEX> are attempting to put together a new , lower bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takanori Mizuno</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Institute for Financial Affairs Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center</ENAMEX> on finance and economics , says , `` The junk bond market became very jittery , and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harley-Davidson Inc.</ENAMEX> filed suit in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> here , alleging that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> that holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2 %</NUMEX> of its stock made `` false , deceptive and misleading '' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX> 's complaint claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm I. Glazer</ENAMEX> , violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's shares outstanding and that when the required <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart-Scott-Rodino</ENAMEX> filing eventually was made , it did n't disclose the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> could n't immediately be reached to comment .
     But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harley</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> publicly questioned the legality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's filing procedures , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Rochester</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> said `` we complied with every law , '' and he denied any wrongdoing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> said in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early October</TIMEX> that it may seek a controlling interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harley-Davidson </ENAMEX>, or seek representation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harley</ENAMEX> has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> or any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">party</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland Steel Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">steelmaker</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">43 cents</NUMEX> a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 61 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.70</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing .
     Sales fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 981.2 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> .
     The earnings also mark a significant drop from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 45.3 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> a share .
     Moreover , the earnings were well below <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' expectations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.16</NUMEX> a share .
     In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35.875</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector .
     However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Third-quarter</TIMEX> shipments slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-ago</TIMEX> period , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year 's second quarter</TIMEX> .
     Profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> shipped for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segment</ENAMEX> slid to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 26</NUMEX> a ton , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 66</NUMEX> a ton <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 57</NUMEX> a ton <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a quarter earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bradford</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> , said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar , hot-rolled and structural steel .
     Structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> , which primarily serves the construction market , was especially hurt by a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> price drop , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford</ENAMEX> said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs .
     The increased labor costs became effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Aug. 1</TIMEX> under terms of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-year</TIMEX> labor agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Steelworkers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's service center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">segment</ENAMEX> , which saw operating profit drop to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , experienced much of the same demand and cost problems , as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> and an upgraded computer information system .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W. Luerssen</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's short-term outlook is `` clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets . ''
     However , he noted that steel mill bookings are up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early summer</TIMEX> levels , and that he expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to improve its cost performance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> , profit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 113 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.04</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.19 billion</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 204.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.76</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.03 billion</NUMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     The `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">earth</ENAMEX> .
     When things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
     However , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake-resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully `` aftershock-resistant . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
     That structural lack is crucial because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are the only source of market liquidity .
     And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> -LRB- on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> -RRB- and `` upstairs '' market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> -LRB- in the over-the-counter market -RRB- are the only market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
     When they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone .
     And when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -LRB- the way prices are determined -RRB- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Friday the 13th</TIMEX> -LRB- as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago this week</TIMEX> -RRB- the markets became unlinked .
     When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
     Lack of important , needed information can cause fear .
     Fear is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of panic .
     Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
     And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
     When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at various prices -RRB- be made available to all , not just to market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> .
     Because of a lack of information and access , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information .
     To add aftershock-damping power to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -LRB- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -RRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -- particularly institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and other market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
     What market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
     Liquidity is not a service .
     It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> buy what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , and at a profit .
     As a result , while any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> may purchase immediacy by selling to a market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> -LRB- which is micro-liquidity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">seller</ENAMEX> has changed .
     In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> -LRB- a result of some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">post-1987</TIMEX> crash studies -RRB- also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
     In an open electronic system , any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">broker-dealer</ENAMEX> would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at each price -RRB- entered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dealers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> alike , and to enter and execute orders .
     Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> -- not just those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediaries</ENAMEX> who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> alike would compete on the level playing field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> sought and called a `` national market system '' -LRB- not yet achieved -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">almost 15 years ago</TIMEX> when it passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Securities Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX> 's market gyrations did not result in severe `` aftershocks . ''
     Were we smart or just lucky ?
     I 'm not certain .
     But I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> add their mighty shock-damping power to our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's markets .

     NOW YOU SEE IT , now you do n't .
     The recession , that is .
     The economy 's stutter steps leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
     So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past seven years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy .
     Some may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession .
     Different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher .
     For those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who believe -- or fear -- that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a recession year</TIMEX> , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio .
     In a nutshell , pros advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in `` defensive '' industries .
     A heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds .
     It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
     But that may not be possible , because recessions often take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> by surprise .
     `` They always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
     When they do hit , they hit fast , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David A. Wyss</ENAMEX> , chief financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Data Resources</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McGraw-Hill Inc .</ENAMEX>
     Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyss</ENAMEX> advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do that `` the best thing to be in is long that is , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20-year</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds . ''
     The reason is simple , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyss</ENAMEX> says : `` Interest rates almost always decline during recession . ''
     As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
     They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
     That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
     But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much , because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon .
     Long-term bonds , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">many years</TIMEX> left before maturity , swing more widely in price .
     But not just any bonds will do .
     Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyss</ENAMEX> says .
     As times get tougher , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fret about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will have enough money to pay their debts .
     This hurts the price of corporate bonds .
     Also , he notes , `` most corporate bonds are callable . ''
     That means that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> the face value -LRB- plus , in some cases , a sweetener -RRB- .
     When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> to do just that ; they then save on interest costs .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny .
     If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
     It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avner Arbel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Cornell University</ENAMEX> .
     `` Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could be a disaster . ''
     Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     During an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipals .
     And , like corporates , many municipal bonds are callable .
     But a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> , going against the consensus , do n't think bonds would help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> even if a recession is in the offing .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey L. Beach</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of research for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Underwood Neuhaus & Co.</ENAMEX> , a brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> , who thinks that `` we 're either in a recession or about to go into one . ''
     What 's more , he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual : `` Once the downturn comes , it 's going to be very hard to reverse . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> , he advises , `` should be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
     Because he sees a `` <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 % to 6 %</NUMEX> base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon .
     Instead , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beach</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Confair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sigma Financial Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Allentown</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Pa.</ENAMEX> , also recommends that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> go heavily for cash .
     He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad .
     `` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confair</ENAMEX> says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> 's plan for a `` soft landing , '' he says , requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor . ''
     A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confair</ENAMEX> adds .
     It has to be engineered over and over again , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">month</TIMEX> .
     He believes that the task facing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">ax</ENAMEX> and a buzz saw . ''
     And , in a sense , that 's the kind of task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> ' portfolios .
     It comes down to a question of whether to try to `` time '' the market .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
     Most studies show that buy-and-hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> historically have earned an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> return from stocks of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 % to 10 %</NUMEX> , including both dividends and price appreciation .
     That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
     Moreover , because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> should n't even worry too much about timing .
     `` Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Katz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief investment officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Value Matrix Management Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> notes that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have been predicting a recession for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least two years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70 %</NUMEX> of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
     Frequent trading runs up high commission costs .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">in-and-outer</ENAMEX> might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
     Still , few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
     After all , in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> recessions since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1960</TIMEX> , stocks declined .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Davis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ned Davis Research Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Nokomis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21 %</NUMEX> , and the decrease began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an average of six months</TIMEX> before a recession officially started .
     By the time a recession is `` official '' -LRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two consecutive quarters</TIMEX> of declining gross national product -RRB- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done - and , in the typical case , the recession is already <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> over .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">About six months</TIMEX> before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> anticipate a recovery .
     The average recession lasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about a year</TIMEX> .
     Unfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in timing stock sales or purchases .
     But whatever their advice about timing , none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
     For the portion of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's portfolio that stays in stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> have a number of suggestions .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is , low prices in relation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's earnings per share .
     `` Low P-E '' stocks , he says , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . ''
     In good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arbel</ENAMEX> urges <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to discard stocks in small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession , he says .
     And in any case , he argues , stocks of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are `` almost as overpriced as they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30 , 1987</TIMEX> , just before the crash . ''
     For example , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arbel</ENAMEX> says , stocks of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are selling for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 19</NUMEX> times cash flow .
     -LRB- Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> common gauge of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's financial health . -RRB-
     That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.7</NUMEX> that prevailed before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> stock-market crash , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arbel</ENAMEX> says .
     And it 's way above the ratio -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> times cash flow -RRB- that bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are selling for .
     Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">Food</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">tobacco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utilities</ENAMEX> are the classic examples .
     Recession or not , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Putnam III</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turnaround Letter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , offers one final tip for recession-wary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` Keep some money available for opportunities , '' he says .
     `` If the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorfman</ENAMEX> covers investing issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureau</ENAMEX> .
     Some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> consistently weather the storm better than others .
     The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first six months</TIMEX> of the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> recessions .

     Bond prices posted strong gains as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> went on a bargain hunt .
     But while the overall market improved , the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk-bond prices rose .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> said it postponed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 220 million</NUMEX> senior subordinated debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">York International Corp .</ENAMEX>
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 475 million</NUMEX> debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX> that was still being negotiated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late last night</TIMEX> .
     The issue by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said the restructuring of the railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's issue shows how tough it is for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> to sell even the junk bonds of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> had to slash the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> ' junk-bond offering to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> has delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand Union Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.16 billion</NUMEX> junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grand Union</ENAMEX> offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> to acquire common stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">York</ENAMEX> issue was delayed because of market conditions .
     `` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> -RCB- is no exception , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariel Clemensen</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , high-yield research , at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> .
     Portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Baldwin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing director</ENAMEX> of high-yield investments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chancellor Capital Management</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
     If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> likes the offering .
     But several mutual-fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> .
     While they consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> issue to be good , they do n't view it as the best .
     To lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> bonds , portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> equity kicker .
     The bonds are expected to have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 1\/2 %</NUMEX> coupon rate .
     The equity arrangement apparently would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bondholders</ENAMEX> to buy a total of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNW Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> 's parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the restructuring .
     According to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> familiar with the negotiations , the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of equity would come directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> and a fund affiliated with the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> , which would reduce their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CNW</ENAMEX> equity holdings by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> each .
     That would leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX> fund with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> stake and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> .
     Despite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market .
     Junk bonds ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-half</NUMEX> point higher with so-called high-quality issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market , the benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven-eighths</NUMEX> point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.75</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount .
     The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
     That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported that consumer prices rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 0.2 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , slightly lower than some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> had expected .
     But there were also rumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
     Short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities ended narrowly mixed , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two-year</TIMEX> notes posting slight declines while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-year</TIMEX> notes were slightly higher .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> executed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-day</TIMEX> matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
     The move was interpreted by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> as a sign that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> at which it has been hovering around during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past week</TIMEX> .
     The closely watched funds rate is what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other on overnight loans .
     It is considered an early signal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> credit policy changes .
     `` The fact that they did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-day</TIMEX> matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
     They are telling us that -LCB- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> -RCB- is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chandross</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond was quoted late at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 25\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.955 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 29\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.032 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> notes were quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 9\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.937 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 26\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.007 %</NUMEX> .
     Short-term rates rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The discount rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.56 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.51 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , while the rate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six-month</TIMEX> bills rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.57 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.53 %</NUMEX> .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.75 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> bills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The average yield on the bills was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.35 %</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.61 %</NUMEX> at the previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">52-week</TIMEX> bill auction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 21</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's yield was the lowest since <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.22 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 27</TIMEX> .
     Here are details of the auction :
     Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
     Thus , higher bidding narrows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's return while lower bidding widens it .
     The percentage rates are calculated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 360-day year</TIMEX> , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 365-day year</TIMEX> .
     Corporate Issues
     Junk bond price climbed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX> said junk bond issues on average were up by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4 to 1\/2</NUMEX> point with so-called quality issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> posting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-point gains .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Petrolane Gas Service</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 1\/4 %</NUMEX> debentures traded at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> , after trading around par <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">RJR </ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 1\/2 %</NUMEX> subordinated debentures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2001</TIMEX> were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 5\/8</NUMEX> after trading at below par <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> .
     Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
     Municipals
     Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 140 million</NUMEX> of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokers</ENAMEX> .
     There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's portfolios .
     According to market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> and under maturity range unchanged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> percentage point higher in yield .
     Away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest .
     Long dollar bonds were flat to up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> point .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">New Jersey Turnpike Authority</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.20 %</NUMEX> issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2018</TIMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 3\/8</NUMEX> bid to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.32 %</NUMEX> , down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> percentage point .
     The debt of some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuers</ENAMEX> pulled off lows reached after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's massive earthquake , although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> remained cautious .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.06 billion</NUMEX> in general fund reserves to meet <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion</NUMEX> in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> .
     It 's also unclear precisely how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> will rebuild its reserve , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Katz</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
     Meanwhile , new issuance was slow .
     The largest sale in the competitive arena was a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55.7 million</NUMEX> issue of school financing bonds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Virginia Public School Authority</ENAMEX> .
     A balance of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.8 million</NUMEX> remained in late order-taking , according to the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">manager</ENAMEX> .
     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     Mortgage securities generally ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6\/32 to 9\/32</NUMEX> point higher , but lagged gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market because of a shift in the shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Premium Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> securities with coupon rates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> securities were down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/4</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109 30\/32</NUMEX> .
     If the refinancing plan clears <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> paying much above par for them .
     In the current-coupon sector , a shift in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities ended at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 6\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9\/32</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 10\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6\/32</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue was yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.42 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-year</TIMEX> note widened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> percentage point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.48</NUMEX> .
     While Remic issuance may slow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming days</TIMEX> because of the shift in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> yield curve , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">underwriters</ENAMEX> continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> new Remics totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 900 million</NUMEX> were announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Foreign Bonds
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government bonds ended little changed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> awaited an economic policy address <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3\/4 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">2003\/2007</TIMEX> was down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2\/32</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 29\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.09 %</NUMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3\/4 %</NUMEX> notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> were unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 19\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.94 %</NUMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , the bellwether No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> bond of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> ended off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.72</NUMEX> , to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.32 %</NUMEX> , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> benchmark issue due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> ended <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05 point</NUMEX> lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.85</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.02 %</NUMEX> .
