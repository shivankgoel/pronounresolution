     Battle-tested <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> here always buck up nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> with the tale of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boatload</ENAMEX> of samurai <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> blown ashore <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">375 years ago</TIMEX> .
     `` From the beginning , it took a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with extraordinary qualities to succeed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimihide Takimura</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> group 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kensetsu Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX> unit .
     Here in this new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> just across the border from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> , turnover is dizzying , infrastructure shoddy , bureaucracy intense .
     Even after-hours drag ; `` karaoke '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bars</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revelers</ENAMEX> sing over recorded music , are prohibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's powerful musicians <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     Still , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sanyo Industries Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Matsushita Electronics Components Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> have set up shop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Northern Baja</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     Keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Ruffo</ENAMEX> when he takes office <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 1</TIMEX> , as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's modern history .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , with its desperate need for investment , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match .
     But the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean .
     Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are put off by what they consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits .
     From the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> ' viewpoint , vaunted tactics of methodical <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> do n't count for much in a land where a saying says `` there are no fixed rules . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> ranks as only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> largest foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">investor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> of the total investments .
     That is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 1 %</NUMEX> of all the money <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> has invested abroad .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> would like to change that .
     The young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> so admires <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> discipline that he sends his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mexico City</ENAMEX> .
     He already has finagled a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> loan from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> urgently needs more help .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> 's unpopular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">Institutional Revolutionary Party</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PRI</ENAMEX> , faces congressional elections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">PRI</ENAMEX> to stand a chance , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth .
     But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> needs big investment inflows -- quickly .
     The problem is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> make decisions with a view well beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the coming months</TIMEX> that weigh so heavily on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> will come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , but not immediately , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazushige Suzuki</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director-general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Japanese External Trade Organization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
     If not now , when ?
     `` When the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">fruit</ENAMEX> is ripe , it falls from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> by itself , '' he says .
     Pressed on the matter , he is more specific .
     `` There will be big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> investments probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five to 10 years from now</TIMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryukichi Imai</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> , agrees that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> may be too eager .
     `` There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> that there is a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> money waiting behind the gate , and that by slightly opening the gate , that money will enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> .
     I do n't think that is the case . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity .
     `` Because of distance , it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability we 've achieved , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymaker</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> is sending a number of missions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> or tourism .
     It is hoped that other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> would then follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's economic outlook , but also reservations about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> 's recently revamped investment law .
     Unable to get a new law through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">congress</ENAMEX> with a strong leftist bloc , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Mexico</ENAMEX> jury-rigged the existing law 's regulations .
     It created special <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20-year</TIMEX> trusts to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> ownership in some once-closed industries .
     It also made artful use of semantics , redefining as non-strategic industries some that had been in the national domain .
     `` Those devices do n't give sufficient certainty to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasuo Nakamura</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Industrial Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nakamura</ENAMEX> cites the case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> who wants to build a giant tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">complex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baja</ENAMEX> and has been trying for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight years</TIMEX> to get around <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property .
     He could develop the beach through a trust , but instead is trying have his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> become a naturalized <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> so his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> gains direct control .
     Some say the best hope for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> is catching the eye of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> by promoting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> industry the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> clearly like -- the border assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , known as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">maquiladoras</ENAMEX> , '' which are open to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> foreign control .
     `` We must do more to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baja</ENAMEX> if we want them to invest elsewhere , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruffo</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor-elect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">National Action Party</ENAMEX> and himself a succesful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> .
     Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> are heartened by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruffo</ENAMEX> 's pledge to cut corruption associated with the ruling party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruffo</ENAMEX> frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , where some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> oppose what they consider <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> efforts to use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">maquiladoras</ENAMEX> to crack the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market through the back door .

     Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic growth , currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar 's near-term performance .
     Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> polled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones International News Service</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar to ease only mildly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> .
     Opinion is mixed over its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three-month</TIMEX> prospects .
     Half of those polled see the currency trending lower over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next three months</TIMEX> , while the others forecast a modest rebound after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the New Year</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , the dollar stood at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8415 West German marks</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8340 marks</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> , and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.85 yen</NUMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A month ago</TIMEX> , a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8690 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">139.75 yen</NUMEX> by the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> .
     Sterling was trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5805</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5820</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency was trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 142.95 yen</NUMEX> at midmorning , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.80 yen</NUMEX> at the opening and up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.15 yen</NUMEX> .
     The average of estimates of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> polled puts the dollar around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8200 marks</NUMEX> at the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.33 yen</NUMEX> .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late January</TIMEX> , the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8200 marks</NUMEX> and near <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142 yen</NUMEX> .
     Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.9000 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">145 yen</NUMEX> , while the dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> see the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency trading around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.7600 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">138 yen</NUMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> eases interest rates .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Owen</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kleinwort Benson & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , said he expects further cuts in short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert White</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of corporate trade at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Interstate of California</ENAMEX> , agreed with that view and predicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> federal funds rate will drop to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 7 3\/4 % and 8 %</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">60 days</TIMEX> from its current level at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 13\/16 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> funds is the rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other on overnight loans ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> also predicted a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-point cut in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> discount rate in the near future .
     The discount rate , currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> , is the rate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> charges member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> for loans , using government securities as collateral .
     He expects such a cut `` because of problems in several sectors of the economy , particularly real estate and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">automobiles</ENAMEX> . ''
     Bolstering his argument , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> sales for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> 's revised <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX> fall .
     The drop marked the largest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">monthly</TIMEX> tumble since a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> slide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1982</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> 's survey , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> of currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     Indeed , in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point .
     Several other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , notably in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> 's lead by raising their own key rates .
     And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a week later</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> raised its official discount rate by a half point to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.75 %</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> discount rate is the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's base rate on loans to commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> .
     After a surprisingly sharp widening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> merchandise trade deficit -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.77 billion</NUMEX> from a revised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.24 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and well above expectations -- and a startling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point drop in stock prices on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 9 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 3\/4 %</NUMEX> .
     But predictions that central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Group of Seven</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">G-7</ENAMEX> -RRB- major industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> would continue their massive dollar sales went astray , as the market drove the dollar downward on its own , reacting to Wall Street 's plunge and subsequent price volatility , lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest rates and signs of a slowing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">G-7</ENAMEX> consists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Italy</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomoshige Kakita</ENAMEX> , senior deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> in the treasury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsui Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> , suggested that uncertainty about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks and bonds has made <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand .
     But , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kakita</ENAMEX> added , once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> equities regain some stability , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds , whose value rises when interest rates decline .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kakita</ENAMEX> said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">135 yen</NUMEX> .
     `` If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">135 yen</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jens-Uwe Fischer</ENAMEX> , a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , said he expects the dollar to recover within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next three months</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1.88 marks</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic data , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade figures , level off .
     He contended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> wo n't ease rates further , but predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> will relax key rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Zapfel</ENAMEX> , chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Boston</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , took an opposite stance .
     He said he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1.80 marks</NUMEX> by the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> after a short-lived dash to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.87 marks</NUMEX> by the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> interest rates , he said , will remain unchanged .
     `` But I 'm not one of these great dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> you see more of these days , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zapfel</ENAMEX> said .
     `` I ca n't really see it dropping far below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.80 marks</NUMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Greene</ENAMEX> , chief foreign exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Julius Baer & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , fits the description of a `` great dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bear</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1 , 1991</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Economics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Haussmann</ENAMEX> said .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will also repeal the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> transaction tax on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-time purchase of stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     The announcement follows several comments by government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will speed up the repeal of the tax , which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">European Community</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1992</TIMEX> .
     The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> into rival financial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">centers</ENAMEX> , especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , where trading transactions is n't taxed .
     The tax has raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than one billion marks</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 545.3 million</NUMEX> -RRB- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns .
     In the interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann</ENAMEX> did n't specify the amount of revenue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> will lose after the tax disappears .
     The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">end of 1990</TIMEX> and guarantees its abolition even if the current center-right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">coalition</ENAMEX> loses the elections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December 1990</TIMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made a final `` take-it-or-leave it '' offer on the minimum wage : an increase to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.25</NUMEX> an hour over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> , and only if accompanied by a lower wage for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first six months of a job</TIMEX> .
     Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> has decided to accept the higher wage over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">only two years</TIMEX> .
     The sub-minimum wage would apply only to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-time teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 days</TIMEX> .

     The head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> 's interest-rate options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> has left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , following valuation errors that resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33 million</NUMEX> charge against its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Edelson</ENAMEX> resigned recently , but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> close to the situation said the resignation was forced .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelson</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment .
     A separate inquiry by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> cleared Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelson</ENAMEX> of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> .
     That inquiry has n't resolved similar allegations involving another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> options <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .
     In other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> :
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kennedy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> in swaps contracts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , to assume Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelson</ENAMEX> 's duties and to be trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for derivative products , including swaps and interest-rate options .
     -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Wakeman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to straighten out the mess , resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakeman</ENAMEX> , whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> tried to keep , did n't return calls for comment .
     Separately , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> for losses on forward-rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX> charge was `` not material '' and that no personnel changes were made as a result .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> situation was `` totally different '' from problems in the interest-rate options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the situation , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> loss stemmed from a computer program for calculating prices on forward-rate agreements that failed to envision an interest-rate environment where short-term rates were equal to or higher than long-term rates .
     While the incidents involving interest-rate options and forward-rate agreements are unrelated , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> say they echo a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> incident in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 80 million</NUMEX> .
     These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions .
     In an interest-rate options contract , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> pays a fee to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period .
     In a forward-rate agreement , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem .
     Started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> 's interest-rate options <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> was a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">force</ENAMEX> in the field .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">From 1987 to 1988</TIMEX> , the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> 's option contracts outstanding mushroomed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17 billion</NUMEX> .
     More importantly , the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2-to-1 .
     With such a lopsided book of options , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> has examined its methodologies and internal controls .
     `` We consider our internal controls to have worked well , '' she said , adding that some procedures have been strengthened .
     Its valuation methodologies , she said , `` are recognized as some of the best on the Street .
     Not a lot was needed to be done .

     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas W. Wathen</ENAMEX> went big league <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's Inc .</ENAMEX>
     There was a wanted poster offering `` Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James '' and the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> logo with an open eye and the inscription `` We Never Sleep , '' which inspired the phrase `` private eye . ''
     Then there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gold watches once owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Pinkerton</ENAMEX> , who founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1850</TIMEX> .
     But there were supposed to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> claims .
     The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> encountered in building his closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection Security Service</ENAMEX> into the largest detective and security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> through acquisitions .
     The ever-optimistic Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> can be a shortcut to growth , it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems .
     `` We cleared out a lot of rats ' nests , '' says the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">60-year-old</TIMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> , who started his career as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and worked as a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> for several large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , built his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection</ENAMEX> from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX> .
     He joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1963</TIMEX> and bought it from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next year</TIMEX> .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next 20 years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection</ENAMEX> opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     Yet although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection</ENAMEX> was netting bigger and bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> provided security for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> Summer Olympics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> -- it still did n't have the name recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> .
     So when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands Inc.</ENAMEX> decided to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> saw a chance to accomplish several objectives .
     He decided he could easily merge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> with his own while slashing overhead costs because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> already operated in many of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     He could acquire a staff of loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , many of whom had spent their entire careers with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , he could eliminate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> and he could get the name recognition he 'd wanted .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> also relished the chance to demonstrate an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> like himself , who 'd spent his whole career in the security business , could run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> better than an unfocused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">conglomerate</ENAMEX> or investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> .
     `` The security business is my favorite subject .
     I love this business , '' he says .
     `` Most of the LBO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> do n't know how to run a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> anyway . ''
     But there were hitches , not the least of which was that , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> says , he proceeded almost blindly in doing the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95 million</NUMEX> acquisition , which was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January 1988</TIMEX> .
     `` We were n't allowed to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons .
     If we had , it might have scared us off , '' he says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Five years</TIMEX> of rapid expansion under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> , with an emphasis on marketing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's services instead of improving them , had hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> profits , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> claims .
     He says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> could n't tell whether accounts receivable had been paid or not .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business , with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired , he adds .
     And regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> were `` egregiously overstaffed , '' he claims .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing the work of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> , `` and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had company automobiles . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> declined to comment on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> 's accusations .
     The acquisition combined the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 410 million</NUMEX> , and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> largest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection</ENAMEX> , with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</NUMEX> in sales , creating the industry 's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , which took on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> name .
     Even after divesting itself of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 million</NUMEX> of unprofitable business , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> will have sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 610 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> and operating profit roughly double the industry average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%-3 %</NUMEX> of sales , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Greif</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sutro & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , which arranged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> acquisition .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> says his turnaround strategy has been simple : just hack away at the fat .
     He began by closing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> , eliminating <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 31 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX>-person adminstrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> .
     He shut down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's tony <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> is a nondescript , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">street</ENAMEX> from the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:AIRPORT">Van Nuys Airport</ENAMEX> .
     Next , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> rates , which were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75-cents</NUMEX>-an-hour lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection</ENAMEX> 's average rate of around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.63</NUMEX> .
     And he got rid of low-margin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> that just were n't making money for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> , who says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> had a loss of nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> , boasts that he 's made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> profitable again .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">team</ENAMEX> still must pay down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 82 million</NUMEX> of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next four years</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , earnings of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> did n't cover debt service and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> was forced to borrow <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20 million</NUMEX> of subordinated debt .
     `` We would n't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems had n't been there , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> says .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This year</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit .
     Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> recently filed suit in state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> , seeking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 40 million</NUMEX> in damages from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Old Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The suit alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> misrepresented the financial condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> before the sale , failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> was in default , had n't registered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> name and trademark in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> and did n't tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">California Plant Protection</ENAMEX> about some labor controversies .
     `` We have previously had discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's Inc.</ENAMEX> concerning the -LCB- sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> -RCB- and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> .
     `` As this is now a litigation matter , we have no further comment . ''
     And then there 's the case of the missing gold watch .
     The lawsuit alleges that an inventory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> memorabilia disclosed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the watches had n't been forked over by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brand</ENAMEX> 's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> in an amount as yet -LCB- to be -RCB- determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained , '' the suit charges .
     The key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> future will be sticking to what it does best -- being a security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is also renewing its emphasis on investigations , particularly undercover investigations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> .
     Although investigations now account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinkerton 's</ENAMEX> total revenue , that side of the business has traditionally been the more `` glamorous '' of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and it carries historical and sentimental value .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> `` just had a different approach , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wathen</ENAMEX> says .

     You 'd think all the stories about well-heeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> grants would prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies .
     No way .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> .
     It appears that the only thing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is learning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests .
     Right now , the largest loan the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> can insure in high-cost housing markets is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 101,250</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">lobbies</ENAMEX> persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to raise the ceiling to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 124,875</NUMEX> , making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> loans more accessible to the well-to-do .
     But it does that at the cost of deepening the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> 's exposure if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> is forced to pay for more loans going sour .
     This is no idle fear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.2 billion</NUMEX> in loan defaults .
     But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> have in mind for housing .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> will begin hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next week</TIMEX> on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Other Senators</ENAMEX> want to lower the down payments required on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX>-insured loans .
     That would be a formula for ensuring even more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> red ink .
     Experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing-loan default is the down payment .
     Because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchaser</ENAMEX> can use an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> loan to finance all points and closing costs , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> can wind up lending more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> is worth .
     If housing prices continue to fall , many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> would be better off walking away from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">homes</ENAMEX> and leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> with the losses .
     Much the same thing happened with busted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&Ls</ENAMEX> , a problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> just `` solved '' with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 166 billion</NUMEX> bailout .
     We hear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> is toying with going along with some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> proposals .
     That sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> tar pit .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> has written Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> urging him to reject <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations .
     But even if he agrees , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> does n't write the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's housing law -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> does .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> cynically view the current discrediting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects .
     Exhibit A is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX> vote to fund <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal .
     None of the grants had been requested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> , judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing .
     More and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> now realize that the key to ending future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals lies in forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to clean up its own act .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This week</TIMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Baltimore Sun</ENAMEX> editorial said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> should forget about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Pierce</ENAMEX> 's testimony for the moment and call some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> : the various congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> pork-barrel projects .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun</ENAMEX> concluded that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> is only part of the problem -- and a part that 's gone .
     `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> is to be reformed , '' it concluded , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> will `` have to start looking into , and doing something about , the practices of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> . ''
     Of course , self-reform is about the last thing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is interested in .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> programs say they merely want to help <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> who are frozen out of high-priced markets .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> program is hemorrhaging bad loans .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> has submitted a package of reforms , and they are surely headed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> sausage-grinder .
     Like the S&L mess before it , this is a problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> should be solving , not ignoring .

     After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's health-care system , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Seidman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business .
     Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> .
     Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> are free-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Puccini</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , warned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus .
     Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">National Association of Manufacturers</ENAMEX> are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who currently lack health insurance .
     Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program , and nobody expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system .
     But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine .
     `` I ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> , who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">department</ENAMEX> dealing with health matters .
     Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> is n't taking the initiative on health issues , business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are dealing with congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> who champion health-care revision .
     `` Business across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> is spending more time addressing this issue , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass .</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     `` It 's a bottom-line issue . ''
     Business complained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> introduced a bill that would require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> to provide a minimum level of health insurance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> but does n't contain cost-control measures .
     Partly in response , a bipartisan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> from the finance and labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">committees</ENAMEX> is drafting a plan to attract broader support .
     It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.1 %</NUMEX> of gross national product , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> health costs already are the highest in the world .
     By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's equal <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 %</NUMEX> of GNP , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's total output of goods and services .
     Management and labor worry that the gap makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> less competitive .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> estimates that health costs add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 700</NUMEX> to the price of each of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 300 to $ 500</NUMEX> more per car than foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> pay for health .
     `` The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength , '' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Maher</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> health-and-benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> .
     Labor is upset because many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are using higher employee insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pittston Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nynex Corp .</ENAMEX>
     In their new contract <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Communications Workers of America</ENAMEX> agreed to look for `` prompt and lasting national solutions '' to rising health-care costs .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are cynical about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Schramm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Health Insurance Association of America</ENAMEX> , scoffs at `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> who want to socialize the entire financing system '' for health .
     `` They hope they can buy some government cost discipline , '' but this is a false hope , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schramm</ENAMEX> says .
     He asserts that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business .
     So far neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> lacks a comprehensive health-care policy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Catastrophic Care Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage .
     A bipartisan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rockefeller</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">W.Va .</ENAMEX> -RRB- is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next March 1</TIMEX> .
     A quadrennial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> appointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general .
     It is expected to report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next summer</TIMEX> .
     `` No magic bullet will be discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an election year</TIMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortney Stark</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif .</ENAMEX> -RRB-
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> could be a window for action .
     The pressure for change will rise with costs .
     `` I think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employers</ENAMEX> are really going to be the ones to push for major change , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Canner</ENAMEX> , a health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NAM</ENAMEX> .
     Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> , particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">American Medical Association</ENAMEX> , and perhaps from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> as well , if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> takes steps that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> fear will limit the availability of care .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NAM</ENAMEX> embraces efforts , which both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> and the medical profession have begun , to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HHS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 25 %</NUMEX> of the medical procedures performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">each year</TIMEX> may be inappropriate or unnecessary .
     Limiting care wo n't be easy or popular .
     `` To slow the rise in total spending , it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">NAM</ENAMEX> warns in a policy statement .
     This will `` require us to define -- and redefine -- what is ` necessary ' or ` appropriate ' care .
     This involves trade-offs and -LCB- it -RCB- cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is ` necessary . ' ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> also embraces treatment guidelines .
     In addition , it 's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> as a whole and on individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> as a way to slow health-care spending .
     At a meeting here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> , the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">federation</ENAMEX> plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul .

     Takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed : namely , industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> can continue bidding for one another , but financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> such as leveraged buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing .
     `` The way the world is shaping up , the strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> is going to be the rule and the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyer</ENAMEX> is going to be the exception , '' said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> .

     At a time when most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> if the industry declines more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> expects .
     Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities .
     `` Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Young</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resource Information Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bedford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , economic-forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     `` Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt . ''
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> said the acquisition would more than double the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's debt of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $ 3 billion</NUMEX> .
     It also could be a drag on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> earnings because the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> in goodwill -- the amount by which the bid exceeds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> 's book value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.5 billion</NUMEX> -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> each produce market pulp , containerboard and white paper .
     That means goods could be manufactured closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> , saving shipping costs , he said .
     Moreover , production runs would be longer , cutting inefficiencies from adjusting machinery between production cycles .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> could save money in selling pulp , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> uses its own sales <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> employs higher-cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahn</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> has accounted in its strategy for a `` significant downturn '' in the pulp and paper industry , an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings .
     But he said that even under those conditions , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> still would realize a savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of millions of dollars</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> following a merger .
     `` The fit is so good , we see this as a time of opportunity , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> , which has suspended its stock-repurchase program , would finance the acquisition with all bank debt , provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BankAmerica Corp .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">349,900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> worth .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> , defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk-bond market , which limits how much value the target could reach in a debt-financed recapitalization .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laidig</ENAMEX> , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> met at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz</ENAMEX> , a law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> specializing in takeover defense .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> also is being advised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs & Co .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advisers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wasserstein , Perella & Co.</ENAMEX> , which stands to receive a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> fee if the takeover succeeds , and the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearman & Sterling</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> is n't likely to meet before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week after next</TIMEX> to respond to the bid .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 business days</TIMEX> to respond .
     In addition to the usual array of defenses , including a so-called poison pill and a staggered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> has another takeover defense : a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> state law barring hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> from merging acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> is incorporated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> has filed a lawsuit in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> challenging the poison pill and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> merger law .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> 's poison pill allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> to vote to rescind it , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">90 to 120 days</TIMEX> , and would n't affect the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> law .
     Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> mentioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> as possible counterbidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Pacific Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MacMillan Bloedel Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     `` I 'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn McAuley</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Manhattan Co .</ENAMEX>
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Paper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> declined to comment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> could n't be reached for comment , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MacMillan Bloedel</ENAMEX> said it has n't any plans to make a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> were quick to spot other potential takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">candidates</ENAMEX> , all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations .
     Among paper company stocks that rallied on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> because of the offer were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Union Camp</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37.75</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federal Paperboard</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.875</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mead</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.375</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.75</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Temple Inland Inc.</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62.25</NUMEX> .
     In over-the-counter national trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bowater Inc.</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.50</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> argued that there wo n't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry 's continuing capacity-expansion program is eating up available cash .
     Moreover , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said they expect a foreign paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> with deeper pockets than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> to end up acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> , signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive .
     `` This is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time event , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> bid .
     But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe that , given the attractiveness of paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' cash flows , as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next several months</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> , these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> added , could be either foreign or other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concerns</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation '' in the paper industry , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Devario</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` I do n't think anyone is now immune from takeover , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schneider</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Duff & Phelps Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> .
     He added : `` Every paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> has to be saying to itself , ` Before someone comes after me , I 'm going to go after somebody . ' ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prudential-Bache</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> said he does n't see the industry 's capacity-expansion program hindering takeover activity .
     Several projects , he said , are still on the drawing board .
     Moreover , `` it 's a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> than to build one . ''
     Indeed , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world .
     Some predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> will end up being owned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Devario</ENAMEX> said that , to stay competitive , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> paper industry needs to catch up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> industry .
     Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , there have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> mergers and acquisitions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paper industry , he said .

     Private industry 's labor costs rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , matching the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX> pace , as health insurance costs continued to soar , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> said .
     The increase in wage and benefit costs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> was greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> rise reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1988</TIMEX> .
     `` Wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning to curl upward a little bit , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audrey Freedman</ENAMEX> , a labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Conference Board</ENAMEX> , a business research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> .
     `` One would have thought this would have happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two or three years ago</TIMEX> as the labor market tightened .
     It is a considerably delayed reaction and it 's not a severe one at all , '' she added .
     The new data underscored the severity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's health-care cost problem .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in September</TIMEX> , wages and salaries of private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</NUMEX> , while health insurance costs spurted by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.7 %</NUMEX> .
     The consumer price index climbed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 %</NUMEX> in the same period .
     Despite the big increases in health-care costs , wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs .
     The overall private-sector employment cost index , which includes both wages and benefits , rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in September</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</NUMEX> for both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in June</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended September 1988</TIMEX> .
     Labor costs are climbing at a far more rapid pace in the health care industry than in other industries .
     For instance , wages of private-sector hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> leaped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in September</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in all industries .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , wages and salaries in all private industry rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> increases in both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of 1988</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> have n't managed to win wage increases as large as those granted to nonunion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> .
     For private-sector union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , the cost of wages and benefits rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> .
     For nonunion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , the costs rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</NUMEX> .
     Labor costs continued to rise more rapidly in service industries than in goods-producing industries , the report showed .
     It also found them rising much more in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Northeast</ENAMEX> than elsewhere .
     Including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees of</ENAMEX> state and local -- but not the federal -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">governments</ENAMEX> , the employment cost index rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 %</NUMEX> rise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the same quarter in 1988</TIMEX> .
     The index rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in September</TIMEX> , this index was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.1 %</NUMEX> .
     It rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in June</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 12 months ended in September 1988</TIMEX> .

     A shiny new takeover deal sparked a big rally in stock prices , which buoyed the dollar .
     Bond prices also edged higher .

     The dollar drew strength from the stock market 's climb .
     Long-term bond prices rose despite trepidation about what a key economic report will show <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> broke the pall that settled over the takeover business for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past three weeks</TIMEX> in the wake of the collapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp .</ENAMEX> buy-out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> soared <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.125</NUMEX> a share , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 62.875</NUMEX> , substantially above the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 58</NUMEX> a share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> is offering .
     That indicates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> are betting a higher offer is in the wings .
     Prices of other paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> rose sharply , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.50</NUMEX> a share , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50.875</NUMEX> .
     Despite all the furor over program trading , program trading played a big role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's rally .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> point out that as the big brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> back out of program trading for their own accounts or for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> , opportunities increase for others to engage in the controversial practice .
     That 's what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The rally notwithstanding , there are plenty of worries about the short-term course of stock prices .
     A slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> eases interest rates soon to stimulate the economy , profits could remain disappointing .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's major economic news -- a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 %</NUMEX> rise in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> index of leading economic indicators -- had little impact on financial markets .
     But the next important piece of news on the economy 's health -- this morning 's release of the national purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> 's survey for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October</TIMEX> -- could prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> into action .
     A report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late yesterday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX>-area purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> survey showed increased economic activity in that part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> cut into bond-price gains .
     If the national survey confirms a pickup in the manufacturing sector , it could further depress bond prices while bolstering stock prices and the dollar .
     Meanwhile , bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are laboring under the onus of a national debt ceiling debate .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> is expected to announce details of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> refunding operation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 79</TIMEX> schedule could be delayed unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> act soon to lift the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's debt ceiling .
     In major market activity :
     Stock prices rallied in active trading .
     Volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">176.1 million</NUMEX> shares .
     Advancing issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> surged ahead of decliners <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,111</NUMEX> to
     Bond prices rose .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a quarter</NUMEX> of a point , or less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.50</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> of face amount .
     The yield on the issue slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.91 %</NUMEX> .
     The dollar gained against most foreign currencies .
     In late afternoon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading , the dollar was at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8415 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.85 yen</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8340 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</NUMEX> late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> did n't specify reasons for the strong earnings gain .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bouygues</ENAMEX> said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first-half</TIMEX> profit is n't indicative of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full-year</TIMEX> trend because of the highly seasonal nature of many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's activities .
     For all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bouygues</ENAMEX> had consolidated profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">519 million francs</NUMEX> , after payments to minority interests , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 billion francs</NUMEX> .
