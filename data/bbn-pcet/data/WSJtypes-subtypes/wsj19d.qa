     As part of what a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> termed an `` amiable agreement , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Prospect Group</ENAMEX> will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of data management equipment .

     Though the play clearly is framed around the events of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> , it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past 30 years</TIMEX> .
     In fact , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merry Chase</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melinda Mullins</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a cool , carefully coiffed television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> , recites a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> or more scandals of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , concluding with those affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> and the savings and loan industry .
     Onstage , a congressional hearing is in progress , complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> in the background .
     The witness table is center stage and below it , the paraphernalia for the ever-present media , in this case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TNN</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Total News Network</ENAMEX> .
     Not only are there camera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> on all sides , but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater .
     The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> clearly feels that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a congressional hearing -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interrogators</ENAMEX> and the news media -- are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> .
     As the story of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Mastergate</ENAMEX> '' unfolds , we learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> confiscated one of the properties of a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> who owes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> in taxes .
     The man , it seems , has a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Lichtenstein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> , licensed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Libya</ENAMEX> and sheltered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bahamas</ENAMEX> .
     He himself lives in a `` consecutive series of unnumbered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Switzerland</ENAMEX> . ''
     The property seized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> film <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Master Pictures Incorporated</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">MPI</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     Supposedly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> will sell off the assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MPI</ENAMEX> , but before it can , a lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is called into the hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wylie Slaughter</ENAMEX> , the dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> .
     The lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel Lamb</ENAMEX> , who as you might guess , is being led to the slaughter , is ordered to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> .
     Soon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> is producing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> picture called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tet , the Motion Picture</ENAMEX> , '' to distinguish it from `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tet , the Offensive</ENAMEX> , '' as well as `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tet , the Book</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Tet , the Album</ENAMEX> . ''
     The picture , to be made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">San Elvador</ENAMEX> , is a cover for sending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 800 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">arms</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Los Otros</ENAMEX> , the rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> attempting to regain neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Ambigua</ENAMEX> , which has been taken over by the leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Overtega</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">podiatrist</ENAMEX> , who leads a revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of foot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> handling all this for the now-deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slaughter</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manley Battle</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> 's stand in for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Engler</ENAMEX> has assembled a top-flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> to carry out the impersonations of well-known political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> and to play the stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> who invariably show up at congressional hearings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel von Bargen</ENAMEX> is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Weiss</ENAMEX> is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> who serves as a friendly interrogator of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zach Grenier</ENAMEX> is maddeningly officious playing a succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Daly</ENAMEX> has the perfect `` aw , shucks '' demeanor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in his portrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann McDonough</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-rate as a succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> .
     With one she is pregnant , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> she is knitting an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag , and as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> she rushes in with white hair , wearing a tailored suit and pearls , imitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX> 's gestures down to the last detail .
     Though it 's clear that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> 's sympathies do not lie with the far right , it 's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs , taking sharp aim at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> of all stripes and particularly at the media .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> also has fun with language .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Mastergate</ENAMEX> '' is subtitled `` a play on words , '' and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> plays that game as well as anyone .
     He describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Mastergate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flunky</ENAMEX> as one who experienced a `` meteoric disappearance '' and found himself `` handling blanket appeals at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Bureau of Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> . ''
     This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness , however .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> deplores the obfuscation , the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides .
     As the hearings begin , the self-important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowman</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kilty</ENAMEX> -RRB- announces : `` Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset : We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> himself speaks in pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Pentagonese</ENAMEX> : `` Without further monetary-stroke-military aid , scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Ambiguan</ENAMEX> freedom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> , who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us , were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle . ''
     At another point he intones : `` Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy . ''
     The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> is short -- <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">95 minutes</TIMEX> without an intermission -- but even so , as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> 's satire loses its sharpness as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> pop up ever more predictably .
     Most of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> , though , is filled with rare and welcome wit .
     In `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Mastergate</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> has provided us not just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> commodities that have all but disappeared from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Broadway</ENAMEX> theater : sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language .

     Its many lively stories include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreund</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postel</ENAMEX> holiday cheer imbroglio .
     These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> New Crowd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> lived in the same apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">penthouse</ENAMEX> perched on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">duplex</ENAMEX> .
     The penthouse elevator started up from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">landing</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Gutfreund</ENAMEX> used to turn off its light , to give the impression that there was no higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">floor</ENAMEX> .
     Eventually , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postel</ENAMEX> broke his toe in the dark .
     Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreunds</ENAMEX> determined to put up a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">22-foot</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> , weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">a quarter of a ton</NUMEX> , to amaze their holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> .
     For this , a crane needed to be mounted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postels</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">terrace</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postels</ENAMEX> did not give permission .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> went ahead anyway , only to be captured `` in flagrante '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Postel</ENAMEX> , who called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> .
     Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreunds</ENAMEX> finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">duplex</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mansion</ENAMEX> with a specially excavated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garage</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postels</ENAMEX> had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> , and in a neighborly spirit hit both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreunds</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 35 million</NUMEX> lawsuit .
     Nothing less , it seemed , could console them for their traumas .
     Where had all the money come from ?
     The young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gutfreund</ENAMEX> had been discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Salomon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX> when he was still a bearded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> , and put to work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> , and then as a rough-and-tumble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syndicator</ENAMEX> .
     `` ` Get off your ... , ' he would bellow , '' say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> .
     Rising in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , he became powerful and bland , though his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> , made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks .
     After he had been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">3 1\/2 years</TIMEX> , he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> sold it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phibro</ENAMEX> , a powerful commodity trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outfit</ENAMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 550 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phibro</ENAMEX> stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Limited</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Salomon</ENAMEX> , whose family name had been on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's door for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">70 years</TIMEX> and who had hoped it would be there forever , was not consulted .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> collected <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32 million</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Salomon</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> , much less than if he had conducted the sale .
     `` I felt betrayed , '' he later said .
     Worse , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> 's timing had been off .
     Its profits , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phibro</ENAMEX> 's , soared over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two years</TIMEX> , and had it held out , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> could have gotten an even bigger bundle .
     The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lehman Bros.</ENAMEX> and other grand old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Often the genteel , conservative , long-term-oriented investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> were displaced by crude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> : `` When angered , he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lehman </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Glucksman</ENAMEX> .
     The earlier generation of `` our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belmonts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warburgs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehmans</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiffs</ENAMEX> -- had stressed above all probity , tradition , continuity and reputation .
     They were old-fashioned elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> , who happened to be of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> extraction .
     But in the harsh world of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoo</ENAMEX> prefers the nests of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and heaves out their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> .
     But the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> hired the New Crowd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> : It brought in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoos</ENAMEX> .
     So , as the Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crowd</ENAMEX> toppled from the branch , it should n't have been too surprised .
     The old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> had every right , however , to disdain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> ' new ways of making money , such as greenmail .
     -LRB- A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> article on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX> was entitled , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms</ENAMEX> . '' -RRB-
     Their other staple has been corporate takeovers , often hostile and financed by junk bonds .
     Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon .
     Sometimes they are constructive , but often not .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> , by making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> focus on short-term results , they inhibit building for the future -- just the opposite of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> , a long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder</ENAMEX> of a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> need n't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily : It will bounce back .
     But if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> takes over when the stock is weak , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder</ENAMEX> never gets his recovery .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , have evolved their own pattern for spending their new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> .
     As described in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">The New Crowd</ENAMEX> , '' they take on ambitious new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> , move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Bedford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , buy OK pictures , and let their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> share the wealth with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decorators</ENAMEX> .
     Having donated heavily to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museums</ENAMEX> , they demand a place on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">boards</ENAMEX> .
     The book is patronizing about this nouveau riche struggle for respectability , which has its tawdry aspects .
     However , on balance , the charity game helps <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> .
     If those who have the money do n't get involved with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museums</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> , then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">City Hall</ENAMEX> will do it , badly .
     It has been rightly observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is , t' ai nt enough of it .
     A handful of the New Crowd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal , and have ended up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">slammer</ENAMEX> or paying huge fines :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Levine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Siegel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Posner</ENAMEX> , and now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX> .
     The glitzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX> vacated for a prison <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">cell</ENAMEX> had previously contained commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Rich</ENAMEX> and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinky '' Green</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fugitives</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a potential century</TIMEX> apiece of jail sentences .
     The Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crowd</ENAMEX> is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this .
     However , the phenomenon is not specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Jewish</ENAMEX> .
     It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in , and that a few will cut corners in the process .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">piker</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Gould</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Fiske</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commodore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanderbilt</ENAMEX> thought nothing of bribing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> .
     So who knows ?
     In a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> some of the New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crowd</ENAMEX> may attain true respectability , perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raptors</ENAMEX> .
     Or perhaps Wall Street , when it has suffered enough , will realize that finance is a service industry , and change its ethos .

     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX> reported a staggering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 424.3 million</NUMEX> loss and replaced its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> a letter saying : `` We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Amazing Comeback at Wang</ENAMEX> . ' ''
     How soon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketer</ENAMEX> can face : selling the products of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that is on the ropes .
     `` If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , you 've lost it before you 've begun , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Ann Cluggish</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wellesley</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> who works with high technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     It can happen in any industry .
     Consider the difficulties faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Audi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> ' problems in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Valdez</ENAMEX> oil spill .
     Like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> before them , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's are finding ways to combat the bad news .
     `` It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Miller</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lowell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , in a video message to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a month</TIMEX> after he took over .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts .
     Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising .
     After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reported red ink for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fiscal third quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">department</ENAMEX> provided the sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> answers to questions such as `` How could you not have known you were going to lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million</NUMEX> ? '' and `` Is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> still a viable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> ? ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Salespeople</ENAMEX> try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances .
     Responding to such questions is `` defensive , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Olissa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , marketing .
     `` That 's antithetical to the art of selling . ''
     Moreover , he notes that analyzing financial results `` poses a problem for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet . ''
     At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sales strategy meeting , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> suggested ordering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> report .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> vetoed that : `` Even I ca n't understand all the footnotes , '' he says .
     Instead , he says , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> can get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customers</ENAMEX> to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's products on their merits , he or a top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financial officer</ENAMEX> will try to assuage the fears about finances .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Metschan</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Austin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , has a breezier method : `` We tell them <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> do n't go out of business .
     We tell them all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are having financial difficulties . ''
     Numerous computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's or are carrying such a large debt load .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says that after a sharp sales slump in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> , sales stabilized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> will report a loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first quarter ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the full fiscal year</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says he expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will return to profitability by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> must walk a fine line .
     `` If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Palmatier</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Minden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nev.</ENAMEX> , sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Marketing Edge</ENAMEX> . ''
     Still , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sullivan</ENAMEX> , a management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruiter</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daniel Roberts Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> , who has held senior sales positions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atari</ENAMEX> : `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> will react to strength .

     That is n't easy .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are data processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who want to be sure that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers</ENAMEX> are stable , wellrun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> to come .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> , `` these are career-risking decisions , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Conlin</ENAMEX> , who supervises a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> computers in the admissions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Boston University</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> is considering installing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250,000</NUMEX> system to store applications electronically .
     `` Before the really bad news , we were looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> fairly seriously , '' she says .
     But `` their present financial condition means I 'd have a hard time convincing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in charge of purchasing . ''
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conlin</ENAMEX> adds : `` At some point we 'd have to ask , ` How do we know that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> you wo n't be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> ? ' ''
     During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's overall product line is `` still not as good as other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">vendors</ENAMEX> , but they 've come a long way , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Wendler</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> with market researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gartner Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Stamford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn .</ENAMEX>
     `` They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this bad quarter</TIMEX> happened . ''
     The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> priority for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is to make sure it holds on to existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> remain extremely loyal .

     New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> , the source of higher commissions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX> and the key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's long-term viability , are even tougher .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lynch</ENAMEX> , a former top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> , referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 's mainstay computer line , says : `` You ca n't sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">VS</ENAMEX> to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> .

     Earlier rate reductions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> reduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> 's revenue and operating profit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 55 million</NUMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization .

     Electrical products ' sales fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 496.7 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 504.5 million</NUMEX> with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">South America</ENAMEX> .
     Operating profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37.2 million</NUMEX> was unchanged .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Akerson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> sees further improvements in operating margins .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> 's Reach Out America plan .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">MCI</ENAMEX> claims <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 %</NUMEX> of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 billion</NUMEX> residential market .
