     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> 's big defense and automotive electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM Hughes Electronics</ENAMEX> , said net income fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , reflecting declining military spending and slumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> production .
     Meanwhile , net at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arm</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Acceptance Corp.</ENAMEX> , fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX> .
     By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's data processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , boosted net <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> closed down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.875</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.875</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Earnings for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> common stock , reflecting the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's core automotive operations , will be disclosed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> Class H , which represents a dividend interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> earnings , closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> Class E , which represents a dividend interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EDS</ENAMEX> profit , fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 52.25</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     The earnings drop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM Hughes Electronics</ENAMEX> is a sign of tough times at both the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hughes Aircraft Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , which are a primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">customer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delco Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM Hughes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     Profit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 110.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 142.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45 cents</NUMEX> a share , largely because of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 24 million</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-time charge associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year end</TIMEX> .
     Even excluding the charge , however , net fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> production fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> , which hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delco Electronic</ENAMEX> 's earnings , a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     That decline was reflected in revenue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM Hughes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , which edged down to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.58 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.63 billion</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM Hughes</ENAMEX> net fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.6 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 486.6 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.48</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 521 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.58</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.47 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.18 billion</NUMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> , net dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 234.5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 241.9 million</NUMEX> .
     The finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> said its automotive financing and leasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , largely because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> incentives used to boost sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> profits are combined with earnings from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's operations and attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's traditional common stock .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> 's earnings fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 859.5 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 930.2 million</NUMEX> .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EDS </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> profit jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 110.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">93 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.37 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.22 billion</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EDS</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 315.8 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.62</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 280.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.30</NUMEX> a share .
     Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.03 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.54 billion</NUMEX> .
     Revenue from non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> accounts was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EDS </ENAMEX>'s total business in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest nine months</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has said it wants to boost non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> revenue to at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> of its total business by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1990</TIMEX> .

     In the bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating Co.</ENAMEX> raised its proposed offer to one it valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.29 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.19 billion</NUMEX> , apparently topping all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> .
     The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> 's reorganization .
     They are also indirectly subject to approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization .
     Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parties</ENAMEX> bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> proposes a complex financial package to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> .
     The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Yacos</ENAMEX> , the bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> overseeing the case , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX> , unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> each are currently backing different plans .
     In addition , some of the proposals are so close , that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role .
     The unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> agreed in principle to support <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Haven</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> 's new bid .
     They previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> .
     All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> contemplate full payment including interest to secured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> 's plan , however , offers more for unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Kalmus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to the official creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> , said that under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> plan , unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> would be paid in full credits and interest of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 855 million</NUMEX> , accrued before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 1988</TIMEX> filing for bankruptcy court protection .
     In addition , they would receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 200 million</NUMEX> in payments for interest since then .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kalmus</ENAMEX> said that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next July</TIMEX> they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> .
     Other plans generally would n't pay unsecured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> ' interest accrued since the filing .
     Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> 's plan , a new holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> would be formed to own the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     It would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX>-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>-owned by current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> preferred and common stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> also would get certain debentures and preferred stock .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> said the preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> total package would equal <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 %</NUMEX> of their claims .
     Common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> would end up owning <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 6.4 %</NUMEX> of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     As previously reported , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hartford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> filed a bid it valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.25 billion</NUMEX> .
     That offer was endorsed by the shareholders <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">committee</ENAMEX> .
     The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">New England Electric System</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Westboro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , did n't change the value of their bids , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> changed its rate proposal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New England Electric</ENAMEX> values its offer at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> values its reorganization plan at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     The bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to circumvent state regulation .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bidders</ENAMEX> alike concede that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> has endorsed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New England Electric</ENAMEX> plan , which promises to limit rate increases to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX> ' plan proposes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> annual increases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> amended its plan to call for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> rate increases followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 %</NUMEX> increases .
     Fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases , however .
     Previously it had proposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> increases .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> also amended its rate plan .
     The new offer assumes just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> rate increases , to be followed by state-approved increases under the usual hearing procedure .
     Previously <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> had also called for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> increases .
     The bids and rate proposals generally assume the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Seabrook</ENAMEX> nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which is completed , will go into operation .
     Most of the plans have reduced bids in case the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> fails to get a license from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Nuclear Regulatory Commission </ENAMEX>.
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 1\/2</NUMEX> debenture due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2004</TIMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 82.50</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">utility</ENAMEX> 's stock closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</NUMEX> a share , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> , in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> .
     In a separate development , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> severance agreements that would pay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">one to three years</TIMEX> ' salary if their jobs were changed or they were dismissed in the wake of a takeover .
     It said the maximum cost of the plan would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.7 million</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> had n't noticed that his new desk had just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> telephone lines and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> phone .
     It was , after all , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only his second full day</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> .
     But the lack of lines became painfully apparent .
     As the stock market lurched into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point free fall on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> found himself scurrying around the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> -- from his desk , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> was on an open line , to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> was connected , to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> , where a computer monitored market moves .
     With other anxious calls pouring in , he recalls , `` I 'd either have to disconnect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> or go out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> 's desk . ''
     It wo n't happen again .
     Now there are more lines connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> , and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk .
     It 's all part of a new `` command <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">center</ENAMEX> . ''
     The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> 's stance as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's top securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> .
     Like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> , he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office .
     But unlike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruder</ENAMEX> , who during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> is turning the market drop to his own advantage , using it to further his agenda for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> .
     In an interview and in congressional testimony , he repeatedly points to the recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> and to track big trades in the market .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> of another financial crisis , the savings-and-loan bailout , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> wants to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> regulate securities issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">S&amp;Ls</ENAMEX> .
     More broadly , he wants to `` modernize '' regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> compete in the global market .
     He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs , an area the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> does n't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Also unlike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruder</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda .
     As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> who worked closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , he is savvy in the ways of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
     What 's more , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the coming months</TIMEX> likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> , enabling him to avoid the dissension that frustrated his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">39-year-old</TIMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets .
     For instance , he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks .
     He may be waiting to see the results of several pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules .
     He also has kept a close wrap on the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">commission</ENAMEX> , a job vacant since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the summer</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> 's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> 's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> seems likely to let the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> have his way for a while .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> know Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> from working on the thrift-bailout bill , and the relationship generally remains warm .
     Indeed , during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> 's confirmation hearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> asked him to introduce his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">These days</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> is winning praise in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday-the-13th</TIMEX> market plunge and the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's harrowing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> session .
     As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> charged with restoring investor confidence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agencies</ENAMEX> .
     Not everyone has jumped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> bandwagon , however .
     Some in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> contend that it 's too soon to tell whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> will help or hinder the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't think this was a real test , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> .
     `` It was a fairly stressful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekend</TIMEX> , but my sense is if you had n't had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> there , it would n't have made much of a difference . ''
     For some at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> that covets its independence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> may be too much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> .
     They note that he has adorned his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">office</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them featuring the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dog</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Millie</ENAMEX> .
     They worry that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> also will roll over when told to do so by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> already has shown an eagerness to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> his way .
     During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> market rebound , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> that the industrial average had turned down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> points .
     Stunned , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> turned to his market-monitoring computer , which by then was next to his desk .
     It showed the DJIA up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> points .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quotron</ENAMEX> , had miscalculated the industrial average .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">SEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> to inform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> that it was airing the wrong number .
     `` It was the plunge that did n't happen , '' he says .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake -- to move another rule change past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     That disaster closed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pacific Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 's stock options-trading operation , forcing those options to be switched to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> temporarily .
     Though obscure to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> , the question of whether to list options on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has aroused much interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , mainly because regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> fear the change could bankrupt them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressmen</ENAMEX> raised the issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at a hearing .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> , not missing a chance to press his agenda , cited the earthquake .
     That event , he contended , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .

     In a corner of the cavernous , new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Nippon Convention Center</ENAMEX> sits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> 's advanced-technology display .
     The highlight : a `` fragrance control system . ''
     With the touch of a button , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> can choose from lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents , all blown in through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> 's air-conditioning system .
     The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> hopes to move the system out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">lab</ENAMEX> and into its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .
     Welcome to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">28th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Tokyo Motor Show .</ENAMEX>
     Here you can find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> displaying a `` live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> transporter , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> akin to an aquarium on wheels , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> with its `` keyless '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Boga</ENAMEX> , whose doors unlock upon recognizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> 's fingerprints .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suzuki Motor Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Escudome</ENAMEX> sport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> features a pop-out rear tent and invites <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> to go `` back to the nature . ''
     But this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">biennial</TIMEX> event , the world 's largest display of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> , has its serious side , including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle-suspension systems .
     It 's also the prime showcase for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged , and therein lies the draw .
     Even the biggest auto shows in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> are largely regional affairs , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> show is international .
     Virtually every automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> showed up .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> flights were booked solid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Motor City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald E. Petersen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Greenwald</ENAMEX> , flocked to see the future .
     Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> came , for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">24 years</TIMEX> , to show off its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Lada Niva</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> .
     Here 's a firsthand look at what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> sported , and what the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> saw .
     New Technology
     The hottest displays were items that insulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">road</ENAMEX> .
     These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> 's ride .
     Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> , in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cheetah</ENAMEX> , and equates the various parts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> grandly touted its system in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> that splits in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> says it will introduce its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> system <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next month</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Q45</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">sedan</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Celica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">coupe</ENAMEX> will go on sale with the suspension device <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next spring</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> must wait : The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> say their systems are still under development .
     In the engine department , several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> displayed experimental models that within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a decade</TIMEX> could provide power equal to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's engines and yet take up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> the space , allowing for shorter hoods .
     In the so-called <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-stroke engines , which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage , each piston goes up and down only once to provide power .
     By contrast , the pistons in conventional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-stroke engine displays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fuji Heavy Industries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Subaru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , drew plenty of interest from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , who are rushing to develop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-stroke engines .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> shows a more conventional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-cylinder engine in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Accord Inspire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">model</ENAMEX> , which made its debut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">just this month</TIMEX> -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> only .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> says the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-cylinder , and the power of a V-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> .
     It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Acura</ENAMEX> line in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would n't comment .
     Odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">Cars</ENAMEX> , Funny Names
     There 's plenty of whimsy here , but it is n't always clear whether it 's intentional .
     The show 's symbol is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> riding on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sponsors</ENAMEX> have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> , '' they say , `` important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are known for coming up with funny names , but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> has a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">motorcycle</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Monkey</ENAMEX> , and a slightly larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cousin</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gorilla</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> has a futuristic delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Guppy</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Bongo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> and , under its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Autozam</ENAMEX> nameplate , a `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">microvan</ENAMEX> '' called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Scrum</ENAMEX> .
     Its buglike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Carol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">minicar</ENAMEX> is `` designed with softness , gentleness and warmheartedness . ''
     But the court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jester</ENAMEX> appears to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daihatsu Motor Co .</ENAMEX>
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of its futuristic concepts is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bubblelike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Sneaker</ENAMEX> , which seats just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in front and could hold a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and bag of groceries in the rear .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daihatsu</ENAMEX> also has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Fellow 90</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Leeza Spider</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Hijet Dumbo</ENAMEX> .
     The jokes are n't just on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , though .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Regie Nationale des Usines Renault</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> , has a concept <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Megane </ENAMEX>.
     The name is supposed to connote feminine grandeur , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> it means `` eyeglasses . ''
     Foreign Presence
     Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> are taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Tokyo Motor Show</ENAMEX> more seriously than ever .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">AB Volvo</ENAMEX> invites <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX> to play `` the role of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummy</ENAMEX> '' by hopping in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> that simulates a crash to show just how its seat-belt tightener works .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hyundai Motor Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">South Korea</ENAMEX> has its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-ever exhibit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> is sponsoring its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> independent display in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> , and it includes a boxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Buick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">station wagon</ENAMEX> with wood-grain side panels .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> with the less-popular automotive parts section .
     `` We 've got to get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> mentality and be part of the world mentality , '' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles M. Jordan </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for design , in explaining his pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Tokyo Show</ENAMEX> .
     Even so , traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> cockiness is n't terribly endangered .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , for example , crowed about their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-ever <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Tokyo Grand Prix</ENAMEX> racing victory .
     True , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> was declared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">winner</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , but only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> who crossed the finish line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was disqualified because it hit another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and skid momentarily out of bounds .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , still criticizes <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> styling .
     `` It 's hard for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> , '' he says , `` to get a feeling in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , to get a passion in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> , to get emotion in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> .

     Regarding your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 28</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Politics &amp; Policy</ENAMEX> column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ?
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> maintain that a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings .
     This is a classic example of the old saying , `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ''
     It 's ridiculous for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with taxable income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50,000</NUMEX> to pay the same <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 %</NUMEX> incremental tax rate as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with taxable income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250,000</NUMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 %</NUMEX> bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> rate adjustment amount .
     It 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> would n't estimate the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wardair</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> , which include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">A310-300s</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747-100s</ENAMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Ireland</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX>-based technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Avmark Inc.</ENAMEX> , an aircraft evaluation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , estimated the total `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-life '' value of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:OTHER">planes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 650 million</NUMEX> or more .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> DC10-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> also said it plans to sell , beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , have a current <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-life value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 34 million</NUMEX> each , or a total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 374 million</NUMEX> , raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> said current demand for used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> is strong , partly because surging orders for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> have lengthened waiting lists .
     He predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> would have little difficulty attracting prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     Under its revised fleet plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> said it will also increase its existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">fleet</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767-300ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> , and add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747-400s</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1994</TIMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">units</ENAMEX> that it previously planned to add by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">767-300ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> scheduled for delivery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> would be leased out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two to five years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> estimated it at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 450 million -LRB- US</NUMEX> -RRB- , excluding replacement costs for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">DC10-30</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> plans to sell , and purchase costs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">320-200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> previously ordered .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PWA</ENAMEX> 's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$ 1.24 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of the second quarter</TIMEX> , nearly double <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier</TIMEX> figure , reflecting debt absorbed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wardair</ENAMEX> purchase .

     The recent bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> have led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managements</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said he and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> endorse a bill by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Neal </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.C.</ENAMEX> -RRB- that would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> .
     `` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX> 's monetary policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">subcommittee</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> opposed a bill - introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reps.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hamilton</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ind.</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Dorgan</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.D.</ENAMEX> -RRB- -- that , among other things , would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> .
     In responding to questions , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> played down reports of tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> over exchange-rate policy .
     `` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said .
     He did n't elaborate .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> is n't enthusiastic about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> is frustrated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said the inflation rate , currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4 1\/2 %</NUMEX> , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . ''
     In other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan </ENAMEX>, who has repeatedly said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . ''
     He warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to borrow heavily .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX> 's bill originally called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to reduce the inflation rate by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point a year for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">five years</TIMEX> and to maintain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> inflation rate thereafter .
     He altered the wording to win Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's endorsement .
     Even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reps</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorgan</ENAMEX> also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> that makes monetary policy .
     Instead , the bill simply calls for twice-a-year meetings between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> and top administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     Even that met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> 's disapproval because it might subject the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> `` to a more intensely political perspective '' and `` could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals . ''
     While each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorgan</ENAMEX> proposals represents only a small step , together they would erode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's independence , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy , he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tax Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> and result in higher marginal income tax rates .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemicals</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's food supply .
     The proposed changes , which are scheduled to be announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , would apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">substances</ENAMEX> found on fresh and processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">foods</ENAMEX> , according to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">groups</ENAMEX> have been calling for faster action on dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> and may welcome part of the proposal .
     But they are already objecting to , among other things , a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a tremendous disappointment , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Hathaway</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> .
     `` Allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> to condone continued use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> . ''

     There already are proposals pending in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> to overhaul pesticide law .
     Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> gained new impetus during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Alar</ENAMEX> scare , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">carcinogen</ENAMEX> , a growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">regulator</ENAMEX> used to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">apples</ENAMEX> redder and crunchier .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> has since acted to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Alar</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's grocery shelves by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May 31 , 1991</TIMEX> , and the apple industry has said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">growers</ENAMEX> already have stopped using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> .
     In addition , the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Delaney</ENAMEX> Paradox .
     Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Delaney</ENAMEX> clause , which applies to processed food , a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> is banned if it causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> .
     Under other laws applying to pesticide use , however , that same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">chemical</ENAMEX> could be allowed to be used on fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> if it fell within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> 's tolerance level .
     Among other changes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> wants to :
     -- Give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> more flexibility to declare a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticide</ENAMEX> an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace .
     -- Speed up the process for removing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticide</ENAMEX> that is n't an imminent hazard .
     -- Bar <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticide</ENAMEX> once the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has set a standard .
     -- Give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> added discretion to set `` negligible risk '' levels for pesticide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">residues</ENAMEX> in processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Chemicals</ENAMEX> that exceed these risk levels would be barred , but those that fall below these levels would be allowed .
     -- Allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EPA</ENAMEX> to permit the continued use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">pesticides</ENAMEX> that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost .

     Financial markets took a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">midweek</TIMEX> break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly , bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.94</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2653.28</NUMEX> in moderate trading .
     Long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.52 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bonds offered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's bailout of the savings and loan industry .
     The dollar was barely changed against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> mark and up marginally against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> yen .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> after the proposed buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> once again collapsed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said the stock market 's lurching moves have prompted many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability .
     Although bond prices were n't as volatile on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> trading as stock prices , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> nevertheless said action also was much slower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market .
     Bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> paid close attention to comments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan </ENAMEX>, who was testifying before a congressional hearing , but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> 's monetary policy .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are expecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Fed</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates at least once more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">before the end of the year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> now are awaiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's release of the preliminary estimate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> gross national product .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> predict the report will show economic growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , which would have little effect on financial markets .
     But an unexpected deviation either way could roil bond and currency markets .
     In major market activity :
     Stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading .
     Volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155.7 million</NUMEX> shares .
     But advancing issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> were ahead of decliners <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">784</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> .
     Bond prices inched higher .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> issue rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than an eighth</NUMEX> of a point , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 1.25</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> of face amount .
     The yield on the issue stood at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.88 %</NUMEX> .
     The dollar was virtually unchanged .
     In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> trading the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency was quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8353 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.52 yen</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8355 marks</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.45 yen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> , I was on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">panel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> that discussed the `` image '' of intercollegiate athletics for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of campus information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and others .
     We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribblers</ENAMEX> quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports richly earned , but also that it could be corrected .
     Competition could be maintained -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">stadiums</ENAMEX> probably would remain full -- if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> , we said .
     Comments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> reflected widespread , if wistful , agreement with those conclusions .
     As the session broke up , I was approached by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who identified himself as the alumni <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of a Big Ten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> .
     `` I 'd love to see sports cut back , and so would a lot of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> at other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> , but everybody 's afraid to make the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> move , '' he confided .
     `` It 's like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> : Nobody wants to disarm <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> . ''
     And so our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">institutions</ENAMEX> of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , while the casualties mount .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> new books make the point that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large price of the glittery college-sports show can be the integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> that stage it .
     They are : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">A Payroll to Meet : A Story of Greed , Corruption and Football at SMU</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">221</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Whitford</ENAMEX> ; `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Big Red Confidential : Inside Nebraska Football</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Contemporary</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.95</NUMEX> -RRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armen Keteyian</ENAMEX> ; and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Never Too Young to Die : The Death of Len Bias</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pantheon</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252</NUMEX> pages , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 18.95</NUMEX> -RRB- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Cole</ENAMEX> .
     The pick of the group is `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Payroll</ENAMEX> '' ; it should be required reading for every college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     It chronicles how , over a period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Southern Methodist University</ENAMEX> bought its way to football respectability in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Southwest Conference</ENAMEX> , only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete-payoff system it created .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , to receive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCAA</ENAMEX> 's `` death penalty '' -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> -- for repeated rules violations .
     Given current headlines about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Florida</ENAMEX> , it may not be the last .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who brought the bribe to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Meyer</ENAMEX> , a flashy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sort</ENAMEX> who came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1975</TIMEX> to rescue a woebegone program , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitford</ENAMEX> writes .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer</ENAMEX> 's personal style was illustrated by his pinning a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 100</NUMEX> bill to a high-school bulletin board on which other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> tacked their cards .
     One <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruiter</ENAMEX> working with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer</ENAMEX> was so generous with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX> bills that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> sang `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">Here Comes Santa Claus</ENAMEX> '' when he approached .
     Paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">SMU</ENAMEX> was no casual operation .
     It involved the athletics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different football coaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> , and school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> -- just about everybody , it seemed , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Shields</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX> , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clements</ENAMEX> , then a university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> -LRB- and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> ! -RRB- and oil man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Cox</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustees</ENAMEX> .
     `` You stay out of it , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitford</ENAMEX> quotes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clements</ENAMEX> as saying .
     `` Go run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> . ''
     Which was about what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX> did , and quietly , until he resigned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few years later</TIMEX> , pleading ill health , when the stuff hit the fan .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitford</ENAMEX> drew on voluminous news media coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">SMU</ENAMEX> scandal , and on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> internal investigation .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keteyian</ENAMEX> had to do most of his own digging on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Nebraska</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> , which is , to date , high and dry as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NCAA</ENAMEX> is concerned .
     Unfortunately , he gets low grades as an investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> , relying heavily on what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. Daley</ENAMEX> , called `` insinuendo . ''
     Discrepancies go unexplained in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Confidential</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> claims he received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4,000 to $ 5,000</NUMEX> for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few hundred dollars</NUMEX> -RRB- , and when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keteyian</ENAMEX> ca n't nail down something , like who really owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> driven by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Husker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tailback</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Dubose</ENAMEX> , he simply reprints his notes .
     There are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Husker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> and a low-level female university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> .
     A serious charge -- that star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flanker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Fryar ``</ENAMEX> threw '' the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Orange Bowl</ENAMEX> game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone -- is included , even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Nebraska</ENAMEX> assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> quoted denied making it .
     Still , the book produces more smoke than a smoldering sofa , along with a few flames , especially concerning the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">steroids</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Steinkuhler</ENAMEX> , a spectacularly bulked-up former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lineman</ENAMEX> , confesses that he used 'em , and says other <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Huskers</ENAMEX> did too .
     It 's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Nebraska</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> .
     Probably , it did n't .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:BOOK">Never Too Young</ENAMEX> '' is a different sort of work , focusing on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> death from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">cocaine</ENAMEX> ingestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of Maryland</ENAMEX> basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> ticketed for sure pro stardom .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">university</ENAMEX> was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> , it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lefty Driesell</ENAMEX> , ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> died to be cleaned before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> could arrive -LRB- the order was n't carried out -RRB- , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> 's athletics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> issued false information about the academic standing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> .
     Those , of course , were the responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with something to hide .

     `` There are an increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there who are time-poor , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Vroom</ENAMEX> , retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Alex . Brown &amp; Sons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Baltimore</ENAMEX> .
     `` Those are primarily white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , a customer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> that has historically proved elusive for convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Convenience</ENAMEX> 's move is likely to be echoed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> , though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">7-Eleven</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Circle K Corp.</ENAMEX> are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland</ENAMEX> said that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchisees</ENAMEX> have been targeting their merchandise to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has begun to follow suit .
     For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Southland</ENAMEX> has expanded its bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">water</ENAMEX> selection in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and added fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sandwiches</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">outlets</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Several months ago</TIMEX> , it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     `` We certainly see an increasing trend toward that , '' she added .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Convenience</ENAMEX> said it has tested its new merchandise mix in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , with favorable results .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's effort will be helped by its decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> to put point-of-sale scanners in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> , allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Convenience</ENAMEX> to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't .
     To promote its new strategy , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Convenience</ENAMEX> said it plans to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 12 million</NUMEX> on advertising for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ending June 30</TIMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1989</TIMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">One day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed Inc.</ENAMEX> made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie , its stock did n't trade and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> forecast a `` significant '' drop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> in sales of its core product .
     That disclosure came , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said , after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> alerted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided .
     In addition to the forecast , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> would resume trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> stock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> , which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> announced the resignations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S.

Shapiro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> .
     They were succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fresenius USA Inc.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fresenius AG</ENAMEX> , which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 45 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Brunswick</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Medical Care Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Following that announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> , however , company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were unavailable to elaborate .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> products through the exclusive arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Medical</ENAMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21.1 million</NUMEX> .
     The current distribution arrangement ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 1990</TIMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Medical</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     Nonetheless , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> currently expects that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> sales ... will be significantly below their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> level , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said in a statement .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fresenius USA</ENAMEX> would begin distributing the product and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is investigating other possible distribution channels .
     In any case , supplies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> wo n't be interrupted , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> added .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fresenius</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> , has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 70 % and 80 %</NUMEX> .
     The transaction also would combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fresenius USA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> .
     But the plan now is being `` reformulated , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> said , declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination .
     Said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> : `` The whole structure has changed .
     The value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has changed . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> but less than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> originally expected .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> also would receive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> rights to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fresenius AG</ENAMEX> products .
     Another option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said , is that it could sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Ogden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Utah</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brooks Armored Car Service Inc.</ENAMEX> never wanted to get into money laundering .
     But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 5</TIMEX> , a thunderstorm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Wilmington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Del.</ENAMEX> , caused <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:RIVER">Shellpot Creek</ENAMEX> to rise <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">15 feet</NUMEX> , pouring <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">1.3 million gallons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> into basement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">vaults</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> destroyed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 75 million</NUMEX> in currency and caked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 million</NUMEX> of coins with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">mud</ENAMEX> , rendering them dangerous to counting machines .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</NUMEX> in paper money , although moldy , mildewy and smelly , was exchanged through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</ENAMEX> without incident .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> was unable to reach a coin-cleaning agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .
     `` We kind of got caught between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">bureaucracies</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Brooks Jr</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">U.S. Mint</ENAMEX> would n't take the coin because it was n't mutilated , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> accepts only clean coins , he says .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Philadelphia Fed</ENAMEX> says it is merely an `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agent</ENAMEX> '' for coins , responsible only for storage and distribution .
     `` We issue paper money ; we destroy paper money , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Hinkle</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Philadelphia Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> .
     `` The coin is their problem . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Mint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> offered to clean the coins for its `` bare-bones '' cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17,000</NUMEX> plus certain other expenses .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooks</ENAMEX> declined , figuring that transporting the mucked up money to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Washington</ENAMEX> would cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> more .
     So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooks</ENAMEX> gave the dirty work to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coin Wrap Inc.</ENAMEX> , which came up with an unusual solution .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> a day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two weeks</TIMEX> , in aggregates of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">as much as 27,000 pounds</NUMEX> -LRB- equaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> in pennies -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coin Wrap</ENAMEX> has been pouring money into a cement-mixing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> .
     A giant heater , working like a blowtorch , causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers .
     After clanging around for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or so , the shiny , hot money pours out of the cement chute , where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers .
     After cooling , the coins are then rewrapped .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> expects to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coin Wrap</ENAMEX> a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 20,000</NUMEX> -- a cost that insurance wo n't cover .
     And while the job is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> done , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> is still bitter .
     In fact , there 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> involved who 's happy , and that 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd String</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coin Wrap</ENAMEX> and conceiver of the cement-truck solution .
     Not only did his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> find <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> worth of work , but when the approach was suggested , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">String</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> `` did n't laugh at me or anything .

     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Parenthood</ENAMEX> , '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this summer</TIMEX> 's successful and amusing movie about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , apparently was only the beginning .
     It seems that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">every day</TIMEX> a new movie opens featuring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> coping with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> 's death , or adoption , or aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> , or pregnancy .
     And why not ?
     Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> -- from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truffaut</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fellini</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Allen</ENAMEX> -- have taken a cue from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chekhov</ENAMEX> : When it comes to compelling drama , there 's no place like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> .
     Yet too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> working in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Hollywood</ENAMEX> today seem to suffer from the delusion that the drama played out in every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> will be interesting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live somewhere else .
     This is not the case .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX> simply are n't worth snooping in .
     Yet there will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who will sob at `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Immediate Family</ENAMEX> , '' a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption .
     These are the sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> 's troubles , no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told .
     Written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Benedek </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-author</ENAMEX> of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Big Chill</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Immediate Family</ENAMEX> '' takes the position that only rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> should have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> .
     The film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging .
     Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Close</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Woods</ENAMEX> -RRB- and the teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> who decide to give up their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> for adoption -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Stuart Masterson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Dillon</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> -LRB- Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> -RRB- , who seem to be pushing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">40</TIMEX> , live in a large and tastefully decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> .
     All of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and they ca n't , so now they want a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> more than anything -- perhaps even more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> wanted his fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">convertible</ENAMEX> or his deluxe stereo equipment .
     The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them , since the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are shown to be rude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brats</ENAMEX> , in therapy by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">age five</TIMEX> .
     Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> decide to adopt .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one -- or maybe they 're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Kaplan</ENAMEX> 's -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Accused</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- dull direction .
     Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score ; when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:SONG">I Can See Clearly Now</ENAMEX> . ''
     The adoption <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">agency</ENAMEX> insists on introducing the adopting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to the birth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> , so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> pay for pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy</ENAMEX> 's -LRB- Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masterson</ENAMEX> -RRB- bus ticket from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> always from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> ?
     I ask this not necessarily as a native <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Ohioan</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy</ENAMEX> , of course , is pretty and smart , though uneducated .
     Everyone falls in love with everyone else .
     There is some pain , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> and `` did n't know she would feel like this '' and wants to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> .
     But in the end , everything turns out for the best , in the film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> ' warped view .
     Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in the hostile takeover field , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> goes where the money is .
     At the other end of the life cycle is `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary David Goldberg</ENAMEX> 's adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wharton</ENAMEX> novel .
     This picture is about a middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who makes sure that his delayed bond with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> dies .
     The glib emotional style Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> has perfected on television 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Family Ties</ENAMEX> '' does n't benefit from magnification .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> doing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">eight days</TIMEX> .
     They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> cataloging the sights they 've seen from the window of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">bus</ENAMEX> .
     Not even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Lemmon</ENAMEX> 's expert doddering makes this trip worth taking .
     So it 's entirely possible that `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Look Who 's Talking</ENAMEX> '' is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now .
     But by comparison , this fluffy comedy seems like a gem .
     It starts with conception , taking the sperm 's point of view , then progresses to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> 's point of view .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Willis</ENAMEX> 's best attribute as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> is his coy , lazy voice , and that 's all you get of him here , speaking for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> .
     Finally , there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stars</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bears</ENAMEX> .
     For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time , in a movie called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Bear</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Jacques Annaud</ENAMEX> demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be .

     Supposedly , he proposed the movie to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Berri </ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> lines :
     `` An orphan bear <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cub</ENAMEX> .
     A big solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in the forest .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> ' point of view . ''
     But then , even a great many words could n't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> who adopts a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parent</ENAMEX> .
