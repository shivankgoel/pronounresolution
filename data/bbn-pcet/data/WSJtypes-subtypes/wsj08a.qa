     The growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> buying up foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are n't all strait-laced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> in dark suits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasumichi Morishita</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> became a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christies International PLC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> , is one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who does n't fit the mold .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> , he 's known in racy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> as the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King of Shady Money</ENAMEX> . '' If nothing else , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57-year-old</TIMEX> 's past has its share of dents . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nearly 20 years ago</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aichi Corp.</ENAMEX> , a finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , received a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10-month</TIMEX> suspended sentence from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> for violating a money-lending law and an income tax law .
     He was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted , and attempting to evade income taxes by using a double accounting system . He 's had other brushes with the law .
     He was arrested , though not indicted , on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> other occasions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'70s</TIMEX> : for assault and unlawful confinement , for fraud and forgery of private documents , and for extortion .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christies</ENAMEX> says it has had no contact with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> since the stock purchase , but that it 's happy to deal with him . `` We like to make our own judgments '' about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Davidge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christies</ENAMEX> ' group managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> . `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have a different reputation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> is a leading figure among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38,000</NUMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machikin</ENAMEX> , '' which lend to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sarakin</ENAMEX> , '' which lend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> . Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> lend freely , often without demanding collateral .
     But the interest rates they charge are often near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.75 %</NUMEX> legal limit , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenji Utsunomiya</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> specializing in loan troubles .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aichi</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machikin</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utsunomiya</ENAMEX> says , and `` one of the nasty ones . ''
     In describing that business in general , he says that when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> ca n't repay the loan , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machikin</ENAMEX> `` clutch on like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hyenas</ENAMEX> '' and even take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> 's new gallery , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aska International Ltd.</ENAMEX> , purchased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.4 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christies</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 33 million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 53.3 million</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     Acquired from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Holmes a Court</ENAMEX> , the stake was apparently the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of its kind for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aska</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">entity</ENAMEX> separate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aichi</ENAMEX> . And the acquisition , which made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aska</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christies</ENAMEX> ' top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , left many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wondering who this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was and what his intentions were . `` We 're an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> says , sitting back in his purple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">gallery</ENAMEX> filled with some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Monets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Renoirs</ENAMEX> . `` In the long run , the -LCB- stock -RCB- prices will go up . '' It 's not clear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aska</ENAMEX> plans to buy more shares . But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Christies</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> insists , is happy to see him become a long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholder</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> considers himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">connoisseur</ENAMEX> of art . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30 years</TIMEX> of collecting impressionist and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> paintings , he has acquired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> items , he says , enough to persuade him to start a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:MUSEUM">museum</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     He says he spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 million</NUMEX> on his art business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A week ago</TIMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">gallery</ENAMEX> racked up a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 million</NUMEX> tab at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sotheby 's</ENAMEX> auction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> buying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> works , including a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PAINTING">Picasso</ENAMEX> . `` He makes snap judgments , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kiyotaka Kori</ENAMEX> , the art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">gallery</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than seven years</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> certainly appears to be thriving , although he wo n't disclose numbers . According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Teikoku Data Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> , which tracks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> earnings , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aichi </ENAMEX>'s revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49.3 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 348.4 million</NUMEX> -RRB- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year ended February</TIMEX> .
     Revenue doubled from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     That is , if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> reported results correctly . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Asahi Shimbun</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">daily</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last month</TIMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aichi</ENAMEX> revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a two-year</TIMEX> period .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Tokyo Regional Taxation Office</ENAMEX> declines to comment , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kori </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> , says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income . The small , wiry Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> comes across as an outspoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of the world . Stretching his arms in his silky white shirt and squeaking his black shoes , he lectures a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> about the way to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> real estate and boasts about his friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> . But when asked what exactly he does in business , he immediately takes offense .
     `` Are you stupid ? '' he snaps . `` You should know what questions to ask to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to answer . '' Not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know the details of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> 's business , but it 's a source of rumors about shady dealings . When a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> goes belly-up , for instance , the gossipy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazines</ENAMEX> are often quick to link the demise with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aichi </ENAMEX>.
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> scoffs at those stories , as well as the ones connecting him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">mob</ENAMEX> .
     He says he has never even dined with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX> . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">store owner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Aichi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">prefecture</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> started out in the textile business . From there , he set up his finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real estate to building golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">courses</ENAMEX> .
     He spends <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">most weekends</TIMEX> flying his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">helicopter</ENAMEX> to one of his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">courses</ENAMEX> , he says , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which were designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicklaus</ENAMEX> .
     He also owns <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:ATTRACTION">courses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     The gruff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> recently started socializing in upper-class circles .
     Although he says he was n't keen on going , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> he attended a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> gala where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> made her debut .
     He also leads an opulent life style . Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Denenchofu</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> 's richest neighborhoods , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> 's splashy brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">manor</ENAMEX> -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> he owns -- outshines the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> ' .
     A lavish white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">portico</ENAMEX> with a stained-glass window towers over the brick wall surrounding his property . Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> says little about his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> , he offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> rule to success : Never gamble too far . `` I quit after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> try , whether I win or lose , '' he says . `` I 'm done in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morishita</ENAMEX> says he intends to expand his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> to many other areas at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> and abroad . He 'll be there wherever there 's money to be made , laughs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kori </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> .
     `` Who knows , '' he says , `` if he heard that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> make money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> , he might be flying out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> disclosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> that it had taken a huge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> provision for loan losses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , the result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> 's worsening real-estate market .

     Private-sector union contracts signed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , but wage increases still are running above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's levels .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> said wage settlements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> called for average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> wage increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.0 %</NUMEX> over the life of the contracts .
     The last time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to these settlements negotiated wage increases , mostly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , wages increased an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> a year over the life of the contracts . If this pattern continues , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> said , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> that the measure has shown an increase since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> started comparing expiring contracts with those that replaced them .
     This reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> who work in health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     Settlements reached in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of 1989</TIMEX> called for wage increases averaging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.7 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the first contract year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> over the life of the contracts , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> said . For all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , union contracts provided for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> wage increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 %</NUMEX> over the life of the contracts . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the second quarter</TIMEX> , contracts called for increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4 %</NUMEX> over the life of the contracts .
     The figures exclude lump-sum payments and cost-of-living adjustments , so the actual wage increases may have been bigger .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 35 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> covered by contracts signed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of year</TIMEX> get lump-sum payments ; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> are covered by cost-of-living clauses .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">Unions</ENAMEX> covered by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Labor Department</ENAMEX> said wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> under major collective bargaining agreements , regardless of when they were signed , wage increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of 1989</TIMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> -- including cost-of-living adjustments .

     An enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> has succeeded where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has failed : He has made speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> respectable . The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">6 1\/2-foot-tall</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pong Pagong</ENAMEX> , is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">character</ENAMEX> who stars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 's television show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> . '' He speaks only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> , '' which started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1983</TIMEX> as a hybrid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> program `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> , '' has developed into a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> effort .
     Radio programs and books have followed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> television show . In the process , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> , '' an archaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has become a powerful advocate of the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> language . `` It impresses on ordinary , young <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Filipinos</ENAMEX> that there 's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy David</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> and host of a popular television talk show .
     `` When we started the program <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six years ago</TIMEX> , the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia Brown</ENAMEX> , the program 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> .
     Now , she says , `` it 's no longer an issue . ''
     The success of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> as a national language . <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> -- once known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Pilipino</ENAMEX> -- is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tagalog</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>-based language spoken in a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's principal island of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Luzon </ENAMEX>.
     Resistance to a national language comes primarily from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> , who generally prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
     But while better-off <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Filipinos</ENAMEX> are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> , say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of the native language . `` For the middle and upper-middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> -RCB- is declasse , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bien Lumbera</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX>-studies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Quezon City</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of the Philippines</ENAMEX> .
     There 's also resentment .
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> come from non-<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tagalog</ENAMEX> regions .
     They argue that their own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> understands <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> more than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> .

     What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> .
     It is entrenched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's colonial bonds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> class structure , in the regional loyalties of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and in its island geography . As they did when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">colony</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> for the most part teach in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , even though it is a foreign language for most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> . As a result , they often speak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language at home , another at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> a `` language <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> . ''
     The issue has been simmering for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> .
     It does n't take much to provoke an intense debate . When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corazon Aquino</ENAMEX> , whose command of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> is spotty , announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> that the language would be used in official communications , there was an uproar from many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> , who continue to conduct debates mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> . But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> see resistance to the language finally crumbling .
     They believe the media , including `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> , '' have played a crucial role . According to chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scriptwriter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Villanueva</ENAMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' does n't set out to advance the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it . '' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">These days</TIMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' is produced in a converted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">lumberyard</ENAMEX> on a shoestring budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,000</NUMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> segment .
     It is shown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekdays</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> . With an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400,000</NUMEX> , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' consistently ranks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's top-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> most-watched <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> programs . But advertising revenue is inadequate . Periodically , there are threats that the program will fold . `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> '' lacks the polish of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> . '' Sound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">stages</ENAMEX> echo .
     Acting sometimes falls flat .
     There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> large puppets in the program : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pong Pagong</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kiko Matsing</ENAMEX> . But the production is the equal of any local program . And the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies .
     The program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> and the environment .
     Not that the language war is won , even on `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Batibot</ENAMEX> . '' During <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recent episode , all the advertisements were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .

     The move significantly expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Black &amp; Decker</ENAMEX> 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load .

     It 's a nuisance tax on mergers .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has decided to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 million</NUMEX> by charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> for the honor of filing the required papers under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart-Scott-Rodino</ENAMEX> law .
     Ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the bad days</TIMEX> of Big is Bad antitrust enforcement , this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart-Scott</ENAMEX> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met . Typically , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hart-Scott</ENAMEX> is used now to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target firms</ENAMEX> early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic . The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20,000</NUMEX> tax would be a small cost in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX> deal , but a serious drag on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of small , friendly deals .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">division</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> .

     At a news conference , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">juice</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> said that as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said he will be urging his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">allies</ENAMEX> to boost their stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> , which is being traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> and is to resume trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     At the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's bid .
     For the moment , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said , he has decided against seeking a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knight</ENAMEX> or organizing a counterbid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> unconsolidated , or parent-company , profit is likely to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.7 billion francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 754.4 million</NUMEX> -RRB- , up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">633.8 million francs</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     That is due mostly to payments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> for most of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> stake it has agreed to acquire in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> 's insurance business .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> said the exceptional gain would mean nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice as high</NUMEX> a dividend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> as last .
     If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> avoid tendering to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> , he added , they can expect strong dividends again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> noted that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past 20 years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> has built his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> through astute stock-market activity and has warded off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> takeover attempts .
     This time , however , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think he could face a real battle . `` Without some unexpected `` coup de theatre '' , I do n't see what will block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> bid , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe de Cholet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brokerage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cholet-Dupont &amp; Cie</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Cholet</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier </ENAMEX>'s biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to block the bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> still needs the go-ahead from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commission des Operations de Bourse </ENAMEX>, a government regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">agency</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said that is considered likely .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> also noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's core of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> was denationalized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , and said it now holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just under 5 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's shares .
     Once he realized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> stake above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     The petition is still pending , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big question now is the likely role of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> said the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> that hold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> 's capital all strongly support him , but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said they are n't so sure .

     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tax Reform Act</ENAMEX> has nearly eliminated the number of large , profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> that do n't pay federal income tax , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Citizens for Tax Justice</ENAMEX> , a nonprofit , labor-funded research and lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> .
     In a study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's richest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> managed to avoid paying federal income taxes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> the old tax rules were in effect , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , when some of the new tax provisions went into effect .
     Moreover , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that paid no federal income tax from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> -- despite <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> of profits -- ended up paying an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.9 %</NUMEX> of their income in federal taxes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     The report , released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , comes as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is considering a number of special tax breaks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only three years</TIMEX> after the sweeping tax-revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes .
     In the corporate realm , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> law abolished the investment-tax credit , scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax , a levy to ensure all money-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> pay some federal tax .
     The combination of lower rates and fewer loopholes has meant that the so-called average effective tax rate -- the rate actually paid -- of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> surveyed reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.3 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the years from 1981</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , according to the study .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> are now shouldering a bigger share of the tax burden , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> law hoped .
     Corporate taxes paid for almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> of federal spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> -- excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> -- compared with less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half of the 1980s</TIMEX> , the study found .
     `` Tax reform is working , '' the study said .
     `` Under the new tax-reform law , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">days</TIMEX> of widespread , wholesale corporate tax avoidance have come to an end . ''
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kroger Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pinnacle West Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">CSX Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Illinois Power Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Media General Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gulf States Utilities Co.</ENAMEX> , did n't pay any federal income tax last year although they garnered a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> in profits , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> said .
     In fact , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> received refunds , which totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 120 million</NUMEX> .
     The lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> used publicly available information to calculate each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments .
     This is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fifth year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Citizens for Tax Justice</ENAMEX> has released a study on corporate tax bills .
     Earlier reports , which revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> were avoiding income tax legally , have been credited with helping galvanize efforts to overhaul the tax code . But even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are paying more taxes , many are still paying less than the statutory rate , the report said .
     And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> paid effective tax rates of below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of their income .
     `` While the overall picture is very encouraging , significant corporate tax avoidance continues , '' the study said .

     In search of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> for upscale department-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chains</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> are turning to -- who else ? The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> . But so far <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's cash-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> are proving to be cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shoppers</ENAMEX> . `` We have the money to buy .
     But operating a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> department-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">chain</ENAMEX> would be very difficult , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motoyuki Homma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing director</ENAMEX> of the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsukoshi Ltd.</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's leading department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> say the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have watched the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> stumble in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">home</ENAMEX> wo n't translate into success in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> are also wary of attracting negative publicity .
     After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> 's recent headline-grabbing acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> , many say it makes good political sense to lie low .
     `` It 's a question of timing , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayumi Takayama</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Isetan Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> .
     Still , for those with a long-term eye on the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retail market , this is a tempting time to look for bargains .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> is trying to unwind its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> , which include such well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Marshall Field 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Breuners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ivey 's</ENAMEX> .
     And debt-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau Corp. of Toronto</ENAMEX> is giving up the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     `` Every department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is taking a look , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Allen</ENAMEX> , a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barclay 's de Zoete Wedd Securities -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen </ENAMEX>, however , does n't think that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> is about to embark on a major buying binge .
     Nonetheless , speculation heated up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu Department Store Co.</ENAMEX> confirmed a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's leading business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">daily</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu</ENAMEX> is talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> about buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tokyu</ENAMEX> , however , said no agreement had been reached .

     What Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> is hoping to put together , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say , is a management-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> department-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> that he heads from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau 's Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated</ENAMEX> ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau </ENAMEX>, which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction .
     Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Federated</ENAMEX> decided to sell off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">jewels</ENAMEX> of its retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bloomingdale 's</ENAMEX> .
     Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> to help him find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> for a management-led buy-out .
     Ideally , investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> say , he wants to get backing from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">store</ENAMEX> to forge a global retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> .
     `` When you look at the economics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> needs a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> to make it work , '' says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> who follows the retail industry .
     `` Looking only at a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> strategy is n't where it 's at . ''
     Persuading tradition-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">retailers</ENAMEX> to get involved in the turmoils of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing industry is n't likely to be so easy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say . Up until now , most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> have followed the same basic overseas strategy :
     <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> they set up overseas merchandising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> to import items and track new fashion trends .
     Then they opened small gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> mostly aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> .
     Reluctant to advance further on their own , some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> have settled for tie-ups with famous specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last March</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Isetan</ENAMEX> invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.6 million</NUMEX> -RRB- in a venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Barney 's Inc.</ENAMEX> , an up-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clothier</ENAMEX> .

     Through the longstanding relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> has opened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">shops</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">arcades</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .

     Some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> 's classy image makes it a possible match for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> .

     Some lousy earnings reports whacked the stock market , but bond prices fell only slightly and the dollar rose a little against most major currencies .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39.55</NUMEX> points , to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2613.73</NUMEX> , in active trading .
     Long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ended slightly higher .
     The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen , but soared against the pound following the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor of the Exchequer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> have complained that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> corporate earnings have n't been very good , but the effect hit home particularly hard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .

     The less-than-robust <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading .
     Taken together , the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks . The number of stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> that fell in price <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> , a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> said the economy grew an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , in line with expectations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are increasingly predicting much more sluggish growth -- and therefore more corporate earnings disappointments -- for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> .
     `` There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Joseph Cohen </ENAMEX>, a market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market . ''
     The bond market was unmoved by the economic statistics .
     While bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> would have preferred growth to be a little slower , they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9 %</NUMEX> .
     That is another small encouragement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming weeks</TIMEX> , they reasoned .

     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">249</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166</NUMEX> roll call came as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">chamber</ENAMEX> approved a compromise bill allocating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.2 billion</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">State</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1990</TIMEX> and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's vote on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese-American</ENAMEX> reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision , which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> authorized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .

     `` Read my lips , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith </ENAMEX>.
     `` If you 're for paying the claims ... I do n't know how anyone can oppose this . ''
     No payments would be made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , but beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fiscal 1991</TIMEX> , the bill commits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> payments of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 500 million</NUMEX> until the total liability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25 billion</NUMEX> is met .
     The issue has assumed some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">As much as</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> led the opposition , among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> came from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Old Dixiecrat South</ENAMEX> and its borders .
     The odd mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">departments</ENAMEX> in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annual</TIMEX> appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Legal Services Corp</ENAMEX> .
     The measure provides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 321 million</NUMEX> to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> are agreed to by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .

     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 17.2 billion</NUMEX> total for the bill does n't include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> in supplemental anti-drug funds approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> competing for assistance .

     Few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> themselves -- including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gramm-Rudman-Hollings</ENAMEX> deficit-reduction law .
     When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> conference on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's bill rescinded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.8 million</NUMEX> in unexpended funds for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , economic development project backed by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> -RRB- insisted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> that the money be preserved .
     The measure includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</NUMEX> secured by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudman</ENAMEX> for a marine-research project at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hollings</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">S.C .</ENAMEX> -RRB- used his power to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 million</NUMEX> for an advanced technology initiative in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> .

     The Big Three <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> posted losses in their core <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth period</TIMEX> .
     The strongest sign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> 's woes came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> , which said it had a loss in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> automotive business for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> net income will fall below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year-earlier</TIMEX> level , partly because of a likely <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500 million</NUMEX> charge from the sale of its steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     The bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some non-automotive operations .
     Still , the combined profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.83 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> , excluding a one-time gain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 309 million</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> stock .
     The last time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> automotive losses was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the recession year</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> 's announcements helped spark a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> wave of program selling in the stock market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's common closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 44.375</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> to end at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 47.50</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> eased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22.25</NUMEX> , all in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     The market 's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX> .
     As <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> gained market share , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> in the lead , slashed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> production and launched a retail discounting blitz .
     The price war peaked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> discounts climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1,000</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> , according to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> probably had the `` heaviest incentives , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S. Miller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> .
     `` We all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them . ''
     But the costly efforts did little to slow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> market gains , and domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> sales have plunged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 %</NUMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Big Three</ENAMEX> ended many of their programs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> have already cut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> output plans an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> levels . If sales do n't pick up , the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> , which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn , saw earnings take a beating .
     The No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> market -- for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> drop in net to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 477.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.03</NUMEX> a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.24 billion</NUMEX> . Nearly all the decline came in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> automotive operations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dearborn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> ran a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37 million</NUMEX> on assembling and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , a deterioration of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 378 million</NUMEX> in that line from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> managed to show a profit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year earlier</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> reported record net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 856.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.78</NUMEX> a share , on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20.38 billion</NUMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest nine months</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.52 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.51</NUMEX> a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.14 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.53</NUMEX> a share .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that had reeled off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12 consecutive quarters</TIMEX> of improved earnings until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1989 second quarter</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David N. McCammon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , finance , insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results `` better in this downturn than in prior downturns , '' when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> had net losses .
     Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCammon</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy to weaken through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1990</TIMEX> , causing weaker sales and production .
     As a result , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> profit will come in below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> results , although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> decline , he said .
     Part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 500 million</NUMEX> from the proposed sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rouge Steel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 fourth quarter</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> had net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.16 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.42</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> 's operating profit fell to a scant <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 22 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> a share , its lowest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> total in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven years</TIMEX> .
     Its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 309 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.32</NUMEX> a share , gain from the sale of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> shares made net <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 331 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.42</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales were flat at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.88 billion</NUMEX> .
     The results include record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 76 million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler Financial Corp</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year earlier</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> 's net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 113 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> a share .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said costs of incentives caused a `` moderate '' loss in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Highland Park</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mich.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> .
     He said the loss was n't `` that much different '' from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 37 million</NUMEX> loss on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> automotive operations , but he declined to be specific .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> spent an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> on its incentive programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 450</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> -- a `` high-water mark '' at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">time</TIMEX> .
     He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> `` is no longer sure '' of its forecast for industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">car</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">truck</ENAMEX> sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.2 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1990 model year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> , he said , are balking at higher prices on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> , especially after seeing the incentive-reduced prices on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">models</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> , net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.38</NUMEX> a share , including the gain from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> stock sale , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 617 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.77</NUMEX> a share , after a charge of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42 cents</NUMEX> a share , for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> closings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 period</TIMEX> .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 27.95 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25.78 billion</NUMEX> .
     Heavy losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's net tumbling to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 516.9 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record $ 859.2 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Detroit</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> does n't issue separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> earnings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> automotive business .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> had a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $ 300 million</NUMEX> on domestic vehicle operations .
     An <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.5 %</NUMEX> drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factory</ENAMEX> sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">trucks</ENAMEX> cut into revenue , and rebates to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> more than offset gains from price increases on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1990</TIMEX> model vehicles delivered during the period , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said . But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> breakdown , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> attributed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of its net to its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM Hughes Electronics Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> said overseas auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> are on track to exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full-year</TIMEX> net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.7 billion</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">diversified operations</ENAMEX> helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> build its cash reserves , exclusive of its financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.5 billion</NUMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> increase from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     This cushion could come in handy if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> has to trim <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> production schedules more than the already scheduled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.5 %</NUMEX> . Under the circumstances , it wo n't be easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> to exceed its record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988 fourth-quarter</TIMEX> net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 billion</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> acknowledged .
     That means it 's unlikely the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> will surpass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.9 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">full-year</TIMEX> profit , even though net for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX> was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.52 billion</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 95.57 billion</NUMEX> .
     It earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.46 billion</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 91.21 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1988 nine months</TIMEX> .

     There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> versions of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Measure for Measure</ENAMEX> '' on stage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alley Theater</ENAMEX> here .
     One is a strong , vigorous portrayal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> 's play ; the other is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Boyd</ENAMEX> 's overlay of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">present-day</TIMEX> punk rock decadence on old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vienna</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Measure for Measure</ENAMEX> '' is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> 's `` problem '' plays , so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy , comedy or history .
     Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why it is very much in vogue with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> just now .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last season</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Hartford Stage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Lamos</ENAMEX> mounted a production at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX> , and currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other productions -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> just closed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Old Globe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Diego</ENAMEX> and another now at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Seattle Rep</ENAMEX> -- overlap with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd </ENAMEX>'s .
     In the play , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vienna</ENAMEX> despairs over the licentiousness of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and turns over the rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> to the puritanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo </ENAMEX>, hoping he can set things right .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> hears that the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> has made his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiancee</ENAMEX> pregnant before he could marry her , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> summarily condemns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> to death .
     When , however , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novitiate</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">convent</ENAMEX> , goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> to plead her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> 's case , the obdurate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> immediately falls in love with her and , in a supreme act of hypocrisy , demands that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> 's life .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke </ENAMEX>, who set the original scheme in motion , appears on the scene disguised as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friar</ENAMEX> and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> arranges a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last minute</TIMEX> reprieve for all concerned .
     For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alley</ENAMEX> production , scene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter David Gould</ENAMEX> has arranged a stark but extremely effective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">set</ENAMEX> featuring a rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">platform</ENAMEX> of white-washed boards that extends into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> .
     When the action requires , a prison <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cell</ENAMEX> , consisting of an enlarged wire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cage</ENAMEX> , rolls forward on iron wheels on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">platform</ENAMEX> .
     In the play 's major scenes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Lauren</ENAMEX> -RRB- confronts her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Loney</ENAMEX> -RRB- in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">cell</ENAMEX> , explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom ; when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> and the disguised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Kerr</ENAMEX> -RRB- conspire to trick <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> ; and when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariana </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annalee Jefferies</ENAMEX> -RRB- , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> wronged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo </ENAMEX>, confronts him with his past misdeeds , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence .
     At such <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> .
     When , however , he decides to be modern , or more accurately , when he decides to be trendy , the results are far less satisfactory .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> accessible to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> .
     It 's a valid approach , but it puts a heavy burden on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste .
     In his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Measure</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> has `` modernized '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Vienna</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> is supposed to bring under control by converting them into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transvestites</ENAMEX> , punk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rockers</ENAMEX> and heavy metal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> , with a strong emphasis on leather , chains and porno-inspired costumes .
     Loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes , even those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">convent</ENAMEX> .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> is arrested , he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles .
     When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opportunist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucio </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Stehlin</ENAMEX> -RRB- visits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:RELIGIOUS">convent</ENAMEX> to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> 's fate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucio</ENAMEX> not only slaps the mother <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior</ENAMEX> on her rear , but brings along a voluptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jill Powell</ENAMEX> -RRB- , not in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> 's script , to undulate lasciviously .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pompey </ENAMEX>-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen Allen Pruett</ENAMEX> -RRB- , dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece , indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe .
     The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination .
     The inclusion at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point , for example , of a list of glitzy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">modern-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">malefactors</ENAMEX> , ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bakker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Zsa Gabor</ENAMEX> , is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd </ENAMEX>'s ability .
     Despite the excesses , however , the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses .
     What 's more , it represents an important step for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alley Theater</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Measure for Measure</ENAMEX> '' is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd </ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> directorial assignment as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">theater</ENAMEX> 's new artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .
     He succeeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Brown</ENAMEX> , who was fired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">18 months ago</TIMEX> .
     Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">establishment</ENAMEX> and led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Zeisler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Theatre Communications Group</ENAMEX> , to write an editorial in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Theatre magazine</ENAMEX> condemning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> .
     None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> 's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative . Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alley</ENAMEX> has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts .
     Not only is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">theater</ENAMEX> a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage , the balance sheet is the best the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">theater</ENAMEX> has had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">10 years</TIMEX> .
     As opposed to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.4 million</NUMEX> deficit of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987-88 season</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988-89 year</TIMEX> concluded with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200,000</NUMEX> surplus and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 500,000</NUMEX> cash reserve .
     Admittedly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last season</TIMEX> 's runaway hit , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:PLAY">Steel Magnolias</ENAMEX> , '' helped a lot , but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">board</ENAMEX> .
     Only time will tell if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> can restore to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Alley</ENAMEX> the acclaim it received when its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Vance</ENAMEX> , was at the height of her powers .
     But it is clear he is going to give it a shot .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have bottled up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's capital-gains tax cut in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">D.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Maine</ENAMEX> -RRB- said he intends to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> procedures to force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of the tax cut to come up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 60</NUMEX> votes before they can address the issue .
     And neither <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> are predicting that the capital-gains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> can produce enough votes . `` The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-vote requirement will be there and they do n't have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> votes , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> said .
     `` They do n't have the votes to get it passed . '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ore.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of the tax cut , did n't disagree . `` I 'm not sure what 's going to happen , '' he said . Previously he had said he would be able to find the requisite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> votes eventually .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill , now pending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> , that would authorize aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Hungary</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster , or extended debate . For a cloture vote to stop the filibuster , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> must muster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 60</NUMEX> votes .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> acknowledged , `` We do n't have the votes for cloture <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> show no sign of relenting .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:POLITICAL">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> aid measure . And they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> with the capital-gains provision .
     `` This is serious business ; we 're serious about a capital-gains reduction , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> . `` The strategy is ` Let 's vote . ' ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> contend that they can garner a majority in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> for a capital-gains tax cut .
     They accuse the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> of unfairly using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> rules to erect a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-vote hurdle .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> counter that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> have often used the same rules to suit their own ends .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:POLITICAL">sides</ENAMEX> also traded accusations about the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> asserted that the proposal , which also would create a new type of individual retirement account , was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in the long run .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> countered that long-range revenue estimates were unreliable .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
     It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is `` generally supportive '' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan .
