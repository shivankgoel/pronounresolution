     In an age of specialization , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">judiciary</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the last bastions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalist</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> must jump from murder to antitrust cases , from arson to securities fraud , without missing a beat .
     But even on the federal bench , specialization is creeping in , and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> to serve , among other things , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> of last resort for most patent disputes .
     Previously , patent cases moved through the court system to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> circuit appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> .
     There , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable .
     A new specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> was sought by patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> , who believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalists</ENAMEX> had botched too many important , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> cases .
     Some patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> had hoped that such a specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> would be filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the field .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> thought otherwise , and so may the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> .
     Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1984</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has filled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> vacancies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Circuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> with non-patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Now</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline Newman</ENAMEX> , Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard T. Markey</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">68</TIMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles Rich</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">85</TIMEX> -- have patent-law backgrounds .
     The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel M. Friedman</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> , are approaching senior status or retirement .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> seats currently are vacant and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others are likely to be filled within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a few years</TIMEX> , so patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and research-based industries are making a new push for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> to be added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">organizations</ENAMEX> , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Industrial Biotechnical Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> , have asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> to name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> with both patent and scientific backgrounds .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">associations</ENAMEX> would like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between three and six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> with specialized training .
     Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">associations</ENAMEX> have recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D. Lourie</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">54</TIMEX> , a former patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">SmithKline Beckman Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lourie</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> interviewed him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last July</TIMEX> .
     Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> .
     `` We do not feel that seats are reserved -LRB- for patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> -RRB- , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Runkel</ENAMEX> , who declines to say how soon a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> will be named .
     `` But we will take it into consideration . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> 's view is shared by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Robert Mayer</ENAMEX> , a former civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigator</ENAMEX> who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Circuit</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     `` I believe that any good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> should be able to figure out and understand patent law , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> says , adding that `` it 's the responsibility of highly paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> -LRB- who argue before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> -RRB- to make us understand -LRB- complex patent litigation -RRB- . ''
     Yet some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Medtronic , Inc.</ENAMEX> , the patent infringement case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> agreed to review , as an example of poor legal reasoning by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who lack patent litigation experience .
     -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> was not on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> . -RRB-
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> case , the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> broadly construed a federal statute to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Medtronic</ENAMEX> , a medical device <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> , an exemption to infringe a patent under certain circumstances .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> holds in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Medtronic</ENAMEX> 's favor , the decision will have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion-dollar</NUMEX> consequences for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of medical devices , color and food <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">additives</ENAMEX> and all other non-drug products that required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food &amp; Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Raines</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of government relations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Industrial Biotechnical Association</ENAMEX> , contends that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman</ENAMEX> , a former patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> , wrote in her dissent when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> 's judicial legislation has affected an important high-technological industry , without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest . ''
     Says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raines</ENAMEX> , `` -LRB- The judgment -RRB- confirms our concern that the absence of patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> could prove troublesome .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder , Peabody &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> is trying to struggle back .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only a few months ago</TIMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">124-year-old</TIMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown , racked by internal squabbles and defections .
     Its relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> had been frayed since a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> insider-trading scandal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> .
     Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> had come and gone .
     Now , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> says it 's at a turning point .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this year</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">63-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silas Cathcart</ENAMEX> -- the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Illinois Tool Works</ENAMEX> who was derided as a `` tool-and-die <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> '' when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> brought him in to clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> -- retires to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lake Forest</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ill.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">home</ENAMEX> , possibly to build a shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">mall</ENAMEX> on some land he owns .
     `` I 've done what I came to do '' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> , he says .
     And that means <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">42-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , will for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time take complete control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> and try to make good on some grandiose plans .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> says he will return <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> to prominence as a great investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> .
     Wall Street is understandably skeptical .
     Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first nine months of the year</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> ranks a distant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10th</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks and bonds , with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 %</NUMEX> market share , up slightly from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year-earlier</TIMEX> period , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Securities Data Co .</ENAMEX>
     It 's quite a fall from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> still was counted as an investment-banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">powerhouse</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary S. Goldstein</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Whitney Group</ENAMEX> , an executive search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , said : `` I 'd like to see -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> -RRB- succeed .
     But they have to attract good senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> who can bring in the business from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day one</TIMEX> . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> eked out a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 46 million</NUMEX> profit , mainly because of severe cost cutting .
     Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX>-member brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> reported <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 5 million</NUMEX> loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> expects it to turn a profit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     In fact , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">player</ENAMEX> in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading ; in that controversial business , only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> .
     But even that niche is under attack , as several Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> pulled back from program trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> under pressure from big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> , a former consulting-firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who has a love for `` task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> , '' says he has done a `` complete rethink '' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent months</TIMEX> .
     There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's operations .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 20</NUMEX> new managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice presidents</ENAMEX> have been hired since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> has been trimmed and its mergers-and-acquisitions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> increased to a record <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> says that when he assumes full control , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> will finally tap the resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's goals when it bought <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> was to take advantage of `` syngeries '' between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Electric Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> 's corporate-finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , which has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 42 billion</NUMEX> in assets .
     The leveraged buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> now reports to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> .
     So far , instead of teaming up , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> have bickered .
     Yet , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> , `` We 've really started to exploit the synergy between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> have worked on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> investment banking deals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , he says , though not all of them have panned out .
     `` We 've had a good relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GE</ENAMEX> , which is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time you could say that -- uh , let me withdraw that .
     It 's been a steadily improving relationship , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> .
     Still , without many actual deals to show off , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is left to stress that it finally has `` a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> '' in place , and that everyone works harder .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A month ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> started serving dinner at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 7:30 each night</TIMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50 to 60</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operation</ENAMEX> have consistently been around that late .
     `` We are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott C. Newquist</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of investment banking since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">June</TIMEX> .
     Everywhere , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> stresses the `` always working '' theme .
     A new in-house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">magazine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder World</ENAMEX> -- which will focus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's synergy strategy , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> -- confides that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekends</TIMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newquist</ENAMEX> `` often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Cessna Centurion</ENAMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Nantucket</ENAMEX> . ''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newquist</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.J. Megargel</ENAMEX> , talks of the opportunity to `` rebuild a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">franchise</ENAMEX> '' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> .
     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> name is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> recognizes as a viable alternative '' when considering a merger deal , he says .
     Now , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder World</ENAMEX> story about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Megargel</ENAMEX> , all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> has to do is `` position ourselves more in the deal flow . ''
     With investment banking as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's `` lead business , '' where do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>-branch brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> fit in ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this month</TIMEX> sold off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> , refueling speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is getting out of the brokerage business entirely .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> denies the speculation .
     To answer the brokerage question , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> , in typical fashion , completed a task-force study .
     The result : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> will focus on rich individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , much closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX> than a serve-the-world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> notes that these types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> also are `` sophisticated '' enough not to complain about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's aggressive use of program trading .
     As part of the upscale push , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> through a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20-week</TIMEX> training course , turning them into `` investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> '' with knowledge of corporate finance .
     They will get `` new and improved tools to sell , particularly to the affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> , '' says brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V. Sheehan</ENAMEX> .
     Theoretically , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> will then be able to funnel `` leads '' on corporate finance opportunities to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> , possibly easing the longstanding tension between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> caution that this kind of cross-pollination between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> looks great on paper , but does n't always happen .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> are n't outwardly hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> , as many are to a tough <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> that does n't have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's long history .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's hiring binge involving executive-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> , some with multiple-year contract guarantees , could backfire unless there are results .
     The departing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says he has no worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> 's future .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> , who will return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Quaker Oats Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> , in addition to his personal ventures , is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> .
     He also improved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's compliance procedures for trading .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says he has had `` a lot of fun '' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> , adding the crack about his being a `` tool-and-die <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> '' never bothered him .
     `` It was an absolutely marvelous line and one I used many times , '' he says .
     Smiling broadly when he talks about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> is `` going to be recognized shortly as one of the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the investment-banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">business</ENAMEX> . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is `` gon na hum . ''
     Or , as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> , again drawing on his consulting-firm background , puts it : `` We 're ready to implement at this point .

     In what could prove a major addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> ' foreign-investment portfolio , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> signed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 180 million</NUMEX> construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USI Far East Corp.</ENAMEX> , a petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , initialed the agreement with an unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">naphtha</ENAMEX> cracker , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alson Lee</ENAMEX> , who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> set up to build and operate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Luzon Petrochemical Corp.</ENAMEX> , said the contract was signed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USI Far East</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> .
     Contract details , however , have n't been made public .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> is to be located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Batangas</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about 70 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">USI Far East</ENAMEX> will hold a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Luzon Petrochemical</ENAMEX> , according to papers signed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Board of Investments</ENAMEX> .
     The proposed petrochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> would use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">naphtha</ENAMEX> to manufacture the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">petrochemicals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">propylene</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">ethylene</ENAMEX> and their resin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">derivatives</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polypropylene</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> .
     These are the raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">materials</ENAMEX> used in making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">plastics</ENAMEX> .
     The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project .
     At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 360 million</NUMEX> , the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corazon Aquino</ENAMEX> took office in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">February 1986</TIMEX> .
     It also is considered critical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's efforts to both attract other investment from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and raise heavy industry capabilities .
     The project has been in and out of the pipeline for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than a decade</TIMEX> .
     However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> ca n't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">complex</ENAMEX> are resolved , moves which caused the signing to remain questionable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">up to the last moment</TIMEX> .
     As previously reported , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> has sued to stop the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enrique Garcia</ENAMEX> , had actively backed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , but at the original site in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:OTHER">constituency</ENAMEX> northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> dismissed the suit , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last month</TIMEX> filed for a reconsideration .
     In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</NUMEX> tax on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">naphtha</ENAMEX> , the principal raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">material</ENAMEX> to be used in the cracker .
     However , at a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> backed the project and said her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> was attempting to soothe the feelings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at the original site , adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's major petroleum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Bataan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> .
     `` We have tried our best to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Bataan</ENAMEX> that maybe this time it will not go to them , but certainly we will do our best to encourage other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> to go to their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">province</ENAMEX> , '' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manila</ENAMEX>-based foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX> .
     The project appeared to be on the rocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> when the other major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> in the project , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">China General Plastics Corp.</ENAMEX> , backed out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">China General Plastics</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">petrochemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> , was to have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Luzon Petrochemical</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs .
     He wants it now .
     Not so fast , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Edwards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> .
     `` I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> , '' he says .
     It 's the line-item veto , a procedure that would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> without vetoing the entire bill .
     Whatever one thinks of the idea , it 's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance .
     Rather , it 's a device that could send shock waves through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's entire relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> alike in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> does its business .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesmen</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is considering simply declaring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> gives him the power , exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right .
     Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> , it would set off a political earthquake .
     `` The ramifications are enormous , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> who is a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> know it 's a step that ca n't be taken lightly -- and for that reason , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> may back down from launching a test case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Some senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> already has enough pending confrontations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     They prefer to put off the line-item veto until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">at least next year</TIMEX> .
     Still , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto .
     The issue arose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> told an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was looking for a test case .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Press Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> confirmed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was interested in the idea , but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> and a host of conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process .
     They maintain that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills .
     Those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> operating .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservatives</ENAMEX> note that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> have the line-item veto to use on state budgets .
     More provocatively , some conservative legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> have begun arguing that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> .
     They base their argument on a clause buried in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution</ENAMEX> that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . ''
     This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Kan.</ENAMEX> -RRB- , for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , accepts this argument and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> publicly urged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> `` to use the line-item veto and allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> to decide whether or not it is constitutional . ''
     There 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> -- and that it would quickly make its way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to be ultimately resolved .
     `` It 's a major issue , and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Glazier</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> already has a line-item veto .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> , is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">courts</ENAMEX> , arguing a line-item veto would expand a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> 's powers far beyond anything the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> had in mind .
     `` It puts this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in the legislative business , '' he declares .
     `` That 's not what our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> had in mind . ''
     In addition to giving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> to blackmail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> .
     He notes that , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmaker</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area , he fights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">each year</TIMEX> to preserve federal funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">system</ENAMEX> .
     If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">BART</ENAMEX> funds unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> maintain that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that .
     But there may be another problem with the device : Despite all the political angst it would cause , it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit .
     Big chunks of the government budget , like the entitlement programs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Medicare</ENAMEX> , would n't be affected .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governors</ENAMEX> have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity .
     And it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves .
     Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> contend that the veto would have what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazier</ENAMEX> calls an important `` chilling effect '' on all manner of appropriations bills .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> , they say , would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later .
     Whatever the outcome of a test case , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would `` antagonize not just <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Fisher</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congressional Research Service</ENAMEX> who specializes in executive-legislative relations .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republicans</ENAMEX> have as much interest as <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> in `` the way the system works , '' he notes .
     Indeed , although a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> favor a line-item veto , some , ranging from liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hatfield</ENAMEX> to conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> are opposed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Conservatives</ENAMEX> pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">conservatives</ENAMEX> .
     `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

     This has n't been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg Co.</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year</TIMEX> .
     The oat-bran craze has cost the world 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cereal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> market share .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> quit suddenly .
     And now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> cereal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> was n't to begin turning out product until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1993</TIMEX> , so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> , which has n't been as successful in capitalizing on the public 's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Mills Inc.</ENAMEX> , has been losing share in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6 billion</NUMEX> ready-to-eat cereal market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg 's</ENAMEX> current share is believed to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">slightly under 40 %</NUMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> ' share is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 27 %</NUMEX> .
     Led by its oat-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheerios</ENAMEX> line , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> has gained an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> share so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , mostly at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> .
     Each share point is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 60 million</NUMEX> in sales .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg 's</ENAMEX> erosion has been in such core brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Corn Flakes</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Rice Krispies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Frosted Flakes</ENAMEX> , which represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one-third</NUMEX> of its sales volume .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> is so anxious to turn around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Corn Flakes</ENAMEX> sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as 99 cents</NUMEX> , trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> say .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Cheerios</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Honey Nut Cheerios</ENAMEX> have eaten away sales normally going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg 's</ENAMEX> corn-based lines simply because they are made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">oats</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Maguire</ENAMEX> .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said he would n't be surprised if , over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next two years</TIMEX> or so , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> ' share increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> or more .

     He said construction would n't resume until market conditions warrant it .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> indicated that it has room to grow without adding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> , including a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Battle Creek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Building 100</ENAMEX> , which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> are operating at capacity .
     A large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Covington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ga.</ENAMEX> , is to come on line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> , who asked not to be named , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Memphis</ENAMEX> project was `` pulled in for a reconsideration of costs , '' an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction .
     Initial cost estimates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which was to have been built in phases , ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion to $ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> .
     A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said it was `` possible , but highly unlikely , '' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> might never be built .
     `` As we regain our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> level where we have been , and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity , we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan , '' he said .
     The new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> was to have been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> 's largest construction project .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had retained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fluor Daniel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fluor Corp.</ENAMEX> as general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Subcontractors</ENAMEX> said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fluor Daniel</ENAMEX> already has reassigned most of its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said .

     Until recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> had been telling its sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and Wall Street that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> it intended to achieve a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> share of market , measured in dollar volume .
     Although he called current market conditions `` highly competitive , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaMothe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , forecast an earnings increase for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the full year</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 480.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.90</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.3 billion</NUMEX> .
     As expected , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> reported lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings .
     Net fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 123.1 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.02</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.18</NUMEX> a share .

     As competition heats up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> 's crowded bank market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior de Espana</ENAMEX> is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> and move into new activities .
     Under the direction of its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Luzon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> is undergoing a tough restructuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say may be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's privatization .
     The state-owned industrial holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Instituto Nacional de Industria</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Spain</ENAMEX> jointly hold a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.94 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> directly owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.4 %</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Factorex</ENAMEX> , a financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , holds <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.42 %</NUMEX> .
     The rest is listed on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are concerned , however , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities .
     Catching up with commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market conditions turn sour .
     If that proves true , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> could be a prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">partner</ENAMEX> -- or even a takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target</ENAMEX> -- for either a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> seeking to increase its market share after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> plans to dismantle financial barriers .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> abroad , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> has a lot to offer a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suitor</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , however , say they are n't interested in a merger .
     Instead , they are working to transform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> into an efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1992</TIMEX> .
     `` I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> should be run , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon</ENAMEX> says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> to provide subsidized credits for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> exports .
     The market for export financing was liberalized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> , however , forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> to face competition .
     At the same time , many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> 's traditional export markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth .
     As a result , the volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> 's export credit portfolio plunged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">824 billion pesatas</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.04 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 31 , 1986</TIMEX> , to its current <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">522 billion pesetas</NUMEX> .
     The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main pillars of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say .
     Until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon</ENAMEX> took the helm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last November</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> was run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon</ENAMEX> has moved swiftly to streamline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
     `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged .
     `` We 've got to move quickly . ''
     In Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">first year</TIMEX> , the bank eliminated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> jobs .
     Now it says it 'll trim another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX> jobs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the next three to four years</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> abroad .
     To strengthen its capital base , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> issued <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 105 million</NUMEX> in subordinated debt , launched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last year</TIMEX> 's drop in export credit was partially offset by a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> surge in lending to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and small and medium-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> has an excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> still has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most profitable markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , which will aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> with the tough tasks it faces ahead .
     Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> says it 's interested in purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Morocco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's retail activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Latin America</ENAMEX> are likely to be cut back .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Exterior</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> to create a brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> before the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> underwent sweeping changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July</TIMEX> .
     The late start may be a handicap for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> continues to open up its market to foreign competition .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon</ENAMEX> contends that the experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> he brought with him from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Banco Bilbao Vizcaya</ENAMEX> , where he was formerly director <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> , will whip the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's capital market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> into shape by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of 1992</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> also says it 'll use its international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">network</ENAMEX> to channel investment from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Zurich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchanges</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> 's general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> hopes to cut the number of outside law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> uses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 700</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two years</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry J.

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> trimmed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> from its approved local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> list , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> says .
     The move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> to do more work in-house , instead of farming it out to law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in-house litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> , all former assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> with extensive trial experience .
     He intends to add to the litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> .
     Among the types of cases the in-house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigators</ENAMEX> handle are disputes involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> doing business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> and product-related actions , including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> is suing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> for damages resulting from an accident .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> has also encouraged his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to work more closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> to help prevent future litigation .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have been working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> to develop more uniform welding procedures -- the way a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">vehicle</ENAMEX> is welded has a lot to do with its durability .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> also monitor suits to identify specific automobile parts that cause the biggest legal problems .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> says law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> with the best chance of retaining or winning business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> will be those providing the highest-quality service at the best cost -- echoing similar directives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">suppliers</ENAMEX> .
     This does n't necessarily mean larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> have an advantage ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> works with a number of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> it regards highly .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> has shaken up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">GM</ENAMEX> 's legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions , including a special-projects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> that has made films on safety and drunk driving .
     FEDERAL <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PROSECUTORS</ENAMEX> are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials .
     That 's a finding of a new study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Syracuse University</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Burnham</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> , says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 %</NUMEX> of federal prosecutions concluded at trial ; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9 %</NUMEX> did .
     The study covered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> -- including those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> -- from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Justice Department</ENAMEX> rejected the implication that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> are currently more willing to plea bargain .
     `` Our felony caseloads have been consistent for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">20 years</TIMEX> , '' with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> of all prosecutions going to trial , a department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said .
     The discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Syracuse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> said they based their conclusions on government statistics .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation for this decline '' in taking cases to trial , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnham</ENAMEX> , `` is that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> being charged with crimes by all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> has substantially increased . ''
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> , the study says , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> surveyed filed charges against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">18 years</TIMEX> and older .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> filed against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> .
     Another finding from the study : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> set significantly different priorities .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IMELDA MARCOS</ENAMEX> asks for dismissal , says she was kidnapped .
     The former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> , asked a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> to dismiss an indictment against her , claiming among other things , that she was abducted from her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">homeland</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> and her late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Philippines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX> , were charged with embezzling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 100 million</NUMEX> from that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real estate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> .
     Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> asked federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Keenan</ENAMEX> to give them access to all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> documents about her alleged abduction .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> , in documents it filed in response , said Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> was making the `` fanciful -- and factually unsupported -- claim that she was kidnapped into this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> '' in order to obtain classified material in the case .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">office</ENAMEX> also said Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> were n't brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> against their will after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> was ousted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> quoted statements from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcoses</ENAMEX> in which they said they were in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> at the invitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> and that they were enjoying the hospitality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> for Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> say that because she was taken to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> against her wishes , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> lacks jurisdiction in the case .
     THE FEDERAL <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">COURT</ENAMEX> of appeals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> ruled that the dismissal of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> indictment against former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Crete</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Koskotas</ENAMEX> should be reconsidered .
     The indictment , which was sealed and apparently forgotten by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , charges Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others with tax fraud and other violations .
     He made numerous trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the early 1980s</TIMEX> , but was n't arrested until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> when he showed up as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> of then-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> at a government function .
     A federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Manhattan</ENAMEX> threw out the indictment , finding that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-year</TIMEX> delay violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> 's constitutional right to a speedy trial .
     The appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> , however , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> did n't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koskotas</ENAMEX> is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Greece</ENAMEX> , where he is charged with embezzling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 250 million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Bank of Crete</ENAMEX> .

     `` We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justin L.
