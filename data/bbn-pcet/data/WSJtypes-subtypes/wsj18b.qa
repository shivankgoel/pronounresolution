     But how much will <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> benefit ?
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">harvest</ENAMEX> arrives in plenty after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's drought-ravaged effort : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> estimates corn output at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">7.45 billion bushels</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last fall</TIMEX> .
     Soybean production swells <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 %</NUMEX> .
     As a result , prices paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> for the commodities , which are used in products as diverse as bubble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">gum</ENAMEX> and chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">feed</ENAMEX> , plummet <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 % to 33 %</NUMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> expect consumer food prices to jump <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> to the highest level since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1980</TIMEX> and up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1 %</NUMEX> rise .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Next year</TIMEX> may see a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point .
     Beef prices , hovering near records since the drought , could drop in earnest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this winter</TIMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranchers</ENAMEX> expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> .
     Lower feed prices may help <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> eat more cheaply , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have to factor in an expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">middleman</ENAMEX> : the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processor</ENAMEX> .
     Food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> probably wo n't cut their prices much , blaming other costs .

     It 's estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> experiences infertility , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1 billion</NUMEX> to fight the problem .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Boston</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:HOSPITAL">Beth Israel Hospital</ENAMEX> , say that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 %</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> births they followed occurred after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> in vitro cycles .
     It adds that births were `` extremely unlikely '' after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> cycle and concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who do n't achieve a pregnancy after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to six</NUMEX> procedures should be advised that success is unlikely .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> continue to try .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus Development Corp.</ENAMEX> reported a surprisingly strong <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</NUMEX> sales gain , buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">1-2-3</ENAMEX> computer spreadsheet .
     The results topped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' expectations and the earnings growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> , prompting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past two years</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , in heavy , national over-the-counter trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> shares rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 32.50</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.25</NUMEX> apiece , capping a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">threemonth</TIMEX> run-up of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> said net rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 23 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54 cents</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 153.9 million</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> , net was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 14.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31 cents</NUMEX> a share , on sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 116.8 million</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the nine months</TIMEX> , net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 38.5 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">92 cents</NUMEX> a share , trailed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year earlier</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.9 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.08</NUMEX> a share .
     Sales rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 406 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 356 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year earlier</TIMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> awaited the launch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">1-2-3 Release 3</ENAMEX> , the upgraded spreadsheet software .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> 's results were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 %</NUMEX> higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' average expectations and compared favorably with the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> earnings rise reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a day earlier</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rival</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Redmond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Wash .</ENAMEX>
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said results were bolstered by upgrades to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Release 3</ENAMEX> by previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and improved profit margins , the result of manufacturing-cost controls .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Sherlund</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> had upgrade revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 22 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , twice what he had expected .
     Also , he estimated unit shipments of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">1-2-3</ENAMEX> in all its forms were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 315,000</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> average .
     Demand for the new version was enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> to raise prices with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">distributors</ENAMEX> and to hold market share against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> that tried to exploit the earlier delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Release 3</ENAMEX> 's launch , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherlund</ENAMEX> added .
     He estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">1-2-3</ENAMEX> outsold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Excel</ENAMEX> spreadsheet by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> , and held a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</NUMEX> or better share of the spreadsheet market .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> heaved a sigh of relief <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , a spot check of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> turned up little , if any , potentially lingering damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> or fabrication equipment .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> and corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> of either hardware or software goods .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX> were all up and running <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , though many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were forced to stay home because of damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roadways</ENAMEX> ; others elected to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> off .
     `` These systems are more rugged than many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would believe , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kurlak</ENAMEX> , who tracks the computer industry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Merrill Lynch Research</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit . ''
     Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , completely idled their operations because of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> 's temblor , which registered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> on the Richter scale .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Personnel</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> inspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> for structural weaknesses , mopping up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">floors</ENAMEX> .
     Still , many were confident that `` in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> , everything should be back to normal , '' according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Semiconductor Industry Association</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cupertino</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> , for instance , said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , which puts out disk drives for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">3090</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of mainframes .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> said that , while `` things are a big mess , '' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 18,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have been called back to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> added that it was being `` cautiously optimistic , '' despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> in the region .
     Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Fremont</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> , to the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> , was believed to be undamaged .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandem Computers Inc.</ENAMEX> also signaled that they should recover quickly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> , with major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Clara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cupertino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Mountain View</ENAMEX> , said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> .
     None sustained `` significant '' damage , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said , adding that `` the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally . ''
     For many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , of course , there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with , some of which have the potential to become quite serious .
     For example , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advanced Micro Devices</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">maker</ENAMEX> is worried about blackouts .
     A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built .
     But , given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business , the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> seemed to be just about shouting hosannas .
     Several factors apparently spared the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> -- a sprawling suburban stretch from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Jose</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> -- from the kind of impact felt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> 's drive north .
     For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> there tend to be newer and , thus , in step with the latest safety codes .
     Also , the soil in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> is solid , unlike the landfill of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Marina District</ENAMEX> , which was hit with fires and vast destruction .
     In addition , some microelectronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's .
     Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> said that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plants</ENAMEX> .
     Like other large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel</ENAMEX> also noted that it has <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">factories</ENAMEX> in several parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> , so that a breakdown at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> location should n't leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> in a total pinch .
     That 's certainly good news for such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Houston</ENAMEX> , which has only a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">four-day</TIMEX> supply of microprocessors from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future .
     Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">makers</ENAMEX> were scrambling to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> recover from the disaster .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment</ENAMEX> has set up disaster-recovery response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Dallas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Colo .</ENAMEX>
     These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> were handling calls both from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area and from computers themselves , which are set to dial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> automatically when trouble arises .
     They then run remotely controlled self-diagnostic programs .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital</ENAMEX> also said it has dispatched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , several other major installations around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Valley</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">center</ENAMEX> of high-tech -- said they , too , fared as well as could be expected .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BUILDING">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ENAMEX> , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> tests and conducts research on nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">weapons</ENAMEX> , had only `` superficial damage , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said .
     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> and space systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">about 40 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were asked to head to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> after it was realized that `` there were no show-stoppers '' in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150-plus</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">buildings</ENAMEX> on its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:2D">one-square-mile</NUMEX> campus .
     Several engineering and research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling , but `` the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape , '' an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> 's most lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sectors</ENAMEX> -- accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.59 billion</NUMEX> in sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missiles</ENAMEX> and space <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is the prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractor</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Trident II</ENAMEX> ballistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">missile</ENAMEX> .
     It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:WEAPON">Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX> .
     Fortunately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Hubble Space Telescope</ENAMEX> -- set to be launched on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">shuttle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">14 billion years ago</TIMEX> from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Florida</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the beginning of October</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Maynard</ENAMEX> offered the world a faster way to break <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> .
     As thanks , the egg industry tried to break him .
     And the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> have done a pretty good job .
     They tried to put Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> out of business by an act of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> .
     Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> to ban Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard </ENAMEX>'s automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> .
     His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Misa Manufacturing Inc.</ENAMEX> , was forced to seek protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">creditors</ENAMEX> under federal bankruptcy law in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and has since been liquidated .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monthly</TIMEX> sales of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King</ENAMEX> machine -- which he now is marketing through a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> -- have sunk to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half a dozen</NUMEX> from a peak of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> , says the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">46-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> is n't the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> to bump up against entrenched interests .
     But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight -- it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> is a threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">republic</ENAMEX> -- and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product .
     Now one might ask why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them .
     Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry .
     Many larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> are also <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">processors</ENAMEX> , who crack , inspect , and sanitize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> , turning them into powdered , liquified or frozen egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">products</ENAMEX> .
     However , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bakers</ENAMEX> , restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs</ENAMEX> and other food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preparers</ENAMEX> who flocked to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> 's defense say that products ranging from egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">bread</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eclairs</ENAMEX> lose some zip when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> come in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">30-pound</NUMEX> cans instead of shells .
     But for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> a day , breaking them by hand can get , well , out of hand .
     The idea behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King</ENAMEX> is pretty simple : put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets , spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King</ENAMEX> -- which at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">just under four feet</NUMEX> tall and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">two feet</NUMEX> wide has been likened to the robot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">R2-D2</ENAMEX> -- can crack <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> an hour .
     Because fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> are less expensive than processed ones , a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can recover the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King </ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3,390</NUMEX> cost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months</TIMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard </ENAMEX>.
     Such centrifugal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">egg</TIMEX> breakers have been around since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX> .
     But when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> came forward with his machine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> nobody else was offering them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     The main reason : <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chickens</ENAMEX> carry this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> , which can cause upset stomachs and , in rare cases , death among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hens</ENAMEX> sometimes pass <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> , and it can also be found on unclean shells .
     Thus , any machine that breaks large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> at once has the potential to spread <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> if a bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> gets in with the good ones .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> claims this is a manageable problem .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King</ENAMEX> carries written instructions to break only high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> that have been properly sanitized and , as an added precaution , to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> only in products that will be cooked enough to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">bacteria</ENAMEX> .
     With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 4,000</NUMEX> machines in use , there have been no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> problems as long as instructions were followed , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> boasts .
     He says the handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> cases involving products that may have used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> broken by an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King</ENAMEX> stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products .
     But he says that 's no more a reason for banning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg Kings</ENAMEX> than bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are a reason for banning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> do n't buy such arguments .
     `` Human nature being what it is , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do n't always follow instructions , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Guzewich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> protection for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Health Department</ENAMEX> .
     Leading the assault against the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Egg King</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Egg Producers</ENAMEX> .

''
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">UEP</ENAMEX> declines to comment , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Frawley</ENAMEX> , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> 's actions are motivated solely by `` health concerns . ''
     An early battleground was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">facilities</ENAMEX> regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USDA </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food Safety Inspection Service</ENAMEX> .
     Unfortunately for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard </ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USDA </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Agricultural Marketing Service</ENAMEX> , was in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> .
     After receiving complaints from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> got the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> to rescind its approval , thus limiting the machine 's potential market to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bakeries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">establishments</ENAMEX> that are n't regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">USDA</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producers</ENAMEX> also lobbied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FDA</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Egg Producers</ENAMEX> said that there was `` little likelihood '' of a health problem as long as instructions were followed .
     So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> , where a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia</ENAMEX> introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> at the time was based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Santa Ana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , enlisted his local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> , and the battle was joined .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> finally defeated the measure , though it took a vote on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> to do it .
     Even then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> called an `` unscrupulous '' method for breaking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">eggs</ENAMEX> .
     Foiled in their effort to get a national ban , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> turned their attention to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">states</ENAMEX> .
     So far , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Georgia </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> have outlawed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> 's device , citing health concerns .
     An antitrust suit that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">United Egg Producers</ENAMEX> and others only added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> 's woes .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 100,000</NUMEX> in legal fees to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> says the ruling pushed his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">court</ENAMEX> .
     Now he has moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> where costs are lower , and started a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Adsi Inc.</ENAMEX> , to market his machine .
     But , so far , the change of scenery has n't ended his string of bad breaks .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> recently fell from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and fractured his arm .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> ca n't chew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gum</ENAMEX> and sing at the same time .
     But on the evidence of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Fabulous Baker Boys</ENAMEX> , '' that may be the only thing she ca n't do , at least when she 's acting in movies .
     As the tough , slinky lounge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chanteuse</ENAMEX> in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Fabulous Baker Boys</ENAMEX> , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> sings for herself , and more than passably well .
     Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie Diamond</ENAMEX> handles a song the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greats</ENAMEX> do , like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone .
     Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music .
     When she is n't performing for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> , she prepares for a song by removing the wad of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gum</ENAMEX> from her mouth , and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">gum</ENAMEX> back in .
     Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> seems like someone you 've seen before , in numerous show-biz stories -LRB- even her name , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie Diamond</ENAMEX> , sounds like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> must have played -RRB- .
     Yet nothing about `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Baker Boys</ENAMEX> , '' and certainly nothing about Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> , really is like something from the video <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">vault</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Kloves</ENAMEX> , the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> -LRB- he is n't yet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> -RRB- , has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> produced picture to his credit ; he wrote the screenplay for `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Racing With the Moon</ENAMEX> , '' a lovely coming-of-age picture set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the '40s</TIMEX> .
     Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older , someone who does n't dismiss dreams , but who also has enough experience to see his limits .
     However , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kloves</ENAMEX> directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace ; `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Baker Boys</ENAMEX> '' is both bluesy and funny .
     He 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched ; for example , the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> wows an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time she sings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> .
     Of course , it does n't hurt that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kloves</ENAMEX> has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> who know exactly what they 're doing .
     Much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ballhaus</ENAMEX> 's slyly seductive lens work .
     After working for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner Rainer Fassbinder</ENAMEX> , the late <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> , and more recently with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Scorsese</ENAMEX> -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">After Hours</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Color of Money</ENAMEX> , '' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Last Temptation of Christ</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballhaus</ENAMEX> has developed a distinctively fluid style .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Grusin</ENAMEX> 's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Feelings</ENAMEX> '' is a must -RRB- without condescension .
     Though Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are pretty great , too .
     What seemed like a good idea , to cast the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridges</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beau</ENAMEX> -RRB- as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> , actually turned out to be a good idea .
     Anyone who 's tried to appear `` natural '' in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stiff</ENAMEX> .
     So it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> is n't natural at all , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beau</ENAMEX> had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real .
     When the movie opens the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> are doing what they 've done for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15 years</TIMEX> professionally , and twice as long as that for themselves : They 're playing proficient piano , face-to-face , on twin pianos .
     They 're small time in the small time-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:HOTEL">hotels</ENAMEX> -LRB- not the best ones -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Seattle</ENAMEX> .
     Yet they do n't disparage their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> by disparaging their act .
     They wear tuxedos <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">most nights</TIMEX> , unless circumstances -LRB- a regular gig at a `` tropical '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">lounge</ENAMEX> , for example -RRB- require them to wear special costumes , like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> shirts .
     Plump <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beau</ENAMEX> , looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face , plays the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> plans the program , takes care of business , and approaches the work like any other job .
     He 's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">300 nights</TIMEX> a week as an ordinary job .
     He 's got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> in the suburbs ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> sees only the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">house</ENAMEX> , and only near the end of the movie .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> grovels a little for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookers</ENAMEX> , probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporation</ENAMEX> .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">his off-hours</TIMEX> he wears cardigan sweaters .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bridges</ENAMEX> is the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> , who fancies himself the rebellious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> ; he lives in a loft with his sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and the occasional visit from the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> upstairs , who climbs down the fire escape .
     Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played , and when , and he dutifully shows up for work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> -LRB- he consoles himself with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">booze</ENAMEX> and by showing up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     Looking leaner than he has in a while , the younger Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridges</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> , who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated .
     He can live with little pleasures .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kloves</ENAMEX> has put together some priceless moments .
     These include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Tilly</ENAMEX> 's audition to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker Boys</ENAMEX> ' girl <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tilly</ENAMEX> of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobster</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> on the television show , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Hill Street Blues</ENAMEX> . ''
     Here she delivers , especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Candy Man</ENAMEX> , '' which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could n't be more perfect .
     -LRB- It matches her voice . -RRB-
     And Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> 's particular version of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Making Whoopee</ENAMEX> '' -- and the way Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballhaus</ENAMEX> photographs her , from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> if Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> had n't gone and become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> in her own right .

     `` It 's the proverbial flight to safety . ''
     Despite recent declines in interest rates , money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> compound yield on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> taxable funds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBC\/Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.55 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.60 %</NUMEX> .
     Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a year</TIMEX> .
     Most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 %</NUMEX> or less at major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> , and the yields on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> 's auction fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.61 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.82 %</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">six months</TIMEX> .
     Money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</NUMEX> a week in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent months</TIMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negus</ENAMEX> said , reflecting the relatively high yields .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest week</TIMEX> , funds open to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institutions</ENAMEX> alone grew by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.8 billion</NUMEX> .
     Some fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> say inflows could increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">coming days</TIMEX> as a result of stock selling in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</NUMEX> point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .

     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are n't necessarily running scared , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litvack</ENAMEX> said .
     `` They 're maintaining their attitude toward investing , which has leaned toward the conservative recently . ''
     Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> adjust the maturities of their investments -- short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities , commercial paper and the like -- to capture the highest yields .
     Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling .
     The average maturity of the funds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBC\/Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> remained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">38 days</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the third consecutive week</TIMEX> .
     It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">as short as 29 days</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the start of this year</TIMEX> , when rates were marching steadily upward , and hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">42 days</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> simple yield of the funds fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.21 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.26 %</NUMEX> .
     The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-day</TIMEX> simple yield was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.26 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.27 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> before , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-day</TIMEX> compound yield slid to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.60 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.61 %</NUMEX> .
     Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average .
     The highest yielding taxable fund <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Harbor Money Market Fund</ENAMEX> , with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-day</TIMEX> compound yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.75 %</NUMEX> .

     whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina McNamee WCRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> created liar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Isuzu </ENAMEX>, among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom </ENAMEX>.
     The complex restructuring , which was long expected , transforms <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> from primarily a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of advertising into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> of advertising time and space .
     It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and headed jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Della Femina</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     The merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's admittedly ambitious goal : to become one of the world 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> , while attracting more multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> were able to attract alone .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> , where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , the move gives it a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina</ENAMEX> , and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide .
     It also gives the outspoken Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> -- who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> -- an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use .
     According to terms , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.02 billion French francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 318.6 million</NUMEX> -RRB- for the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> it does n't already own of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat Holding S.A.</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's largest media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> , which had held <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> 's ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> , will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 43.5 million</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 68.5 million</NUMEX> -RRB- to raise its stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> .
     That price also covers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> raising to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Belier Group</ENAMEX> , a joint venture ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> network it owns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> will also have the right to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the remaining 40 %</NUMEX> of the merged ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six years</TIMEX> .
     The transaction places the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> squarely at the helm of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> with the rather unwieldy name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd.</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EWDB</ENAMEX> .
     The merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> will include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina McNamee</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> 's various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Belier Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> 's other advertising and direct marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> will be joint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> with former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Wight</ENAMEX> .
     Both will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Breene</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> at the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     In an interview in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breene</ENAMEX> , fresh from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">Concorde</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Paris</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> had worked through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the night</TIMEX> , outlined big plans for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     `` Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> position ... by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of three years</TIMEX> from now .
     It implies very dramatic growth , '' he said .
     He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> had agreed to provide a development fund of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 100 million</NUMEX> for acquisitions .
     The new agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> is already in discussions about a possible purchase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Spain</ENAMEX> , while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breene</ENAMEX> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Germany</ENAMEX> and elsewhere .
     Cracking the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three years</TIMEX> will be difficult at best .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina</ENAMEX> had billings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $ 660 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> and ranked as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">24th</NUMEX>-largest ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     The merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that it now becomes part of will have billings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just more than $ 2.6 billion</NUMEX> -- most of that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> -- bringing it to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">about 14th</NUMEX> world-wide .
     To make it to top-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> status , it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Grey Advertising</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Omnicom</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX> .
     The merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">advertisers</ENAMEX> may prove equally difficult .
     When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina McNamee</ENAMEX> out of the merger of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> smaller agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> , it said it did so in order to attract larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , especially packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     Since then , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina</ENAMEX> won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> as an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> and also does work for a few packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX> .
     But major packaged-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">players</ENAMEX> of the world -- such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colgate-Palmolive</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> -- have steadfastly eluded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     `` <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of our favorite names , '' Mr. Della Femina calls that roster , adding hopefully , `` We 're a much more attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> to large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">multinationals</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> than we were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> . ''
     Still , the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> has seen .
     As part of the restructuring , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     What 's more , both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Gross</ENAMEX> , who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> , will acquire <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.99 %</NUMEX> stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX> , creating a powerful link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> will receive its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> stake as part of payment for the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> stake that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> is buying , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> said it expects to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 32 million</NUMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> stake .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , serving as a sort of `` creative conscience . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise McNamee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Della Femina</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , will continue running the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> .
     They and other top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> will receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> sum , which some industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> pegged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 million</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX> , for its part , will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming `` a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> for a series of media-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> will hold onto its public relations , TV programming and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> says its debt will be cut to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 24 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 66 million</NUMEX> as a result of the transaction .
     For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> , meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">alliance</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> is intended to strengthen its own push outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space .
     By buying the space in bulk , they obtain discounts <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 50 %</NUMEX> , which they can pass on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> .
     They thus have won the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> space-buying business of such advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">giants</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Fiat S.p . A.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> .
     But now , other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> wants to expand to the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     To help finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Carat</ENAMEX> purchase , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> said it plans an issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Euroconvertible</ENAMEX> preferred shares once the market settles down .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> added that `` in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets , '' it has arranged medium-term debt financing , which would be underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd .</ENAMEX>
     Earthquake 's Damage
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> 's earthquake brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> ad scene to a screeching halt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> , with only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> showing up at their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> , mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations .
     While no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> reported injuries to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> , the quake damaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">offices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.

     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bulgaria</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past five months</TIMEX> has been the lack of international attention .
     The deportation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 315,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">regime</ENAMEX> adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> .
     Yet some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are advancing a chilling casuistry : that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bulgaria</ENAMEX> , in other words , deserve what is coming to them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four centuries later</TIMEX> .
     As if this were n't enough , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> is getting into the act .
     On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> it approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> 's proposed commemorative resolution designating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 24 , 1990</TIMEX> , as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the `` National Day of Remembrance</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 75th Anniversary</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Armenian Genocide</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1915-1923</TIMEX> , '' suffered at the hands of the warring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> .
     There can be no quibbling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Armenians</ENAMEX> endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve .
     It puts great strain on a longstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> that has been one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">NATO</ENAMEX> .
     The resolution also comes at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> has been seeking help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> in resolving its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> has been fighting its past for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> , and thus far has been only partially successful .
     Must it now accept that one of its strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">allies</ENAMEX> blames it for the genocide of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ?
     Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> that surfaced when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> asked for assistance in dealing with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> emigration crisis .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> 's political problems lie with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> .
     Part of the problem some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> have with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> seems to stem from its location -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> is n't really part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     Why , they wonder , should it belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">EC</ENAMEX> ?
     Another anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> hook is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Islamic</ENAMEX> faith of the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> , we are told , is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> ; its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> simply wo n't fit in with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Western European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Judeo-Christian</ENAMEX> tradition .
     It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> comes to the fore .
     No one has to accept the sins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> to reject that argument .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> in any event is long past it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> has in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> accepted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> bordering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nations</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX> , suffering what many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Syria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Iraq</ENAMEX> have inundated eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Turkey</ENAMEX> .
     Now it is their fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> arriving as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bulgaria</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently .
     Surely , the past suffering of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten .
     But what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> has done in supporting the strongly worded <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> resolution achieves no useful end ; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Bulgaria</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has been behaving beyond the pale for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">months</TIMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past .

     If that takes money , take it away from this discredited federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">department</ENAMEX> .
     But of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrats</ENAMEX> pillorying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind .
     Instead , they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">This month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> .
     No doubt many of his ideas are worthy , but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is unlikely to go even that far .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     They were appalled , for instance , that he wanted to target more of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3 billion</NUMEX> Community Development Block Grant -LRB- CDBG -RRB- program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious `` discretionary '' funds that have allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to steer contracts to political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cronies</ENAMEX> .
     These development grants mainly enrich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> who want to put up shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">centers</ENAMEX> and parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">garages</ENAMEX> .
     They also give those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> political credit for bringing home the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">pork</ENAMEX> , and so they are popular with such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Rose Oakar</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakar</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Democrat</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> , wants a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.9 million</NUMEX> grant so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> can build an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> .
     She says it 'd create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> jobs and bring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> tourist revenue .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> says that rock 'n' roll <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> and the music industry ought to put up the money .
     At the hearing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakar</ENAMEX> started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">housing</ENAMEX> for downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Cleveland</ENAMEX> . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chalmers Wylie</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> , rallied to the cause : `` I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlelady</ENAMEX> is making an important statement .
     The implication that if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong , I think is most unfortunate . ''
     We 're sure some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> can explain the difference between what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:POLITICAL">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> have been doing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> and what these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentleladies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> want to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> .
     Our view is that given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> 's attitude toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">place</ENAMEX> probably is beyond reform .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">more than 50 years</TIMEX> the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> has tried various ways to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">housing</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> and revive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> .
     In the process <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> has wasted untold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> , created slums and invited corruption .
     Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> 's spending actually is disguised welfare for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> or the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> .
     That includes the CDBG funds and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> , which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> in the hole .
     Selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">FHA</ENAMEX> 's loan portfolio to the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> would save the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> untold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> in future losses .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> money actually does trickle down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> , and zeroing out housing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middlemen</ENAMEX> would free up more money for public housing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> to manage and even own their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">units</ENAMEX> .
     The rest ought to be used to clean out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drugs</ENAMEX> from the neighbhorhoods .
     Rival <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> have turned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> into combat zones .
     Even suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Prince George 's County</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Md.</ENAMEX> , reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> there have been a record <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> killings there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , most of them drug-related .
     Innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bystanders</ENAMEX> often are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Miami</ENAMEX> drug battle .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">three-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was used as a shield by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:DRUG">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> .
     Decent life in the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">cities</ENAMEX> wo n't be restored unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> reclaims the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">streets</ENAMEX> from the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> .
     Until then , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted .
     It 's still unclear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> wants to completely overhaul the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">room</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> or just tighten a few screws here and there .
     No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged .
     Having seen the hypocrisy with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> has addressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals , we disagree .
     It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">HUD</ENAMEX> has become and channel the resources into the drug war .

     Natural upheavals , and most particularly earthquakes , are not only horrible realities in and of themselves , but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed .
     The rubble after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> earthquake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> disclosed , quite literally , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">city</ENAMEX> whose larger structures had been built with sand .
     The extent of the disaster stemmed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference .
     The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is surely with the state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy .
     Did the stock-market tremors of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday , Oct. 13</TIMEX> , presage larger fragility , far greater upheavals ?
     Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BRIDGE">spans</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:BRIDGE">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> ?
     The eerie complacency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> era has produced <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:OTHER">Panglossian</ENAMEX> paeans about the present perfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic and social arrangements .
     A licensed government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Fukuyama</ENAMEX> , recently announced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The National Interest</ENAMEX> that history is , so to speak , at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> civilization .
     His observations were taken seriously .
     But we are , in reality , witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism : not so much the end of history but the history of the end .
     The financial equivalent of the sand used by those <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">contractors</ENAMEX> is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Builders</ENAMEX> get away with using sand and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> junk when society decides it 's okay , necessary even , to look the other way .
     And by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> had ample reason to welcome junk bonds , to look the other way .
     By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment .
     Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1965</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.2 %</NUMEX> .
     That same calculation saw profit rates fall to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> in the recession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">year 1982</TIMEX> and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.1 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Tobin</ENAMEX> .
     In theory , the value attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same .
     But of course the market could decide that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> is not producing profits .
     This is indeed what the market decided .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1982</TIMEX> the ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43.5 %</NUMEX> , meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's assets at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">43 cents</NUMEX> .
     From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 43 cents</NUMEX> to buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a dollar</NUMEX> 's worth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> 's capital stock , an alert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> wo n't look the other way .
     His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits , thus restoring the market 's faith in them .
     Hence the LBO craze .
     But here is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way .
     The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 65 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68.9 %</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     Result : a landscape littered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">lemons</ENAMEX> , huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> .
     The mounting risks did not go unobserved , even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> .
     But there were enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> announcing the end of history -LRB- in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity -RRB- for society to continue shielding its eyes .
     Mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> , craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing , swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs , claimed the end result would be a leaner , meaner corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> , with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall .
     But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> were those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> whose icon was the topic figure of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">'80s</TIMEX> capitalism , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 517 million</NUMEX> salary in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">one year</TIMEX> .
     Left-stream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> I associate with -- fellows in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Union of Radical Political Economists</ENAMEX> , most particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pollin</ENAMEX> of the economics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">University of California at Riverside</ENAMEX> -- were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> .
     All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities .
     Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher , and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow .
     The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up .
     In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Harvard</ENAMEX> study published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April of this year</TIMEX> -LRB- and discussed in a lead story in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 18</TIMEX> -RRB- found the default rate on these junk bonds is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX> .
     What is the consequence of a high-interest burden , high default rates and continued low profitability ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">Corporations</ENAMEX> need liquidity , in the form of borrowed funds .
     Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits , they look to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts .
     The consequence can be inflation , brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash .
     Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort : an assault on wages .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fukuyama</ENAMEX> , peering through binoculars at the end of history , said in his essay that `` the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West ...
     the egalitarianism of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fukuyama</ENAMEX> might want to consult some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> on the subject of class and egalitarianism .
     From its peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1972</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 198.41</NUMEX> , the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">weekly</TIMEX> wage had fallen to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 169.28</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> -- both figures being expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1977</TIMEX> dollars .
     In other words , after the glory boom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> , wages had sunk from the post <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:WAR">World War II</ENAMEX> peak by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 %</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> , helped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> , turned down the screws or went offshore .
     But there are signs now -- the strikes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> , etc. -- that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted .
     These are long-term Richter readings on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> capitalism .
     The whole structure is extremely shaky .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">Governments</ENAMEX> have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic -LRB- a word the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Times</ENAMEX> forbade my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1929</TIMEX> -RRB- .
     But sophistication has its limits .
     The S&L bailout could cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300 billion</NUMEX> , computing interest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's loans .
     These are real costs .
     Under what weights will the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</ENAMEX> totter ?
     Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks , but there are fault lines -- the crisis in profits , the assault on wages , the structural inequity of the system -- that make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX> of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cockburn</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">The Nation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LA Weekly</ENAMEX> .
