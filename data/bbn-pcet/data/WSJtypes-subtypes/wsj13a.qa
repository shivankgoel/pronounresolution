     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The debt-rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> cited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's move into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> 's past performance .

     At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's of London</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are ushered into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">premises</ENAMEX> by red-frocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doormen</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">coffeehouse</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">17th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> , once a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">pillar</ENAMEX> of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">301-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is battered by enormous claims from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decade</TIMEX>-long run of unprecedented disasters , the most recent of which is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Bay Area</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is besieged by disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is on the ropes , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Nutting</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">17 years</TIMEX> who now leads a dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> threatening to sue exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> for alleged mismanagement and negligence .
     `` It needs more discipline .
     It needs to sort itself out . ''
     Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well-heeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> -LRB- some of them royal -RRB- who , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 360</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicates</ENAMEX> , underwrite policies .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 1,750</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> quit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> , more than triple the number of resignations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     Names are resigning at an even faster pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     Lackluster returns are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason .
     The average after-tax return on investment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the most recent year</TIMEX> for which results are available , was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chatset Ltd.</ENAMEX> , an insurance consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> .
     In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , it was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 %</NUMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">Between 1981 and 1986</TIMEX> , the most recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five-year</TIMEX> period for which figures are available , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> reported over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 3.6 billion</NUMEX> in claims and reserves against future losses -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.7 billion</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's exchange rates -RRB- , more than double the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 1.35 billion</NUMEX> posted in the previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five-year</TIMEX> period .
     Many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,329</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who remain are beginning to question one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
     And catastrophes are getting ever more costly .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> claims for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:OTHER">Piper Alpha</ENAMEX> oil-rig disaster in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea</ENAMEX> , for instance , may reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</NUMEX> .
     During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">five-year</TIMEX> period ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 80 %</NUMEX> of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chatset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> .
     The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now .
     `` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Atkins</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> from suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , says .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins </ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> membership was a bonus from a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">employer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1981</TIMEX> , belongs to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nutting</ENAMEX> 's dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Outhwaite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicate</ENAMEX> , which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims .
     Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX> , who underwrote <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 20,000</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 32,000</NUMEX> , of insurance coverage on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicate</ENAMEX> , now faces potential losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly # 70,000</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 111,000</NUMEX> .
     `` If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> wants <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 70,000</NUMEX> out of me they will have to take everything I 've got -- and even then I do n't know if it will be enough , '' she says .
     Unease is widespread among exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> .
     `` I ca n't think of any reason to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> now , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Whitten </ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1979</TIMEX> .
     `` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
     If profits do n't improve , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> says he may quit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> .
     Meanwhile , competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> unencumbered by history is intensifying .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance .
     Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past decade</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> have chipped away at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's share of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 2.5 billion</NUMEX> marine market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> , where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> are insured .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 %</NUMEX> stake in that market has shrunk to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> in that period , according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Institute of London Underwriters</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitor</ENAMEX> .
     -LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> asked not to be named . -RRB-
     Much of the business has gone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">institute</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">association</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz Versicherungs AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Commercial Union Assurance PLC</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> has endured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">decades</TIMEX> of genteel decline .
     At the peak of its power and influence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a century ago</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> dominated the insurance world with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> stake .
     It virtually dictated how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">ports</ENAMEX> around the globe .
     Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 %</NUMEX> .
     -LRB- Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . -RRB-
     Bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">rivals</ENAMEX> , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> , backed by armies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statisticians</ENAMEX> using computers in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">branches</ENAMEX> , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> say .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> pioneered such now-standard policies as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> ' liability insurance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> now underwrite most of that business .
     Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> for industry-specific coverage .
     Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Only 10 years ago</TIMEX> , for instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> was the pre-eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> of thoroughbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> .
     But since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1981</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kirk Horse Insurance Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lexington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Ky.</ENAMEX> has grabbed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> stake of the market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Kirk </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> has suffered because its structure does n't allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> to deal directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">clients</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> are required intermediaries .
     Thus , he asserts , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> ca n't react quickly to competition .
     `` Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation , '' he says .
     `` They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Lawrence </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , agrees the exchange faces big challenges .
     `` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says .
     `` We have been a great market for inventing risks which other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> then take , copy and cut rates . ''
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .
     By that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> , he says , must find new products and new markets .
     That wo n't be an easy task .
     Tradition is dictator at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Three years ago</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> took up residence in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">space-age</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">steel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">glass</ENAMEX> -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Britain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> has denounced .
     -LRB- Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wags</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> `` the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">rig</ENAMEX> . '' -RRB-
     But along with such treasured artifacts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> 's spyglass , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> also brought its outmoded ways of doing business .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> market actively underwrites insurance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 4 1\/2 hours</TIMEX> a day , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> say .
     Underwriting does n't get under way until after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tea</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m</TIMEX> .
     A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> lunch break follows .
     Things wind down at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 4:30 p.m.</TIMEX> , just in time for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">tea</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> vast trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hall</ENAMEX> houses a warren of well-polished desks .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">hall</ENAMEX> 's few computers are used mostly to send messages .
     Sandwiched between desks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokers</ENAMEX> clutching thick folders stand in lines , waiting their turn to speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> .
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> may have to approach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> who insure the endeavors on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">syndicates</ENAMEX> .
     It could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six months</TIMEX> for a claim to be paid .
     `` The system , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Samengo-Turner</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> who left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1985</TIMEX> , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . ''
     Some maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> also have been inept .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wetherell</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">underwriter</ENAMEX> , says he and his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> underestimated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50 %</NUMEX> the premiums they should have charged for property risks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">from 1980 to 1985</TIMEX> .
     `` How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he says .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> decline to comment on the matter .
     More recently , property rates have increased .
     Many at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
     But it will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">years</TIMEX> before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters .
     The magnitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's problems may not become known for some time because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> practice of leaving the books open for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three years</TIMEX> to allow for the settlement of claims .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> only recently reported its financial results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">That year</TIMEX> , it posted record pretax profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 650 million</NUMEX> , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says reported profit will be down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1987</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1988</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">1989</TIMEX> , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be .
     Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 600 million</NUMEX> in aviation losses -LRB- including the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> airline disaster over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Scotland</ENAMEX> -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about # 11 billion</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
     Meanwhile , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> has been trying to lower costs .
     -LRB- It recently cut its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">213</NUMEX> . -RRB-
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wetherell</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriter</ENAMEX> , reckons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> .
     Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> has talked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> about computerizing underwriting transactions , the effort has n't gotten very far .
     Competition among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> makes them loath to centralize price and policy information .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> cling to traditional face-to-face dealings , even for routine policies .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> have been pressing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">years</TIMEX> to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> presently sells only auto insurance directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Canada</ENAMEX> .
     But such changes must be cleared by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committees</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> before being implemented .
     The proposal to sell directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Lloyd 's</ENAMEX> is moving forward on some fronts , though .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims .
     By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> , all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa Securities Co.</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masahiro Dozen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadakane Doi</ENAMEX> , who will become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice chairman</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshitoki Chino</ENAMEX> retains his title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> usually is in charge of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">day</TIMEX> operations , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> 's role is more a ceremonial one .
     The title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> is n't used .
     While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">internationalists</ENAMEX> , expected that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">52</TIMEX> , would eventually become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , the speed of his promotion surprised many .
     It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">only earlier this year</TIMEX> that the jovial , easygoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> -- he likes to joke with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy president</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> is taking over the reins of a securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> is one of the world 's largest securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> .
     As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March 31</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> had shareholder equity of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">801.21 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.64 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the six months ended Sept. 30</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> reported unconsolidated -LRB- parent company -RRB- net income of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79.03 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 556.5 million</NUMEX> -RRB- on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">332.38 billion yen</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.34 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     Both figures were record highs .
     Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> interpreted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> 's appointment as an attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> to make its international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> more profitable while preparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> for the effects of the continuing deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition .
     All of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's so-called Big Four securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</ENAMEX> , the world 's largest , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets .
     While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have never had a large appetite for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> equities .
     And while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have stepped up their purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> shares in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past several months</TIMEX> , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">brethren</ENAMEX> have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">competitors</ENAMEX> that have prevented them from building strong links to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> knows these problems firsthand .
     When he arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1969</TIMEX> -- the start of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">eight-year</TIMEX> tour -- he tried selling <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> yen-denominated bonds to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     `` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koji Yoneyama</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     `` But not a single piece of paper was sold . ''
     By his own account , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> did n't do much better with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> bonds .
     In an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> , he recalled how after some training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> corporate bond issues .
     But he could n't sell any .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> bonds ?
     Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> even related the indignity suffered when he and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> went on an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> fishing expedition off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> shore and caught nothing .
     Upon returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , `` Exhausted , I got into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">taxicab</ENAMEX> , and the woman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> said : ` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> make better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> , ' '' he recalled .
     Undaunted , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">organization</ENAMEX> with maybe some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> flavor to it . ''
     He said that he was particularly interested in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market and its links to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> and institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> upon his graduation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:EDUCATIONAL">Kyoto University</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1959</TIMEX> .
     Like many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , he began his career peddling stock to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     In his climb to the top , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> also headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> and its international operations .
     `` He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takuro Isoda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     But it Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> 's experience as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> -- to accede to the presidency .
     Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> ' earnings .
     And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> `` would be fragile , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> .
     If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> has a weakness , it may be his golf game .
     `` He digs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">sand</ENAMEX> instead of hitting the ball , like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoneyama</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco Ltd.</ENAMEX> posted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</NUMEX> decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> net income , a performance that was in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> ' expectations .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">nickel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> also raised its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> dividend to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX> a share from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 cents</NUMEX> and said it may buy back <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 4.8 %</NUMEX> of its common outstanding .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> shares fell after the announcements .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were disappointed that the cash-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> had failed to announce a special dividend .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 31.125</NUMEX> a share , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62.5 cents</NUMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> , which had cash reserves of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 272 million</NUMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> , could still announce a special dividend in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the next few months</TIMEX> , though it would be smaller than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10</NUMEX>-a-share special dividend it paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> dividend is payable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Dec. 1</TIMEX> to shares of record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Nov. 3</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> 's net fell to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 129.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.23</NUMEX> a share , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200.3 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.88</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .
     Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.2 %</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 848.7 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 784.5 million</NUMEX> .
     Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 117.7 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.12</NUMEX> a share , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 187.4 million</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.76</NUMEX> a share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Manitoba</ENAMEX> operations due to high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">arsenic</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">ore</ENAMEX> .

     Under a previous buyback program , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Inco</ENAMEX> has purchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7 million</NUMEX> of its shares since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">parent</ENAMEX> should remain independent for now .
     As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen M. Wolf</ENAMEX> , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> developments put the acquisition attempt back to square <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility .
     The effort to create the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's largest employee-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> began unraveling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> when the labor-management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> was unable to obtain financing for its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 300</NUMEX>-a-share , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 6.79 billion</NUMEX> offer .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just last week</TIMEX> it suffered another major setback when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> , the largest equity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investor</ENAMEX> in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .
     Takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> , focusing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> , which had risen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 9.875</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 178.375</NUMEX> in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> on reports of a new bid being prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:09 p.m.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">EDT</ENAMEX> announcement .
     Among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trades reported by the securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Jefferies & Co.</ENAMEX> , which makes a market in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">exchange</ENAMEX> is closed , were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 170</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 162</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 162</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 158</NUMEX> .
     The rebound in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular trading hours</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Monday</TIMEX> was its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">daily</TIMEX> gain after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> consecutive losses left the price <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 %</NUMEX> below its level before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 13</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> met at a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-hour</TIMEX> meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> for a revised bid .
     But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> said it was n't interested for now .
     That proposal , valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $ 225 and $ 240</NUMEX> a share , would have transferred majority ownership to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> while leaving some stock in public hands .
     The buy-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> had no firm financing for the plan .
     And , with no other offers on the table , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> apparently felt no pressure to act on it .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . ''
     But it was clear that for the time being , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> to return to normalcy .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> said it concluded that `` the welfare of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> , its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> ... can best be enhanced by continued development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> as a strong , viable , independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> urged all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture ... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> . ''
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> faces a monumental task in pulling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> back together again .
     Labor problems top the list .
     For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     In return for an ownership stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were willing to agree to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">seven-year</TIMEX> contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> previously resisted .
     That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out .
     As a `` good-will measure , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had been working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four extra hours</TIMEX> a month and had agreed to fly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:VEHICLE">747-400</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">aircraft</ENAMEX> .
     It 's uncertain if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> will continue to do so without a contract settlement .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late last night</TIMEX> that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . ''
     The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">United</ENAMEX> 's pilot and machinist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> helped cool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> ' interest in financing the transaction .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> previously had shown themselves to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">ally</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf </ENAMEX>, but he lost much of his credibility with that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> when he teamed up with the pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machinists</ENAMEX> criticized the terms Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> received in the buy-out .
     They paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> stake and received <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 9 %</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> at no additional cost .
     His credibility is also on the line in the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> .
     Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> was regarded as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> 's savviest airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> after engineering turnarounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tiger International Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Republic Airlines</ENAMEX> .
     But he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Pope</ENAMEX> , sowed some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">seeds</ENAMEX> for the deal 's failure by insisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">banks</ENAMEX> accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 114.3 million</NUMEX> they stood to gain from sale of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock and options .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> 's actions leave takeover stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> nursing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $ 700 million</NUMEX> in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer .
     It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Arbitragers</ENAMEX> said they were disappointed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> may oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> by a majority vote .
     The machinists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> and a minority ownership stake for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> , whose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 240</NUMEX>-a-share offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">airline</ENAMEX> .
     However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">UAL</ENAMEX> data .
     Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 300</NUMEX> a share .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> 's decision is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> said that it would n't invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> is seeking major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">investors</ENAMEX> to back its attempt to crack the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</NUMEX> market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
     Those chips were in dire shortage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">last year</TIMEX> , hurting many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that could n't get sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>-supplied chips .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 million to $ 50 million</NUMEX> investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> is seeking from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> .
     `` <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">At this time</TIMEX> , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Juge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of market planning .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Kane</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> ' failure .
     `` I would like to have had them , '' he said .
     But `` they were n't on my list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> who were critical to be a part of it . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last June</TIMEX> , when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> was formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">LSI Logic Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">National Semiconductor Corp .</ENAMEX>
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he expects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">corporations</ENAMEX> to announce their participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> soon after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> finishes a business plan , probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late this week</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> said it 's still actively evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> and plans to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">later this week</TIMEX> .

     In a startling turnabout , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , is upset that someone leaked a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">administration</ENAMEX> suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> would undertake to warn <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination .
     With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leakers</ENAMEX> are performing a public service .
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> has become a protection service for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ought to know .
     What went wrong in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Panama</ENAMEX> is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
     Naturally , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committee</ENAMEX> would like free rein to blame the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity .
     But there 's no danger of exposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC:HIGHWAY_STREET">Pennsylvania Avenue</ENAMEX> .
     And if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy , it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Panamanian</ENAMEX> armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to move against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> .
     When they did , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:HIGHWAY_STREET">roads</ENAMEX> .
     The executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">branch</ENAMEX> bears the first responsibility for timidity .
     But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> ?
     For example , what exactly did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giroldi</ENAMEX> and his fellow coup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> laws and executive orders on assassinations ?
     What part did <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> warnings play in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">major</ENAMEX> 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> in custody , but was under attack by pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> ?
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">pistol</ENAMEX> .
     Maybe we need a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Miranda</ENAMEX> warning : You have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you .
     Or maybe a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Surgeon General</ENAMEX> 's warning : Confiding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">United States</ENAMEX> may be fatal .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> , hardly a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">malcontent</ENAMEX> , got the debate started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> paralysis during the coup .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Operations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Stoltz</ENAMEX> , tried to smooth things over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a few days later</TIMEX> , but instead simply underlined Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster </ENAMEX>'s point .
     `` The interpretation '' of the executive order , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltz</ENAMEX> said , `` and the way in which the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">committees</ENAMEX> have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> , including me . ''
     In other words , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> wo n't let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA </ENAMEX>.
     The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
     And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Congress</ENAMEX> carries heavy penalties .
     Witness the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> prosecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ollie North</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> 's ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:RELIGION">Republican</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> , joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> to write a best seller about <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:OTHER">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> , deploring `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> of Zeal . ''
     No doubt many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">CIA</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">National Security Council</ENAMEX> have read it .
     What kind of initiative should anyone expect from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
     Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cohen</ENAMEX> morality play ?
     The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Vietnam</ENAMEX> syndrome against any executive action .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> would do himself and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">America</ENAMEX> 's national security .
     There are of course good reasons the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> should start passing out exploding cigars .
     The world being the nasty place it is , we want <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed .
     In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> takes the responsibility .
     The executive order and the reported agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> are neither sensible nor moral .
     As it now stands , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> can bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Tripoli</ENAMEX> , but ca n't `` assassinate '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gadhafi</ENAMEX> .
     It can send a fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squadron</ENAMEX> to strafe terrorist hideouts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Bekaa Valley</ENAMEX> , but ca n't shoot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Nidal</ENAMEX> .
     Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Washington</ENAMEX> are telling the world that the only way the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> will kill a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">madman</ENAMEX> is by making sure we take some innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> with him .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> said its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings slipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> as profits from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> sagged .
     All cleanup costs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last spring</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> oil spill were reflected in earlier results , it said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX> also reported declines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">quarterly</TIMEX> profit , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ashland Oil Inc.</ENAMEX> posted a loss for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Amerada Hess Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX> reported higher earnings .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> spent heavily during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the latest quarter</TIMEX> to clean up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill , those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 880 million</NUMEX> in charges taken during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the first half</TIMEX> .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said that at this time the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> spilled when one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">tankers</ENAMEX> rammed into an underwater reef .
     She added , however , that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill .
     She said that impact ca n't be reasonably assessed yet .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> 's net income during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.11 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87 cents</NUMEX> a share , from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.22 billion</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">93 cents</NUMEX> a share , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> 's profitability , like that of many other oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , was hurt during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter</TIMEX> by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> 's earnings from chemicals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 90 million</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 254 million</NUMEX> , while refining and marketing profits declined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 180 million</NUMEX> , to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 357 million</NUMEX> .
     Although crude oil prices were significantly higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> , they were n't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">sectors</ENAMEX> at most oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randol </ENAMEX>, oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp .</ENAMEX>
     He estimates that the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.04</NUMEX> a barrel higher during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the third quarter of this year</TIMEX> than in the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ashland</ENAMEX> also took a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 25 million</NUMEX> after-tax charge to cover anticipated costs to correct problems with boilers built by one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">refiner</ENAMEX> also booked a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15 million</NUMEX> charge for selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ashland Technology Corp.</ENAMEX> , one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> , at a loss .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Hess</ENAMEX> 's earnings were up despite a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 30 million</NUMEX> charge to cover the cost of maintaining operations after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> heavily damaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">refinery</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">St. Croix</ENAMEX> .

     Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.J. Silas</ENAMEX> in a statement .
     Despite higher oil prices , exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:LAKE_SEA_OCEAN">North Sea</ENAMEX> oil fields .

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downey</ENAMEX> said he is not going to change his style , which some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive .
     `` But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> dumped stocks of big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> whose earnings fluctuate with the economy .
     Many of those `` cyclical '' issues are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.23</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2662.91</NUMEX> .
     Declining issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> outpaced advancers , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,012</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501</NUMEX> .
     Recession fears are springing up again among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> say that the selling of cyclical stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> will be followed by a sell-off in shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with big debt loads on their balance sheets .
     In an economic slowdown , heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> because cash that would normally be used to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> buoyant must be diverted to interest payments .
     On the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> beat a clear path <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to blue-chip issues with proven earnings growth records .
     Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials , they bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> and sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aluminum Co. of America</ENAMEX> .
     In another sign of slowdown fears , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> dumped technology shares .
     Many money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are bracing for a decline in stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with big debt loads on their balance sheets .
     `` The junk bond market is being taken apart '' because of recession fears , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. David Mills</ENAMEX> , senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Boston Company Advisers</ENAMEX> .
     `` Under this scrutiny , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thing you do is sell your over-leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> . ''
     In fact , much of the buying in blue chips <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was a pursuit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> with lower debt levels .
     In a recent investment letter entitled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Winners of the ` Leverage Wars</ENAMEX> , ' '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kerschner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> 's investment policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> buy stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that have avoided loading up on debt .
     `` We 're saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> have to pay increasing attention to balance sheets , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerschner</ENAMEX> .
     He suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> buy the shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">J.

     He said that all of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> will be able to compete fiercely in an economic downturn .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">McDonald 's</ENAMEX> has long-term debt equaling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</NUMEX> of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerschner</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> is carrying real estate assets at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 2.6 billion</NUMEX> below their real value .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> slipped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 7\/8</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Sara Lee</ENAMEX> closed unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 1\/8</NUMEX> .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> ' `` stub '' stock index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">From January to early September</TIMEX> , the index of stub stocks -- the tiny portion of equity that 's publicly traded following a recapitalization -- outperformed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-stock index by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</NUMEX> .

     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hacksaw</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonecrusher</ENAMEX> '' are the sort of nicknames normally associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linebackers</ENAMEX> and heavyweight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contenders</ENAMEX> .
     Who 'd have thought that the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> carrying around reputations like that would be school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendents</ENAMEX> ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> 's new school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> is the hard-nosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kimbrough</ENAMEX> .
     At his old job in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Compton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , he took a bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> .
     At his first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> press conference , he berated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> .
     In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Fernandez </ENAMEX>, has landed like a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:1D">16-inch</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:WEAPON">shell</ENAMEX> in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> fit the mood of the times -- the mood being one of a public fed up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> ' rationalizations for why their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> do n't work .
     Former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Patterson</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">N.J.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Clark</ENAMEX> was no doubt the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> 's first experience with this new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> of no-nonsense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> .
     The subject of the movie `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Lean on Me </ENAMEX>, '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> controlled his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> with a bullhorn and a baseball bat .
     He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> from the same gravel-chewing mold ?
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elena Scambio</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> assigned to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Jersey City</ENAMEX> school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">system</ENAMEX> that was taken over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:STATE_PROVINCE">state</ENAMEX> , says her top priority will be to `` cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> does n't take control in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> , but already he 's roiling the waters .
     He 's attacked the concept of `` building tenure , '' one of the most disgraceful institutions in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> .
     It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> .
     Once they are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> , they stay .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">South Bronx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> kept his job for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">16 years</TIMEX> , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work .
     He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack .
     Naturally , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">union</ENAMEX> loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge .
     We suggest that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> find an incompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> , toss him out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">building</ENAMEX> and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of the status quo explain to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> whatever it is they 're defending .
     In his old job , as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:OTHER">Dade County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> forced out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and reshuffled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> .
     He cut the dropout rate by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 %</NUMEX> .
     But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well ; incompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> should go , but the good ones ought to be left alone .
     The situation will be especially delicate for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimbrough</ENAMEX> .
     He takes over a school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">system</ENAMEX> in the midst of radical reform .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Chicagoans</ENAMEX> have just elected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> neophyte school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">boards</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">school</ENAMEX> .
     This of course led to disaster in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> .
     Getting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to care again about its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> is essential , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Chicago</ENAMEX> the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">boards</ENAMEX> will make mistakes and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimbrough</ENAMEX> will have to identify them .
     The rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendents</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Fernandez</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kimbrough</ENAMEX> suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">systems</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> ' central mission , educating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> , became subsumed by the competing interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">unions</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">classroom</ENAMEX> itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> stopped learning .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chips</ENAMEX> was a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> , and maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">some day</TIMEX> he 'll return .
     Until then , it 's clear that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who 've been keeping big-city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">schools</ENAMEX> down are going to be dealing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terminator</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll Publications Co.</ENAMEX> agreed to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New Haven Register</ENAMEX> in a transaction valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 275 million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson Newspaper Group Inc</ENAMEX> .
     As part of the agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> also terminated the contract under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> manages <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> , ending a long association between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> that has turned increasingly bitter recently .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> has accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">St. Louis Sun</ENAMEX> .
     Under the terms of the accord , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 255 million</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Register</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">daily</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> bought for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 170 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the additional $ 20 million</NUMEX> in settlement of the management contract .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> also announced that it hired the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">papers</ENAMEX> .
     Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> after clashes with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll Jr</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morristown Daily Record</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 155 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1987</TIMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New Haven</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> , was purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> 's behalf as part of the management contract .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have said that the purchase price for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">paper</ENAMEX> was too high , causing a strain on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> 's finances .
     Investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> is seeking a new bank credit line of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 190 million</NUMEX> and may have to sell additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David N. Hurwitz</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> , said in a telephone interview that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> does n't currently have any plans to sell additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Carr</ENAMEX> , former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll Publications</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Cockburn</ENAMEX> , former senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> , would head the new in-house management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> , which had revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 225 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1988</TIMEX> .
     The association between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> stretches back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">thirty years</TIMEX> to a friendship between television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Goodson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latter</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll Jr.</ENAMEX> , took over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> and has been managing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> properties and acting as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">newspapers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> .
     But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">recent years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">empire</ENAMEX> in partnership with investment banking firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Warburg , Pincus & Co</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">dailies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> other non-daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">papers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> said its revenue will exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 750 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M.

     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX> , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past few years</TIMEX> , it has become increasingly clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph</ENAMEX> and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> whose sole interest and responsibility is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">papers</ENAMEX> .

     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Just five months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX> was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , said he is leaving to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express Co</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">59 years old</TIMEX> , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , whose largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> , to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> 's executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for corporate affairs and communications .
     He will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry L. Freeman</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">57</TIMEX> , who has said he will retire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> that he would retire by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the end of this year</TIMEX> to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmond Safra</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safra</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> later apologized and agreed to make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8 million</NUMEX> in contributions to charities chosen by him .
     Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> is retiring , he will continue to work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> on a project basis .
     Ad industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> were n't surprised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> 's decision to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">London</ENAMEX> before succumbing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">May</TIMEX> .
     And although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP</ENAMEX> 's chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sorrell</ENAMEX> , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> close to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> say he was unhappy giving up control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> , a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , to cut costs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> will be succeeded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's flagship ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">50</TIMEX> , who had been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> and who , like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell </ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Brody </ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:AGE">56</TIMEX> , will take on the newly created position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the world-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of its international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     He had been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operations</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> also had overseen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Scali McCabe Sloves</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> and its research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> , but those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> will now report directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> appears custom-made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> job .
     Known as a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , he is very much in the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> mold .
     Moreover , after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">26 years</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safra</ENAMEX> incident .
     He also is close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Robinson III</ENAMEX> .
     Aside from working with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> advertising account for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">about 11 years</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> serves on several of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">charities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">boards</ENAMEX> as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> .
     The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> had been pushed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's top spot by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance sending a note with a case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wine</ENAMEX> -LRB- The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wine</ENAMEX> , naturally , was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> 's brand , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">client</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
     `` He asked me not to resign .
     The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell </ENAMEX>, traveling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Far East</ENAMEX> , could n't be reached .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> first approached him about the job in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late September </TIMEX>.
     According to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sutherland</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ireland</ENAMEX> , was also a serious contender for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> job .
     Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> on international matters .
     After talking on and off for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past four weeks</TIMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> in very strong hands .
     It was my decision , not anyone else 's . ''
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips </ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could hardly be more different .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> comes across as a low-key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> has a flashier personality .
     During time off , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> tends to his garden ; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">planes</ENAMEX> .
     Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> say that although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> used to clash more frequently , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover brought them closer together .
     `` I 'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who made him <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">North America</ENAMEX> , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell </ENAMEX>-RCB- as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> .
     Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> asked .
     He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips </ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">boat</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">units</ENAMEX> .
     `` I consider this a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> career , '' he said .
     He also will sit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> 's corporate planning and policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">committee</ENAMEX> , made up of the top corporate and operating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">American Express</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> 's relationships with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> are based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agencies</ENAMEX> ' work , and will continue to be , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hurwitt</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> .
     But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expressed concern that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> is n't as well-known to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> was my key contact , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Nicholas Hahn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cotton Inc.</ENAMEX> , which represents <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> .
     `` I do n't know -LCB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> -RCB- all that well .
     I have n't seen or talked to him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">several years</TIMEX> . ''
     And some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> questioned whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> would have the skills <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> needs to turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> around .
     While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">office</ENAMEX> has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> .
     `` I think -LCB- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> -RCB- is going to need some help .
     I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Hill </ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Wertheim & Co</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> 's top creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Berry</ENAMEX> , left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">agency</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Berry</ENAMEX> was a creative inspiration at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> .
     But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said that having Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> would make for a smooth transition .
     `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell </ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wallach</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> .
     `` It 's probably a reasonable transition .

     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">operator</ENAMEX> of cable-television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> said the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> will produce movies that will premiere on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Network Television</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">channel</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TNT</ENAMEX> , and then will be released internationally in movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">theaters</ENAMEX> .

     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> , was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Hogan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Entertainment Networks</ENAMEX> , was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">unit</ENAMEX> .
     In an interview , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">subsidiary</ENAMEX> 's primary mission will be to make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">TNT</ENAMEX> and to distribute them internationally .
     But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
     `` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> , '' he said , adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> may develop such movies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next year</TIMEX> for domestic release in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1991</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Turner</ENAMEX> has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">networks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">recent years</TIMEX> , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> has never acted as a full-fledged movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">studio</ENAMEX> and released its own pictures to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">theaters</ENAMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> said `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">The Secret Life of Ian Fleming</ENAMEX> '' and `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART:OTHER">Treasure Island</ENAMEX> '' cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 6 million</NUMEX> each to make , which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about one-third</NUMEX> the cost of most movies made for theatrical release .

     In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> 's takeover fever , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere de Paribas</ENAMEX> said it intends to bid for one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's other large financial and industrial holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie. de Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> said that once it receives the go-ahead from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> stock market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> , it will offer to boost its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> stake to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.7 %</NUMEX> from the current <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.7 %</NUMEX> .
     Its cash-or-shares bid values <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 22.82 billion francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.62 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- , making this one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's largest-ever attempted takeovers .
     The cost of buying the additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</NUMEX> stake would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.95 billion francs</NUMEX> -LRB- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.74 billion</NUMEX> -RRB- .
     The move would greatly boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's stake in the insurance , transport and food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">businesses</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> is strong .
     It also would make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">ally</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz AG</ENAMEX> insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> holds a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> 's insurance interests , acquired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three weeks ago</TIMEX> .
     Those include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Rhin et Moselle Vie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Via Assurances</ENAMEX> .
     Long considered a potential takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">target</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> had hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> would help protect it from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">raiders</ENAMEX> .
     That idea may have backfired .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> 's main <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bank</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">Munich</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> said it intends to stay neutral .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> said it would n't have any comment until its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">board</ENAMEX> meets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> is loosely held and hard to defend .
     `` The defensive options are limited , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Braye</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in portfolio management concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">France Finance Quatre</ENAMEX> .
     `` Who would bid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> ? ''
     If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> bid succeeds , it will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two months</TIMEX> a big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> has snapped up an insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Last month</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">archrival</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Cie . Financiere de Suez</ENAMEX> , won a battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Groupe Victoire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurer</ENAMEX> , which itself had just acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">West Germany</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Colonia Versicherung AG</ENAMEX> .
     That complex bid was billed as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's largest takeover ever -LRB- this one is slightly smaller -RRB- .
     Moreover , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suez</ENAMEX> had just finished winning an even larger battle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last year</TIMEX> for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Societe Generale de Belgique</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> , once considered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's toughest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> , felt abashed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Suez</ENAMEX> 's success and its rapid growth .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> denies it , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest investment banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> .
     It also reflects the broader pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:CONTINENT">Europe</ENAMEX> to keep up as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">European Community</ENAMEX> prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1992</TIMEX> .
     Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Francois-Poncet</ENAMEX> would n't rule out eventually selling all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> 's insurance operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> , he stressed the potential for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">groups</ENAMEX> instead to cooperate .
     He also told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> the acquisition would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> fresh diversity , bringing it properties in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">food</ENAMEX> and transport where it has been weak .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">bakery</ENAMEX> and bus and trucking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">firms</ENAMEX> , among others .
     And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> has a huge hidden attraction .
     Payment by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Allianz</ENAMEX> for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">concern</ENAMEX> 's treasury to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated 11 billion francs</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> said it will bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,850 francs</NUMEX> a share for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> shares that qualify for a full <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">yearly</TIMEX> dividend , and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,800 francs</NUMEX> for those created <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1</TIMEX> , which are eligible for partial dividends .
     Alternatively , it said it would offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Jan. 1</TIMEX> , for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> share .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> shares closed down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 francs</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">610 francs</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> shares were suspended at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,800 francs</NUMEX> pending the outcome of the bid .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> said it would publish details of its bid once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> clear it .
     This is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes .
     Some financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said privately that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois-Poncet</ENAMEX> responded that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> initially intended to take only a minority stake , striking an alliance with current management .
     When notoriously independent-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Fournier</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> 's offer and began buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> shares in retaliation , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois-Poncet</ENAMEX> said , he felt obliged to bid for control .
     He told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> he had information that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fournier</ENAMEX> was preparing to buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> , up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5 %</NUMEX> currently .
     A bid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Paribas</ENAMEX> could n't be ruled out .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">France</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest government-owned insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Assurances Generales de France</ENAMEX> , has been building its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> stake , currently thought to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 8 % and 10 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> could n't be reached .

     Crude oil futures prices fell further as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">producers</ENAMEX> are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the traditionally weak first quarter</TIMEX> .
     In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT:OTHER">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 cents</NUMEX> a barrel to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 19.76</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> delivery .
     Petroleum products prices also declined .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> pointed to reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ENAMEX> is producing substantially more than its official limit of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">20.5 million barrels</NUMEX> a day , with some accounts putting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">nation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">group</ENAMEX> 's output <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:3D">as high as 23 million barrels</NUMEX> a day .
     That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX> , when demand is traditionally strong .
     But because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">first-quarter</TIMEX> demand is normally the weakest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the year</TIMEX> , several market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> say , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:OTHER">OPEC</ENAMEX> production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:OTHER">group</ENAMEX> plans to meet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a month</TIMEX> to discuss production strategy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">early 1990</TIMEX> .
     With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Houston Ship Channel</ENAMEX> also was bearish for prices .
     Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">crude</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> say , now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">facility</ENAMEX> wo n't need any , at a time of already high availability .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">plant</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polyethylene</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">polypropylene</ENAMEX> and other plastic products .
     A company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said the explosions began when a seal blew out .
     <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were injured , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> said .
     There was no immediate estimate of damage from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     Some petroleum futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
     For instance , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">below $ 20</NUMEX> a barrel .
     `` Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> is a little bearish now that we 've taken out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX> , '' he said .
     In other commodity markets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">COPPER</ENAMEX> :
     The selling that started on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract fell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.85 cents</NUMEX> a pound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.1960</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> warehouse stocks were down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">only 4,800 metric tons</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the week</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">84,500 tons</NUMEX> ; expectations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late last week</TIMEX> were a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">10,000 to 15,000 tons</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> market made its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> on the opening and when it dropped below the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.23</NUMEX>-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> bailed out of their positions and aggressive short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> -- anticipating further declines -- moved in .
     Fund selling also picked up at that point .
     According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Savaiko</ENAMEX> , senior commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> , the only stability to the market came when short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts .
     This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">U.S.</ENAMEX> copper market .
     Such support usually comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> who use a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> .
     `` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">Copper</ENAMEX> has been stuck in a trading range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.19 to $ 1.34</NUMEX> .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> believes that if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:CHEMICAL">copper</ENAMEX> falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 1.04</NUMEX> .
     PRECIOUS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">METALS</ENAMEX> :
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Platinum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">palladium</ENAMEX> struggled to maintain their prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">all day</TIMEX> despite news stories over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> that recent cold fusion experiments , which use both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> , showed signs of producing extra heat .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">January</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">platinum</ENAMEX> closed down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.80</NUMEX> an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 486.30</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $ 4</NUMEX> above its low for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">palladium</ENAMEX> was off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.55</NUMEX> an ounce at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 137.20</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">Platinum</ENAMEX> is believed to have good support <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 480</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">palladium</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 130</NUMEX> .
     Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report , which will be released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> .
     Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> because both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> are used in automobile catalytic converters .
     Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> theorized that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> because many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> have already been badly burnt by such stories .
     He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">palladium</ENAMEX> again .
     Also weighing on both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">metals</ENAMEX> ' prices is the role of the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">supplier</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> ' thirst for dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this year</TIMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">grain</ENAMEX> and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">GRAINS</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SOYBEANS</ENAMEX> :
     Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news .
     On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">soybeans</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5.63</NUMEX> a bushel , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half a cent</NUMEX> , while the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">wheat</ENAMEX> contract rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three-quarters of a cent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.0775</NUMEX> a bushel .
     Supporting prices was the announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">late Friday</TIMEX> of additional grain sales to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
     But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and the prospect for continued fair weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">this week</TIMEX> over much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Farm Belt</ENAMEX> .
     Strong farmer selling over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the weekend</TIMEX> also weighed on prices .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">SUGAR</ENAMEX> : World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">March</TIMEX> contract ended at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.79 cents</NUMEX> a pound , down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.37 cent</NUMEX> .
     For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">the past week</TIMEX> or so , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> have been expecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> to buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">between 150,000 and 200,000 tons</NUMEX> of refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> .
     But with no reports of either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> actually entering the market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said , futures prices became vulnerable .
     Developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">India</ENAMEX> , some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> reached the top of its trading range , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 14.75 cents</NUMEX> , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 13.50 cents</NUMEX> .
     But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Dunlaevy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Balfour Maclaine International Ltd.</ENAMEX> , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speculators</ENAMEX> , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . ''
     A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">four million metric tons</NUMEX> and only a modest increase in consumption , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">sugar</ENAMEX> is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:COUNTRY">country</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">COCOA</ENAMEX> :
     Futures rallied modestly .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">December</TIMEX> contract rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 33</NUMEX> a metric ton to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,027</NUMEX> , near its high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Gill & Duffus Ltd.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> cocoa-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">house</ENAMEX> , estimated that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1989-90</TIMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> surplus would be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">231,000 tons</NUMEX> , down from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY:WEIGHT">314,000 tons</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> .
     Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies .
     Recent prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> have been near levels last seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX> .
     At such prices , according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> is n't uncommon .
     But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> expects stepped-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> selling at around the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,040 to $ 1,050</NUMEX> level .
     He also noted that a strong sterling market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> might have helped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitragers</ENAMEX> took advantage of the currency move .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Kaul</ENAMEX> , research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> , said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> , a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:FOOD">cocoa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">producer</ENAMEX> .

     The bond market , which sometimes thrives on bad news , cheered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker .
     Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> , bonds rose modestly on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> ' forecasts that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble .
     Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession .
     For example , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Department of Commerce</ENAMEX> is scheduled to release the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> durable goods report .
     The consensus forecast of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Dow Jones Capital Markets Report</ENAMEX> is for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2 %</NUMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">September</TIMEX> orders .
     That would follow a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> advance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">August</TIMEX> .
     Bonds received a bigger boost later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the day</TIMEX> when stock prices moved broadly lower .
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.23</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2662.91</NUMEX> .
     `` Bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have been watching stocks closely , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Marver</ENAMEX> , chief fixed-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Technical Data Global Markets Group</ENAMEX> .
     `` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/2</NUMEX> point higher , or up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 5</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1,000</NUMEX> face amount , while the yield slid to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.98 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     Municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose .
     Prices of high-yield , high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged .
     In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</NUMEX> issue by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imo Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> was snapped up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice Co.</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> .
     In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">this week</TIMEX> as the market takes in positive and negative news .
     `` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William M. Brachfeld</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Daiwa Securities America Inc .</ENAMEX>
     `` On the other hand , we have economic news that is -LCB- expected to be -RCB- relatively positive for the bond market .

     So far , money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and other bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> have n't shown much interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Refcorp</ENAMEX> bonds .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> have mixed views about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two-year</TIMEX> note auction .
     While some say the auction should proceed smoothly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> contend that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> 's sale of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.58 billion</NUMEX> of asset-backed securities by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Credit Corp.</ENAMEX> may have siphoned some potential institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">buyers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's note sale .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">division</ENAMEX> of auto maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest issue in the market 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">four-year</TIMEX> history .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston Corp</ENAMEX> .
     The issue yields <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.90 %</NUMEX> and carries a guarantee covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> of the deal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">company</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering .
     The issue was offered at a yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one</NUMEX> percentage point above the yield on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two-year</TIMEX> Treasurys .
     The only asset-backed deal larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 's was a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4 billion</NUMEX> offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">General Motors Acceptance Corp.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1986</TIMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/2</NUMEX> point higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> in light trading .
     The benchmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">30-year</TIMEX> bond ended at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 3\/32</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 17\/32</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Friday</TIMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10-year</TIMEX> notes were quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 17\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.90 %</NUMEX> , compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 3\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.97 %</NUMEX> .
     The latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">two-year</TIMEX> notes were quoted late at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 28\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.84 %</NUMEX> .
     Short-term rates rose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:GOVERNMENT">government</ENAMEX> 's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.81 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">three-month</TIMEX> bills with an average discount rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.52 %</NUMEX> , the highest since the average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.63 %</NUMEX> at the auction on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 10</TIMEX> .
     The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7.81 billion</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">six-month</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills were sold with an average discount rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.50 %</NUMEX> , the highest since the average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.60 %</NUMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 10</TIMEX> auction .
     The rates were up from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> 's auction , when they were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.37 %</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.42 %</NUMEX> , respectively .
     Here are auction details :
     Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
     Thus , higher bidding narrows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> 's return while lower bidding widens it .
     The percentage rates are calculated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 360-day year</TIMEX> , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">a 365-day year</TIMEX> .
     Both issues are dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Oct. 26</TIMEX> .
     The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">13-week</TIMEX> bills mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">Jan. 25 , 1990</TIMEX> , and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">26-week</TIMEX> bills mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">April 26 , 1990</TIMEX> .
     Corporate Issues
     Investment-grade corporates closed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1\/4</NUMEX> point higher in quiet trading .
     In the junk bond market , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Imo Industries</ENAMEX> ' issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Karches</ENAMEX> , managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> , said the issue was oversubscribed .
     `` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have an appetite for it , '' he said .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> is expected to price another junk bond deal , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 350 million</NUMEX> of senior subordinated debentures by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Continental Cablevision Inc.</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">next Tuesday</TIMEX> .
     In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> .
     In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</NUMEX> portion of the offering .
     Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> at a fixed spread above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasurys</ENAMEX> .
     Under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:OTHER">annually</TIMEX> at a rate to maintain a market value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> .
     Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 %</NUMEX> .
     Mortgage-Backed Securities
     Activity in derivative markets was strong with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's session .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.2 billion</NUMEX> of Remic securities in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> issues , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> offered a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 250 million</NUMEX> Remic backed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">15-year</TIMEX> securities .
     Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">thrifts</ENAMEX> have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">the past two weeks</TIMEX> .
     In the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> market .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">November</TIMEX> delivery were quoted late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98 10\/32</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10\/32</NUMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> securities were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 1\/2</NUMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/4</NUMEX> .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</NUMEX> issue was yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.36 %</NUMEX> to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">12-year</TIMEX> average life assumption , as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">10-year</TIMEX> note widened slightly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.46</NUMEX> percentage points .
     Municipals
     A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 575 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector .
     The refunding issue , which had been in the wings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">two months</TIMEX> , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation .
     But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/8</NUMEX> point .
     An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> said orders for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">San Antonio</ENAMEX> bonds were `` on the slow side . ''
     He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace .
     In addition , he noted , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> , but recent disasters , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT:HURRICANE">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake , have stretched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">insurers</ENAMEX> ' resources and damped their demand for bonds .
     A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 137.6 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Maryland Stadium Authority</ENAMEX> sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start .
     The issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Morgan Stanley </ENAMEX>.
     Activity quieted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:CITY">New York City</ENAMEX> bond market , where heavy investor selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">last week</TIMEX> drove yields on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:CORPORATION">issuer</ENAMEX> 's full faith and credit backed bonds up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 0.50</NUMEX> percentage point .
     Foreign Bonds
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> government bonds ended lower after the dollar rose modestly against the yen .
     The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:COUNTRY">Japan</ENAMEX> 's bond market .
     The benchmark No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1998</TIMEX> ended on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> ' screens at a price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.39</NUMEX> , off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.28</NUMEX> .
     The yield rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.38 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> bond prices ended lower after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">a day</TIMEX> of aimless trading .
     The benchmark <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</NUMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX> point to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.80</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.03 %</NUMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 3\/4 %</NUMEX> notes due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">July 1994</TIMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97.65</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.34 %</NUMEX> .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> looked ahead to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">today</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> trade report .
     The benchmark <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3\/4 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:GOVERNMENT">Treasury</ENAMEX> bond due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">2003\/2007</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1\/8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 21\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.11 %</NUMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</NUMEX> issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DATE">1995</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3\/32</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 23\/32</NUMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.01 %</NUMEX> .

     `` The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">croaker</ENAMEX> 's done gone from the hook --
     damn !
     My language sure goes to pot down here on the coast . ''
     The husky blond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">Aggie</ENAMEX> cap twists his face in mock fury .

     There have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE:DURATION">three days</TIMEX> of hot , wind-swept rain , and now with the first sun we are after speckled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">seatrout</ENAMEX> , which with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">redfish</ENAMEX> provides most of the game fishing hereabouts .
     The little radio fizzes as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> want to see if we have found any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> -- spotting location is everything in this sport .
     Negative answers crackle back .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC:VEHICLE">ships</ENAMEX> .
     We go from one to the other .
     The sun is hot now though it 's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 8 in the morning</TIMEX> .
     The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE:OTHER">water</ENAMEX> .
     We cruise toward another set of pilings .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">croaker</ENAMEX> on the hook .
     Then he casts out .
     `` Just wait for that tap-tap , that thump-thump .
     It comes real gentle before it pulls .

     A pair of black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">skimmers</ENAMEX> zig-zag past close to the surface .

     And we are the first back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:OTHER">dock</ENAMEX> , where the great blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX> stand waiting by the cleaning benches .
     The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is young and he knows this business but he wants a different life after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC:EDUCATIONAL">college</ENAMEX> , such as working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION:CORPORATION">IBM</ENAMEX> and wearing a necktie .
     This must be the last big stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP:NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> seacoast that is `` undeveloped . ''
     There are a few ramshackle fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC:CITY">towns</ENAMEX> with quiet atolls of resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">houses</ENAMEX> nearby .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves .
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE:STATE_PROVINCE">Texas</ENAMEX> is big and beautiful and they live here , that 's all .
     Jutting out just to the north of us is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:REGION">Blackjack Peninsula</ENAMEX> -LRB- after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> , not the game -RRB- which forms the core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION:OTHER">Aransas Wildlife Refuge</ENAMEX> .

     He paid an immense fine and was lucky , according to a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wag</ENAMEX> , to escape the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC:BUILDING">chamber</ENAMEX> .

     Near the coast there are dense coverts of live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> interspersed with marshes and prairies .
